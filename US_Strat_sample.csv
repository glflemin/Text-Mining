"2",109095,"US","Here's a big, rich, extracted Cabernet, filled with fruit, yet balanced with a bracing minerality that must come from the earth.

"5",120298,"US","There's a beautiful wine in this Cabernet blend, which was grown at the foot of Howell Mountain. But it's not showing its best now. Just too tannic, and the fruity flavors are all primary and unintegrated with the new oak barrels.

"6",148972,"US","A fig, herb and grapefruit bouquet sets the stage.

"7",131507,"US","Last year's bottling was a hard act to follow, but Mauritson's done it again.

"812",106694,"US","Big aromas of pineapple, citrus and flowers lead on this Chardonnay/Pinot Grigio blend. On the palate, lemon, ripe fruit and honey flavors are sweet and somewhat aggressive. A fun wine to pair with cheeses, dessert.","Manitou",83,10,"Michigan","Leelanau Peninsula","","Chardonnay-Pinot Gris","Good Harbor"
"813",108356,"US","A lovely drink from a winery in Massachusetts where all they produce is apple ice wine. One sip and you're instantly transported to standing in an orchard on a brisk fall afternoon, with forward aromas and flavors of baked apples with soft spice, caramel and tangerine citrus. Full in the mouth with moderate acidity and a crisp, clean finish.","Apfel Eis Apple Ice Wine",89,25,"Massachusetts","Massachusetts","","Apple","Still River"

"815",114160,"US","From the Sanel Valley, a wine that smells better than it tastes. The aroma is evocative and inviting, with gooseberry, lime zest sweetened with honey, and vanilla notes. But itÕs strangely inert in the mouth. The citrusy flavors are watery and thin.","Pantianna Ranch",84,25,"California","Mendocino","Mendocino/Lake Counties","Sauvignon Musqué","White Oak"
"816",126119,"US","Fruity and easy, this soft wine has sweet flavors of apricots and caramel. Valdiguié, formerly known as Napa Gamay, is a red grape, and that accounts for the note of crushed raspberries.","",84,17,"California","Madera","Central Valley","Viognier-Valdiguié","Westbrook Wine Farm"
"817",127230,"US","Dry, crisp and slightly viscous, this white shows excessive vanilla from oak treatment that smothers the fruit expression. Medium, buttery finish.","Estate",82,30,"Kentucky","Kentucky","","Chardonelle","Elk Creek Vineyards"
"818",131001,"US","A 50–50 blend, this shows fruit flavors of plum and currant, hints of orange peel and citrus, and assertive, fairly stiff tannins. It's set up for steak, beef and grilled meats, which will work well with the tannins. I'd let it breathe for an hour or two to soften it up and bring out the fruit.","",88,25,"Washington","Columbia Valley (WA)","Columbia Valley","Malbec-Merlot","Three Rivers"
"819",131119,"US","Outside of a couple of Michigan wineries, Adelsheim may be the only domestic producer of this obscure white grape, a cross between Pinot Noir and Gouais Blanc.

"821",139876,"US","Viognier lends a bright, floral note and citrusy acidity to this Syrah's plums and blackberries. Still, this is a medium-bodied, dry red wine with a firmly tannic finish.","Reserve Selection",86,14,"California","Monterey County","Central Coast","Shiraz-Viognier","Hayman & Hill"
"822",142807,"US","The 7% Viognier goes a long way. The big, bright boost of citrus and acidity dominates. The Syrah itself is soft and plummy-chocolaty, with a smear of tannins.","Reserve Selection",84,14,"California","Monterey County","Central Coast","Shiraz-Viognier","Hayman & Hill"
