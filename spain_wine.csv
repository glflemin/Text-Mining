7241,Spain,"Dusty cherry and red-plum aromas are simple and clean.

Drink this year.",NA,86,9,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Rosado,Marqués de Cáceres
7244,Spain,"Blackberry and herbal aromas vie with raw oak and heat on the bouquet of this chunky, jammy, slightly sloppy feeling Monastrell.

7251,Spain,"Earthy, stalky, rubbery berry and plum aromas are solid but rustic. This has a tight, juicy, tomato-like feel and raw flavors of red plum and currant. A hold-steady finish with tomato and mild herbal notes closes this out.",NA,85,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Cota 585

7299,Spain,"This is the granddaddy in the Emilio Moro portfolio, but the wine is so ripe and oaky it's syrupy-smelling.

7324,Spain,"Appealing modern-leaning aromas of root beer, berry fruits and vanilla settle with airing and turn more mellow and traditional for Rioja. Slightly plush on the palate, especially given 2013's cool nature, this is balanced despite showing raw tannins.

7473,Spain,"Dusty berry, resin and bell-pepper aromas suggest a marginally ripe wine with plenty of oak.

7537,Spain,"Dusty aromas are about it for the nose. This sweet rosé offers sugary flavors of strawberry and red licorice candy.

10355,Spain,"Cool rooty aromas of cola and tree bark grace the nose on this ripe but still not fully mature Cabernet Sauvignon (with 5% Merlot). In the mouth, this is choppy due to sandpaper tannins.

12921,Spain,"Raw aromas of rhubarb and scratchy raspberry offer little to latch onto. The palate feels clipped and angular, while the flavors are a touch stalky and generic as far as red fruit goes. This finishes tangy and scouring.",Viña Alarde Crianza,83,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Berberana
12923,Spain,"With its day-glo pink color, this smells stalky and lacks the aromatic freshness one seeks in rosé. The mouthfeel is reasonably lively and grabby, with briny, pickled citrus flavors in front of a briny tasting finish.",Vivanco Tempranillo-Garnacha,83,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Rosé,Dinastía Vivanco
12924,Spain,"Medicinal cherry and plum aromas are smothered in milk chocolate scents that turn more animal and leathery with airing. The palate is chunky but dull in feel, with generic red-berry flavors covered with candied oak and herbal notes.",NA,83,11,Levante,Alicante,NA,Monastrell,Toscar
12925,Spain,"With almost no color, this spritzy rosado is prickly and feline on the nose, like Sauvignon Blanc or Verdejo. The palate is lightly bubbly, with bounce and tart tangerine and herbal flavors. Txomin Etxaníz has never made a commercial rosé prior to this. This makes you wonder why they did.",Getaria,83,25,Northern Spain,Getariako Txakolina,NA,Rosé,Txomín Etxaníz
12959,Spain,"A wide, open bouquet is home to aromas of tree bark, toast, stewed black fruits, herbs and spice. This is big but well built, with muscular, scraping tannins. Earthy, saucy flavors of berry and plum finish with notes of chocolate, sea salt, herbs and leather. Drink through 2022.",NA,92,33,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tempranillo,Garcilaso
13003,Spain,"Earthy, damp aromas suggest compost but there's enough fresh black-fruit character to keep the bouquet balanced. This feels dense, saturated and heavy, with a syrupy leaning and full tannins. Flavors of baked blackberry and vanilla end a little stewy and soft. Drink through 2017.",Spiga,90,30,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,O. Fournier
13030,Spain,"Earth, moss, vanilla and oak aromas accent blackberry and dark plum scents.

Drink through 2015.",Altos de Losada,91,38,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Losada
13039,Spain,"Blueberry, rubber and mint are the key aromas on what amounts to a linear, narrow nose. This Tempranillo-led blend is juicy and fresh in feel as opposed to thick and heavy.

13050,Spain,"Talk about a consistent wine. The past four vintages of 4 Varietales have all scored 91 points. This version opens with dense, jammy blackberry and raspberry aromas.

Drink through 2020.",Reserva,89,20,Northern Spain,Cigales,NA,Tempranillo,Museum
13114,Spain,"Fleshy apple and peach aromas lead to a medium-bodied palate. Standard flavors of stone fruits are nice but simple, while this blend of Viura and Malvasia finishes with light notes of apple and nectarine.",NA,87,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Baron De Ley
13128,Spain,"A somewhat flat baked jammy nose offers up a helping dose of oak spice. This feels chunky but largely healthy, while oaky minty flavors of berry fruits and plum show a tomato-like quality on a blocky finish.",Viña Real Crianza,87,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,CVNE
13129,Spain,"Clean direct melon and tropical-fruit aromas are simple but nice. This feels light and fresh, without much weight or body.

13133,Spain,Initial aromas of chlorine and raw plum settle and become more fruity and attractive with airing. This shows a forward fresh sassy palate with clipped rugged tannins.

13134,Spain,"Light aromas of mango, melon and lime are quiet but clean. This is a simple but fresh white with a crisp stony mouthfeel. Easygoing flavors of melon and apple finish with a note of lime as well as a hint of wheaty yeast.",X,87,13,Catalonia,Catalunya,NA,Xarel-lo,Bohigas
13135,Spain,"Aromas of stewed berry fruits and damp leaves lack freshness but are not spoiled. This Garnacha-based blend feels thick and resiny, almost to the point of syrupy.

13244,Spain,"This is more brown than burnished gold in color, while it smells of toffee, brandy and maple syrup. Salty caramel and peanut flavors finish like a peanut butter cookie bathed in salt.

13278,Spain,"This is waxy on the nose, with the aromatic spunk of nettle and sweaty citrus. It feels fresh, minerally and zesty, with citrus, apple and green herb flavors. It's solid, smooth and elegant on the finish, which turns slightly bitter as it concludes.",NA,89,22,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Blanco Nieva

13357,Spain,"Smells like air freshener and white flowers. The palate is spongey and a bit low on life, while the flavors lean toward citrus but lack purity and zap, which is further drilled in on the waxy finish.

13376,Spain,"Opens with pasty, oaky aromas and very little fruit or clarity. The palate is flat in feel and thick, with woody, medicinal flavors.

13515,Spain,"Gritty cassis aromas are oaky and challenging, which is what you can get when a wine spends more than three years in oak. In the mouth, this is wiry and rubbery. Foxy plum and cherry flavors finish clampy and herbal. Very good but with a few holes and pitfalls.",Cerro Añon Gran Reserva,89,38,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Olarra
13517,Spain,"Gritty earthy aromas come up short on freshness and clarity. This feels raw and pinching, with dry rubbing tannins. Gritty peppery berry flavors are oaky, while this finishes with savory berry, herb and tobacco flavors. Hammering tannins suggest decanting and/or service with hearty foods.",Reserva,89,50,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Salcis

13565,Spain,"A light, elegant berry aroma transitions to notes of plum and blackberry with airing.

This is a proper Rioja for near-term drinking.",Cosme Palacio Reserva,89,25,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Palacio
13566,Spain,"Jammy raspberry aromas are easygoing and come with a hint of tobacco. It feels grabby but good, with lots of spice, pepper, herb and dark fruit flavors on the palate. The finish is healthy and well lifted, with a light but fresh herbal accent.",Glorioso Reserva Especial,89,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Palacio
13587,Spain,"This needs air to show its best, because at first it's tight, mulchy and nutty. Early on, it feels clampy and scratchy, but it becomes better as it airs. The black fruit flavors are touched up by notes of oak, dried cheese and leather—characteristics that extend onto the finish.",Selección Especial,89,62,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Pago de Sangara
13627,Spain,"This reserva blend of Tempranillo, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon offers aromas of lead pencil and mossy berry. The lively palate deals coconut, spice, lemon peel and wild berry flavors. This is a powerful wine that will benefit from airing.",Reserva,90,40,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Red Blend,Finca Albret
13645,Spain,"Woodsy and smooth smelling, with integrated spice and black-fruit aromas. It feels like a padded vise grip, with demanding tannins and blackberry, toast and coffee flavors that narrow down due to tannic astringency.

13654,Spain,"Smells roasted and stemmy, with a burnt leaf and turned earth quality to the bouquet. Herbal, scratchy berry and plum flavors feel rough and don't exhibit enough freshness. Simply put: it's a leafy, muddled Ribera wine.",Torre de Golbán Crianza,83,17,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto Fino,Atalayas de Golbán
13658,Spain,"Mealy and heavy smelling, but with decent background fruit aromas and sweetness. Frankly, this already seems to be past its prime, evidenced by creamy, flat flavors of bland fruit and caramel. The finish needs snap and crispness but doesn't have any; a bit too sweet, candied and bitter already.",NA,83,8,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Rosé,Borsao
13668,Spain,"Heavy and nutty, almost like movie popcorn. In due time the nose transitions to creamy berry and cranberry. The palate is soft and muddled, with some citrus and red apple. Sweet and tomatoey on the finish; needs more focus, acidity and dryness.",Cabernet Sauvignon Rosado,83,20,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Rosé,Enate
13669,Spain,"A bit sharp, stemmy and sour smelling. But the fruit flavors are solid and the herbal cherry and plum character that leads the palate improves with airing. Herbal on the finish; standard as a whole.",NA,83,11,Levante,Yecla,NA,Monastrell-Syrah,Evine
13679,Spain,"This warm-climate Viura hits with plodding barrel aromas and flavors but there's not a lot of high-quality natural material to support that much faux/forced oak. Along the way it hints at mealy apple, spice, cinnamon powder and resin. A lot of noise but not much music.",Blanco,83,8,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Viura,Borsao
13785,Spain,"Meaty leathery blackberry aromas are less dressed up and polished than in past vintages. This Mencía feels jammy, wide and chunky, while flavors of spicy blackberry are limited. A toasty oaky lightly charred finish closes out this full-bodied offering from a tough cool year.",NA,89,20,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Losada
13837,Spain,"A recommended entry-level Ribera, with aromas of violets, minerals and oak. The palate has a standard, competent feel and balance along with flavors of gangly berry fruit and black cherry. Mocha and vanilla help sweeten and soften up the finish, but overall it's a regular, fresh type of wine.",Finca Resalso,87,15,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto Fino,Emilio Moro
13850,Spain,"Aromas of black fruits, light oak and violets are good but basic, and that pretty much defines the rest of the wine.

Nicely done and approachable.",Al Muvedre Tinto Joven,87,15,Levante,Alicante,NA,Monastrell,Telmo Rodríguez
13852,Spain,"A jammy, fruity, extracted Tempranillo with simple, candied berry aromas followed by a heavy, bulky palate that's packed with warm berry fruit. A rich, young, jumpy sweetie that's designed to make you happy.",Codice,87,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
13858,Spain,"Nice and prickly, with aromas of nettles, citrus and minerals. The palate is fresh and acidic, while the flavors of green apple, scallion, pineapple, lemon and grapefruit come together well. Clean and not overly acidic on the finish. Varietally speaking, this is on the money.",Azumbre Viñedos Centenarios,87,18,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Agricola Castellana
13859,Spain,"A full-bodied red blend from Montsant. The nose is big and smells of black cherry, licorice and herbal, foresty notes, while the palate is saturated and grabby at the edges, with herb-tinged, roasted-berry flavors. Snappy and cheek-starching on the finish; drink now through 2011.",Etim Selección,87,18,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Red Blend,Agricola Falset-Marca
13897,Spain,"Compared to the excellent 2006, this wine is heavier, riper and jammier at every check point. The nose is baked and raisiny, while the palate feels saturated to the extreme and gritty as well. The primary flavors run toward baked plum and blackberry, while licorice, leather and raisin notes carry the finish. Give this lots of air after opening, about an hour or so.",Partida Bellvisos,89,130,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Gratallops
13898,Spain,"Attractive and fruity on the front end, this has pure berry aromas but not a lot of nuance or complexity.

Juicy, bright and solid on the finish.",Secreto Reserva,89,NA,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Mayor
13934,Spain,"Earthy, savory berry aromas are rubbery, while this feels fleshy and jammy. Young woody flavors outweigh the wine's basic fruit notes, while this tastes toasty on the finish.",NA,88,19,Galicia,Ribeira Sacra,NA,Mencía,Adrás
13958,Spain,"Heavy aromas of orange marmalade and honey come across as unconvincing. The palate follows suit with bland, soft, chubby cantaloupe and green melon flavors. Finishes soft and dilute; seems like it's already dying in the bottle.",NA,83,13,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Vega Murillo
13960,Spain,"Rough and leathery, with roasted black fruit and burnt-leaf aromas. The palate has a clacky, sharp feel and flavors of dried, baked berry fruits and leaves. Hard, roasted and leathery red wine.",Crianza,83,11,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Albali
13966,Spain,"Lean raspberry and cherry aromas are the best part because the palate is rather raw and acidic, which causes raspiness and a tough mouthfeel. Flavors are sharp and red fruited, and there's an oak and vanilla element that's not that well integrated.",Selección,82,9,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo,Fundatio
13967,Spain,"Expensive for what you get. The nose is a weird mix of salami and sweetness, and the palate is a syrupy, globular blend of cloying oak, caramel syrup and candied banana. Way too much wood and vanilla here, and not nearly enough balance or purity.",Blanc de Montsalvat,82,40,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,White Blend,Francesc Sanchez Bas
13971,Spain,"Smells lightly burnt and acrid, with stemmy berry aromas, apricot and match stick. The palate has a flat, creamy feel and stemmy, dry flavors of generic berry and bitterness. Too flat and devoid of fruit to rate higher.",Viña Main Rosado Tempranillo,82,12,Central Spain,Vinos de Madrid,NA,Rosé,Bodegas Orusco
13972,Spain,"Sharp, rubbery, stemmy aromas lead to an edgy palate with herbal, burnt, semigreen berry flavors. Finishes green and a bit weedy; acceptable but nothing to get excited over.",Clave del Secreto,82,9,Levante,Alicante,NA,Monastrell,La Bodega de Pinoso
13984,Spain,"Impressive for a 2008 Tempranillo. This opens with aromas of balsam wood, spice, blackberry and plum. The feel is grippy and intense, with notes of roasted berry, black olive, leather and a mildly-salty flavor. It finishes meaty, lightly herbal and slightly salinic, with a firm feel. Drink now through 2014.",El Albar Lurton Barricas,90,25,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tinta de Toro,François Lurton
13986,Spain,"Gets rolling with a blitz of dark berry, cedar, bramble and graphite aromas. It feels punchy for being a dark-style red, with meaty black-fruit flavors. On the palate, it turns juicier and more rugged as the acidity steps up, ultimately finishing thick but catchy, with peppery spice. A blend of Tempranillo, Cabernet and Merlot.",Juan de Albret Crianza,90,35,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Red Blend,Finca Albret
13993,Spain,"This is floral and minerally on the nose, with notes of tobacco and bold berry. Feels structured and solid, with dark berry, carob and sweet mocha flavors.

13994,Spain,"Smoky and earthy smelling, with aromas of tobacco, subtle spice and dried cherry. This feels tight, with more acidity than body at this point in its evolution.

Drink now.",Pago de las Costanas,90,53,Northern Spain,Cigales,NA,Tempranillo,Val de Los Frailes
14130,Spain,"Citrus and apple aromas are fresh, reserved and on the light side. In the mouth, this pops with lemony acidity and related tang.

Settles well on the finish, with good length and more than adequate purity.",Crianza,87,18,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Dios Ares
14171,Spain,"Fairly dense and slightly herbal on the nose, with balsamic notes, dried cheese and mature fruit aromas. This is still spunky and well composed in the mouth, with flavors of tobacco, earthy berry and toasty oak. Shows weight and grab on the finish. An honest, mature wine to drink now; it's not going to improve.",Care Bancales,87,30,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Garnacha-Cabernet,Bodegas Añadas
14172,Spain,"Nice on the nose, with berry aromas, ample richness and rubber.

14175,Spain,"A chunky, thick, earthy type of wine with syrupy, sweet berry flavors and a friendly palate that's tannic but not too much so.

14184,Spain,"A Priorat blend made in a softer, more simple style. The nose has plum, prune, licorice and rooty scents, which precedes a thick, sweet palate that has mild tannic grip and flavors of raisin, black plum and wild berry. Plump and broad, with good depth.",Isaral,87,46,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Prior Pons
14188,Spain,"Good for a mature wine but it does smell a bit flat and damp. That murkiness blows off somewhat, leaving a solid, aged Rioja wine with acidic zap and lightly baked berry, cherry, tomato and spice flavors. Mild on the finish. Drink now.",Gran Reserva,87,40,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Ramirez de la Piscina

14281,Spain,"All indigenous grapes are welcomed by our tasting panel, but sometimes they are unknown and little used for a reason. This wine, made from the local Maturana Tinta, is a green, mean, lean wine with herbal aromas and flavors that, let's face it, are vegetal.

14292,Spain,"Raisiny and thin smelling at the same time. The palate is dilute, citric and sheering, with tangy red currant and citrus flavors. Acidity keeps it vital but there's little flavor, body and structure. Ends up thin and sour.",Viña Honda Crianza,81,20,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Silvano Garcia
14294,Spain,"Smells like mealy fruit and bananas, while the palate is weak in constitution and a bit spritzy in feel. Tastes like bland white fruits with vanilla. Cloying on the finish.",Dama de Toro,80,11,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Malvasia,Bodegas Fariña
14295,Spain,"There's a reason Airén is used as a base grape for brandy and Sherry wines, and it's because it's not up to table-wine quality, even at the value price point. This wine is corny and lacks freshness. It's dull, wayward and offers little to no structure. Barely drinkable.",Airén,80,9,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Airen,Sierra Virgen
14296,Spain,Smells like fruit juice. Overall it's raisiny and pruney. Drinkable but barely. Doesn't bring clarity or proper balance.,Organic,80,16,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Ardales
14370,Spain,"A sweet, raisiny old-vines Garnacha with candied aromas and a fat, chunky body that houses soft, short black fruit and peppery flavors. Tastes like licorice candy on the finish, which brings some heat and burn as well. An interesting Grenache that is sweet but isn't over the top in terms of ripeness.",Secastilla,87,30,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Grenache,Viñas del Vero
14386,Spain,"Rusty in color, with initial aromas of smoke, dried leaves, herbs, tobacco and subtle berry. That all indicates that it's not overdone, and thus the tobacco, earth and dried fruit flavors are par for the course. Dry and leafy on the finish, which indicates that now is the time to get at it.",Real de Aragón Centenaria,86,18,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Garnacha,Pagos Familia Langa
14390,Spain,"Darker and earthier than most basic Garnachas, with aromas of compost, baked earth, crusty black fruits and leather.

Toasty and solid on the finish.",Kickass,86,13,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Garnacha,El Burro
14395,Spain,"Definitely an herbal wine, with tomato, oregano, pizza sauce and savory aromas. The palate has good snap and verve to it, while the feel is on the lean side.

14427,Spain,"Berry candy and licorice aromas become more subtle and earthy with air. It feels grabby and abrasive as many Toro's are prone to be, with blackberry and root notes and a sugar beet flavor. The slightly hot, candied finish holds onto that rooty character.",NA,88,32,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Monte Hiniesta
14469,Spain,"A little richer and slightly more oaked than Beronia's basic '06 Rioja, this crianza has a nice red-fruit character, body weight and plump, friendly flavors of raspberry and red plum.

14477,Spain,"Opening pastry aromas are a bit heavy, but the palate is solid and balanced, and the flavors of gooseberry, green herbs and apple work.

14488,Spain,"A ripe and rich style, with black cherry, raisin and a hint of candy on the nose. The palate shows some bulk and a bit of raisin, but also bold raspberry and plum.

14629,Spain,"Tight and largely neutral white fruit aromas show a little apple but little more. The palate is friendly and easy, with melon as the lead flavor. Turns more citrusy and weighty on the finish, which fades fast.",Viña do Campo,86,18,Galicia,Ribeiro,NA,White Blend,Bodegas Docampo
14633,Spain,"One of the best $7 wines you'll find from Spain. The nose is bright, medicinal and floral, while the palate is loud and peppy, with sweet red fruit flavors that sport a candied coating.

14658,Spain,"A leader in user-friendly Monastrell from Jumilla is Luzón. Altos is the winery's high-expression baby, and if you like a bruiser with char, toast, coffee and other nocturnal characteristics, then look no further.

14662,Spain,"Dark, ripe and handsome. Those are the basics on this showy wine. Aromas of leather, shoe polish and char darken up the berry fruit, while flavors of blackberry and plum vie with oak-based mocha. Plenty of length and potential on the finish, but also some hard oak that needs more time to get absorbed. Best in 2009–2010.",Esculle de Solabal,91,62,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Solabal
14663,Spain,"Light in color with aromas of finely scented bath soap, strawberry, fresh cream and steel.

14702,Spain,"Raisin and heavy plum aromas suggest full ripeness and even some overripeness. It feels chewy and textured, with serious concentration and baked flavors of dark berry and roasted plum.

14736,Spain,"Stolid and compact on the nose, with generic berry aromas. The plate has a tannic stickiness to it, while the flavors veer toward jammy blackberry.

14751,Spain,"Rich, saturated and dark, with initial aromas of game and salsa and then more typical raspberry and plum.

14859,Spain,"One of the best efforts we've tried from Jumilla, Luzon's luxury blend starts with coconut, mint, char and fudge, and below that is a treasure trove of deep black fruit.

14861,Spain,"This younger-vines mix of Garnacha, Carignan, Cab Sauvignon and Syrah is very attractive and loaded with graphite, schisty mineral and black cherry aromas.

14881,Spain,"Full, roasted and earthy on the nose, with only some coconut and berry aromas to sweeten things up.

15032,Spain,"You want color and heft? You get that here, and more.

15040,Spain,"From a brutally hot vintage, this shows plenty of mineral, schist and cola aromas along with impeccably smooth fruit. It's a little racy and sheer in the mouth, but food will balance that without a problem.

It's bold and packed with blackberry, pepper and other spices. It's the perfect wine to enjoy with barbecue, stews and roasts.

As big, baked and heavy as they come, with gargantuan tannins. Includes 15% Syrah in addition to Monastrell.",Cármine,85,30,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Bodegas Murtia
15744,Spain,"Smells sort of gummy and candied, with aromas of red licorice stick, raisin and raspberry jam. The palate is sizable but comes with racy acidity, thus the flavors veer toward red fruits with an herbal accent. Burns a little on the finish due to sharp acids.",Cantos de Valpiedra,85,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Finca Valpiedra
15747,Spain,"Lightly stemmy and brambly, with lean red fruit aromas, a touch of saline and red licorice candy. The palate is lean and sort of scratchy, while the flavors are suggestive of red apple skins and red plum. Tight on the finish; similar is some ways to a simple Chianti.",Crianza,85,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Rioja Vega
15749,Spain,"This is the prototype for an over-the-top, roasted, charred Tempranillo. The nose smells directly of burnt coffee, charcoal and grilled beef. It's super-chunky on the tongue, with dominating roasted black fruit flavors. It has its merits but is still too blackened for our liking.",NA,85,20,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo,Tritón
15783,Spain,"Gritty on the nose, this has baked bean, mushroom, roasted plum and earth aromas. It feels blocky and tannic, with some cushion to the palate. Oaky tasting, with prune, vanilla and buttery notes that settle on baked fruit and chocolate. It comes on forceful and heavy and is arguably a little overripe.",Reserva,89,80,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Resalte
15807,Spain,"From a good vintage like 2009, this modest Tinta de Toro has a lot to offer. It smells slightly rustic but full of fruit.

It's peppery and lightly herbal on the finish.",Tinta de Toro,89,15,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Cermeño
15870,Spain,"Big and yellow, which is evidence of the oak aging on this plump, modern Verdejo that's made in small quantity and will appeal to those who like things such as Sémillon and Chenin Blanc. The body is full, there's fruit, weight and grip, and the ripeness versus minerality is just right. Drink now with cheese or fish. 300 cases produced.",Naiades,89,28,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Naia
15883,Spain,"Dry, smoky and lightly fruity, this Pinot Noir-based Cava is about as good as it gets in the price range.

15963,Spain,"Inviting aromas of tobacco, earth, cedar and bacon give weight to racy berry scents. It's stripped and tight as a drum on the palate, with fiery acidity creating tangy raspberry and plum flavors accented by notes of tobacco, wood spice and citrus.

15982,Spain,"A bit scratchy, leathery and herbal on the bouquet, but there's also a stony character and raspberry aromas.

The finish is long and lightly oaky.",Heredad Candela,88,25,Levante,Yecla,NA,Monastrell,Barahonda
15985,Spain,"This opens with sweet, compact aromas of raisin and spice. It feels more perky and crisp in the mouth, with a slight acidic cut and flavors of roasted berry, herb and chocolate. The finish is lightly herbal and minty, with peppery spice and plenty of length. A classic Bordeaux blend of roughly one-third each of Cabernet, Merlot and Cabernet Franc.",NA,88,19,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Aljibes
16053,Spain,"Spicy and savory smelling, with interesting aromas that encompass maple, chili powder, smoked meat and mildly baked berries.

16068,Spain,"If you don't mind some heavy barrel char, then you'll probably like this rough rider.

16073,Spain,"Not often do you come across an aged Valdepeñas red, especially one with style, structure and character.

16075,Spain,"Scala Dei seems to have managed 2003's tough conditions, and this is endowed with sweet Garnacha-driven aromas that touch up against raisiny but don't cross the line.

16199,Spain,"Lightly spiced up front, with cinnamon and nutmeg aromas adding complex sweetness to cherry and cassis scents.

16246,Spain,"Plenty of intense new oak sets the nose in a direction toward mint, licorice and black pepper. And that's all good, because the palate backs it up  with prime blackberry and cassis flavors. This is a solid wine with slightly pronounced acids and tannins. Not for those averse to a little grab and kick.",Prios Maximus Crianza,88,26,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas de los Rios Prieto
16251,Spain,"Nicely balanced and a better example of the upside of Navarra than the wines that are based on or include Merlot. The nose shows some herbal character but more deep fruit notes. And in the mouth there's ripe cherry, cassis and plum. Texturally, it's very nice, and when you get down to the nuts and olts it's a very good value.",NA,88,11,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon-Tempranillo,Vega Sindoa
16257,Spain,"Carchelo is at its best in this vintage. This is loaded with wild blackberry and leathery sass, too.

16361,Spain,"Roasted and rustic up front, with bricky, oaky berry aromas. This is tight and ripped across the palate, with hickory, maple and bacon flavors.

16400,Spain,"Rarely do you find musclebound, intense reds priced at $8 that are this good. But Luzon manages to give you a 65/35 blend of Monastrell and Syrah that is lively, loaded and eminently likable. It's all about hefty black fruit, bold tannins and flash. Only 5,000 cases made.",NA,88,8,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Luzón
16404,Spain,"Brutal heat didn't do a lot for Mas La Plana in 2003. While still a worthy wine, this one shows some green on the nose and palate, while the balance is weightier than normal. In its favor, there's bold blackberry and a touch of cola on the palate. Good but not up to the wine's usual high standards.",Mas La Plana,88,50,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon,Torres
16501,Spain,"Blackberry, tobacco and balsamic aromas lean slightly towards vinegar, and there's a distinct tangy quality to the palate.

16530,Spain,"Generally speaking, this is a respectable Priorat from a tough year. The nose is berry packed, while the flavors run toward toast-covered raspberry.

16691,Spain,"There's not much difference between this wine and the label's less expensive Brandal. This is a bit richer, with chunky melon aromas and peach melba flavors. But it may suffer a bit from additional ripeness and lower acidity. For best results, get at it fast.",NA,87,25,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Adegas D'Altamira
16699,Spain,"A little weighty, with ripe apple and peach aromas. Fairly succulent in the mouth, with apple and citrus flavors that are both sweet and a touch chewy.

16708,Spain,"Heat from the 2003 vintage aside, this is one sweet, forward, dark-colored Cava. The nose is all about cheeky, sweet fruit, while the palate offers more berry sweetness along with vanilla. Normally this bottling is more restrained and striated, but 2003 was a warm year.

16830,Spain,"Nothing wrong with this pleasant, friendly Cava. The nose boasts frosted breakfast cereal and lemon curd, while the palate is defined by spiced apple and baked citrus.

16848,Spain,"Classic in every sense, from the early aromas of dill butter to the dry, acid-driven palate to the light, crisp finish.

So if you're looking for an old-school Spanish red to go with tortilla espanola or lamb chops, this will do the trick.",Old Vines Reserva,87,17,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Navarro López
16859,Spain,"Light and floral on the nose, and medium in intensity and acidity. Flavors of apple, green melon and citrus are clean and crisp, and overall the wine is a model of freshness.

16931,Spain,"This is toasty and overflowing with wild berry and cassis aromas. The palate is tight and tannic, with salty berry fruit flavors that seem wild and untamed.

16999,Spain,"No doubt this wine possesses peppery, herbal qualities. But before it's dismissed as green we'd like to note that there's also a nice savory side to it.

17005,Spain,"Plump, melony and ripe on the nose, with creamy pear, melon and banana flavors.

17534,Spain,"The melon and pineapple aromas are pure and carry a waxy edge. It feels simple and well comported, with green apple, pear and vanilla flavors. This is tasty, smooth, lively and classy; drink right away.",NA,87,10,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo-Sauvignon Blanc,Prado Rey
17541,Spain,"Pink in color, this has fresh, clean aromas of stone fruits. Feels medium to full, with red licorice, sweet baking-spice and raspberry flavors. Quick, round and solid on the finish, which lingers for quite some time. A fine summer sipper.",NA,87,9,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Rosé,Marqués de Cáceres
17542,Spain,"Concentrated and sweet, with aromas of raisin and cassis that lead onto an intense, syrupy palate, with salty berry, brown sugar and fudge flavors. This is deep as a country well, with a ton of flavor. But truth be told, it's tannic as can be, with a crushing mouthfeel that makes food mandatory.",Single Vineyard Estate Bottled,87,40,Central Spain,Dominio de Valdepusa,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon,Marques de Griñon
17591,Spain,"Bring on the funk, at least at first. This new-to-America wine gets out of the gate with wild leather, stable and bramble aromas, and there's always an aggressive, untamed quality to it. But with air it settles, and eventually true Tempranillo flavors emerge. More challenging than it should be.",Spiga,85,30,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,O. Fournier
17605,Spain,"The nose deals perfume, sawdust and even some fruit, while tobacco, cassis and blackberry flavors are adequate if not overly impressive. More interesting than some in its class, with a few flaws along with virtues.",Azagador Viñedos Propios Crianza,84,13,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Pago de la Jaraba
17608,Spain,"Leafy and minty up front, with jumpy fruit that runs toward tomato and pepper. It's a rugged little wine with hot and spicy oak notes along with some dill and burnt coffee. Not offensive but not exactly regal.",Reserva,84,16,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,Condesa de Leganza
17687,Spain,"Floral, with berry aromas, it's also quite charred and oaky, with mocha. It feels weighty despite displaying prickly acidity, and there's a resiny feel to the palate as well. The flavors of baking spice, chocolate and blackberry run aside barrel-driven flavors. This is a big, oaky Garnacha.",Tres Picos,87,17,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Borsao
17744,Spain,"Vanilla and dill aromas are front and center. The palate imparts plum skin and red-apple flavors, with lots of rough tannins holding the feel hostage. There just isn't a lot of meat on the bones, so it comes across like a mouth full of hardware. Imported by Luneau USA Inc.",Reserva,84,15,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Condado de Oriza
17745,Spain,"Ripe, warm and spicy on the nose, with standard red berry aromas and flavors. The mix is Tempranillo, Cab and Syrah, which is unusual. Yet the wine tastes perfectly open and familiar, as if you've had it and enjoyed it before. Nothing special but it's good and fruity.",Oristan Crianza,84,10,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Lozano
17759,Spain,"An older wine with more oak than jazzy fruit, so the aromas are heavy with the scent of cinnamon and the palate is more drying and spicy than it is rich and rewarding. Still, with the right food you may be able to appreciate the wine's smoke and vanilla qualities.",Crianza,84,26,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Gotin
17763,Spain,"This barrel-fermented Verdejo is interesting, but it's also a bit low on acidity. It smells like pine and blowsy flowers. Creamy, soft and cuddly on the palate, this has flavors of baked apple, wood resin and banana. It finishes round and sweet. Drink now.",Collection Blanco,87,25,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Loess
17766,Spain,"Stalky and grassy smelling, which is par for a Penedès white blend. There str also apple and lemon-lime notes on the nose. In the mouth, it's lively and spritzy in feel, with pineapple, lime and grassy flavors. Zesty, dry and minerally on the finish, this should pair well with seafood and paella.",Blanc Selecció,87,15,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,White Blend,Huguet de Can Feixes
17773,Spain,"Peppy, clean black-fruit aromas come with a touch of leather. It feels full and juicy, with a firm texture and bright, lightly toasted flavors of plum and berry. This is an uncomplicated wine, the perfect quaffer for the price.",Lobetia Made with Organic Grapes,87,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Dominio de Punctum
17785,Spain,"The briary, red fruit aromas are slightly prickly slightly, becoming fuller and deeper with time in glass. This feels solid and fairly dense for the price, with berry, peppery spice and light herb flavors. Fruity and friendly on the finish.",Luzon Verde,87,9,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Bodegas Luzón
17820,Spain,"Navarran Merlot often leans toward the vegetal. There's bell pepper and tomato on the nose, but also balancing red plum, cherry and raspberry on the palate. It's a touch sheer, scratchy and green, but the effort is there and by no means is it a bad, herbaceous wine.",NA,84,12,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Merlot,Vega Sindoa
17825,Spain,"Raspberry and strawberry aromas offer a reasonably good opening, backed by sweet strawberry and vanilla flavors. A bit sticky and candied, but overall it's friendly and round enough to make the grade.",de Los Infantes Roble,84,10,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,NA,Tempranillo,Alba
17842,Spain,"Quite heavy; in fact, a touch too much. The nose is defined by corn and apple cider, while the palate is heavy and melony, with a lot of unbounded sweetness and softness. Needs more overt acidity and citrus to achieve proper balance.",NA,83,11,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Aldor
17849,Spain,"Interesting in that this fresh, snappy table wine includes 60% Airen (a white grape) in addition to Tempranillo.

17854,Spain,"This opens softly, with murky aromas of tomato and prune. It feels heavy and dense, with big tannins and mild acidity.

17865,Spain,"This is stewy smelling, with tomato leaf and raisiny notes. It feels dense and mature, with mild acidity creating jammy raspberry and plum flavors along with a lot of barrel spice. The oak flavor is dominant on the finish.",Deyo,86,18,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Merlot,Castillo de Monjardin
17912,Spain,"Rather dilute and basic, with a touch of buttercup to the sweet, mellow nose. In the mouth there's almond skin, melon and mild citrus flavors, while the finish is fresh enough despite being fleshy. Simple but fine; drink immediately.",Vega Esteban Blanco,83,8,Central Spain,Ribera del Guadiana,NA,Viura,Bodegas Ventura De Vega
17922,Spain,"In no way is this up to the high standards of other Tirants. The 2003 is overly woody and shy on the rich, saturated fruit that it's supposed to deliver. It's O.K., but very leafy, dry and tight.",Tirant,83,87,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Rotllan Torra
17929,Spain,"First, second and third nosings all result in the same finding: that this Cava smells a lot like lettuce. In the mouth, scattered citrus and apple flavors are acceptable, and while the mouthfeel is fine, it just doesn't hit the spot or trigger much excitement.",Brut,83,13,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Torre Oria
17931,Spain,"The sweet, oddly spicy nose stirs some intrigue, and that's likely derived from the Grenache. Yet despite reasonably good flavors, it bounces along like a truck on a gravel road. It just doesn't have much balance, mouthfeel or charm.",Rojo Granrojo,83,9,Central Spain,Tierra de Castilla,NA,Garnacha,Bodegas Navarro López
17941,Spain,"This is appealing from the beginning, with fresh raspberry, strawberry and mineral aromas. It feels nice and bright, with flavors of citrus, pink grapefruit and green herb. Finishes with forward acidity and mild flavors of sage and tarragon.",Tempranillo-Shiraz,86,10,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Rosé,Storks' Tower
17946,Spain,"Earthy and dark, this has a lot of oak, herb and carob aromas. It feels full, tannic and grating, but also creamy due to copious oak.

It's very oaky and bulky, with Garnacha, Shiraz and Monastrell.",Unfiltered,86,20,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Red Blend,Papa Luna
17955,Spain,"The lime, mineral and flower aromas are inviting. On the palate, light, powdery flavors of lime, kiwi and green melon take over.

17963,Spain,"This has firm, ripe berry aromas that are a little roasted and woody.

17969,Spain,"Rubbery and gaseous smelling at first, with medicinal black-fruit aromas of blueberry and black plum. It feels syrupy and heavy, with roasted flavors of herb-tinged black fruit and mint. A full-bodied, forceful wine, with heat and herbal influences.",NA,86,30,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Pagos del Moncayo
18000,Spain,"Smells whole, so you're hopeful going in. But the palate is stark and rather raw, while the flavors of raspberry and cherry are limited. A palate slammer with harsh tannins.

18006,Spain,"Already past its prime, this Garnacha-based rosado has sweet nectarine aromas along with a sugary, creamy palate. If it had more zest upon release, that's mostly gone at this stage. Wait for the 2006.",Rosé,82,7,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Borsao
18008,Spain,"Campo de Borja can produce some strange wines, and at the head of the class would be this rooty, tomato-laden wine that's at one point sweet but then bland and cooked at the next. A varietal Garnacha from a hot vintage that just isn't worth the price.",NA,82,43,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Alto Moncayo
18013,Spain,"Burnt and seemingly weedy at first, this heavily oaked 100% Garnacha is initially downright weird and baked. In the final analysis it's all wood and medicinal fruit. Not a personal favorite.",Veraton,82,22,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Alto Moncayo
18017,Spain,"Initial sweet-plum aromas are as good as it gets. Raisin enters the picture, and eventually you've got a  heavy, clumsy, overly ripe wine that tastes and smells mostly of sappy oak and coconut.",Number One,82,8,Central Spain,Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Berberana

18020,Spain,"No matter how you slice this up, it comes out smelling and tasting sharp and burnt. The nose is brambly and fiery, while the mouth is peppery and rough. Hard and jagged at every turn, thus you need the pan y arroz (bread and rice), to absorb the wine's kick.",Red,82,10,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Panarroz

18028,Spain,"This is over the hill and showing mostly vegetal papaya and green melon aromas and flavors. There's not much spunk or style left, so wait for the 2006 and drink that wine upon release; Fransola has never aged well.",Fransola,81,27,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Sauvignon Blanc,Torres
18047,Spain,"Red plum, rubber and leathery aromas lead to a dry, medium-full palate, with peppery spice and red fruit flavors.

18053,Spain,"Ripe but basic on the nose, this has dusty apple and sweet, minerally notes that are not sugary.

18521,Spain,"Floral and fruity smelling, this also has notes of dry earth and asphalt. It feels tangy and tomatoey, with saucy flavors of red cherry, tomato and herbs. The finish is herbal, with flavors of oregano and rosemary amplified by zingy acidity.",Duque de Medina Tinto,83,10,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Garnacha,Ignacio Marín
18522,Spain,"With aromas of milk-chocolate-covered cherries and forced oak, this smells overtly sweet and candied. This feels choppy and juicy, with red fruit flavors and buttery oak in the background. It turns sweeter and more buttery on the finish, but doesn't offer much complexity.",Reserva Old Vine,83,15,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Grenache Blend,Gabarda
18524,Spain,"A funky, lean wine that's all over the place. The nose is fiery, with cardamom and notes of sweet peppers and candied berries.

18525,Spain,"Stemmy, earthy aromas of cherry and hard spice lead to a rough palate with hard cherry and berry flavors. It blackens up on a pounding finish; this is edgy and rough stuff.",Crianza,82,12,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,NA,Tempranillo,Marques de Moral
18531,Spain,Mild raspberry and tomato aromas precede a grabby-feeling wine with sandpaper tannins and flavors of medicinal plum and tomato. It comes across loud but raw and unrefined.,Crianza,82,10,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Albali
18532,Spain,"This is rubbery smelling, with distinct whiffs of leather and grilled meat. Sheer, tangy and acidic, this has a burnt, gritty flavor that blends with cherry and tart plum. It's minty and somewhat dilute on the finish.",Vinya Laia,82,17,Catalonia,Catalunya,NA,Red Blend,Albet I Noya
18534,Spain,"Aromas of white pepper and nettle are about as fresh as it gets. The rest is falling off, with bitterness and oxidation. Acceptable but bland and bitter on the tail end.",Valdeleña,82,15,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Verdejo,Bodega Melgarajo
18535,Spain,"Stalky aromas give off the impression of corn and funk. It feels ultrasnappy, with medicinal fruit, forced oak and berry flavors that don't really click. The finish is grating and slightly bitter.",Rojo Granrojo,82,9,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Navarro López
18538,Spain,"This smells flat and stewy, with jammy sweetness and little punch. Conversely, it's pointy on the palate, with tart, generic red-berry flavors and warmth on the finish.

18602,Spain,"A touch of vinegar and volatility sits atop the nose, but there's fruit and weight under the surface. It feels tannic and slightly sour, with sharp acidity pushing zesty flavors of tomato, red cherry, red plum and herbs. Tasted twice with inconsistent results; this note reflects both wines that were tried.",Premium,82,12,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Castillo Colina

The nose offers bold berry, roasted plum, vanilla and spice aromas along with exceptional clarity, and the palate is snappy and pure but also dark and loaded with coffee, chocolate, mocha and fine raspberry and cherry flavors.

19863,Spain,"Aromas of bold black cherry, leather, bacon and sandalwood scream “modern,” yet its age renders it a bit classical.

19987,Spain,"Meaty, earthy and dark, with a powerful consitution along with briar and sharpness. In the mouth, it's a touchy customer with biting tannins, but as it unfolds you get a dark palate of black fruit, coffee, chocolate and spice.

20057,Spain,"Intriguing but expensive sweet wine, with leather and dried cheese aromas as well as dusty, rubbery black fruits and licorice.

20470,Spain,"There are few points of reference for this hugely intense sweet Monastrell. It's deep and purple, with concentrated, fresh raisin aromas, licorice and berry syrup. Entirely rich and unctuous, with caramel, toffee and reduced berry flavors.

20527,Spain,"Light, elegant and hinting at lemon-lime on the bouquet. The mouth is mellow, complete and not the least bit aggressive, with peach and melon flavors that turn drier and mildly pithy on the finish. Well-executed and elegant cava, but simple in its totality because it's brut nature.",Leopardi Brut Nature,89,29,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Llopart
20543,Spain,"Not on a par with the inaugural 2007, but for a rough year this wine brings about as much as it can. The nose is woody, deep, balsamic and herbal, while the body is thick and saturated, with roasted berry, coffee and bitter chocolate flavors. The finish lacks length and character, but it has heft and feel. A commendable effort for a poor vintage.",Almirez,89,30,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Teso La Monja
20581,Spain,"Stocky and kind of big on the bouquet, with broad, fat berry fruit aromas and some jamminess. The palate is saturated and jammy, with thick blackberry flavors and roasted fig.

20668,Spain,"Raisin and other sweet, soft aromas are friendly but don't really bring it. The palate follows suit; it's chubby and jammy, with sweet berry flavors, a touch of raisin and a roasted, candied finish. Very nice and true to the region, albeit on the soft and easy side.",NA,88,20,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Heredad Soliterra
20726,Spain,"Just sweet and soft enough to temper the wine's more citric, minerally side. Aromas of green pear and melon are basic and welcoming, while the snappy, forward palate is cleansing and fresh. Flavors of green melon, apple, saline and honey scream Rías Baixas.",Peitán,88,15,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Nora
20764,Spain,"Not a lot of glaring aromas of a sweet wine here; in fact, it's showing fresh tomato, cherry and more dryness on the nose than candy or syrup. The palate is tight and a little clipped, with sweet cassis and reduced black plum flavors. Short on the finish, but good and grabby overall.",Ètim Varema Tardana Negre,88,27,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Grenache,Agricola Falset-Marca
20781,Spain,"Big, chunky and dark on the nose, but smells monotone except for a floral hint.

A good restaurant wine, either by the glass or bottle.",Finca La Cuesta,88,22,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Red Blend,Luna Beberide
20782,Spain,"Marqués de Cáceres intentionally lowered the amount of new oak on this barrel-fermented Viura, and the result is positive. The nose is smooth and slightly creamy, but not oaky or resiny smelling. Composed and balanced across the tongue, with orange, lime, nectarine and toasty flavors. Quite good for barrel-fermented white Rioja.",Antea,88,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Marqués de Cáceres
20784,Spain,"Opens with mossy aromas that are soon replaced by foresty oak and murky black-fruit notes. The palate has enough thickness and concentration to register as true Toro, while the flavors of berry fruit, herbs and spice cover the bases. Oaky and lightly tannic on the finish, and just beefy and chewy enough.",Prima,88,24,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Maurodos
20823,Spain,"The best Paso a Paso white yet; it's ripe and smells of pineapple and melon, while the palate is pure and has a solid feel. Flavors of apple, peach and pithy citrus are honest, and the finish is clean. Delivers what it should and more.",NA,88,10,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Verdejo,Paso a Paso
20837,Spain,"More up the ladder from Vitoria's crianza, but also more raisiny and oaky. The wine develops nicely with air, shedding raisin for more of the fruit spectrum. Meanwhile, the oak is strong and obvious, leaving vanilla, toast and spice on the finish. Otherwise, it has the same flavor profile and acidic kick as the crianza. Drink now through 2013.",Reserva,88,27,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marqués de Vitoria
20851,Spain,"Quite ripe and dark, with blackberry, raisin and aromas of woody spice manifested as cinnamon.

A powerful, deep style of crianza with a lot of oak.",Crianza,88,25,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Cruz de Alba
20852,Spain,"A little rusty in color and somewhat transparent, with raisin as the key aroma. There's not a lot going on in the mouth, but the wine is mellow and deep, with sweet flavors of molasses, berry syrup and baked black fruits. Rich and candied, but rather sweet and a touch dull for Priorat. Drink now.",Montgarnatx,88,45,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Francesc Sanchez Bas
20922,Spain,"Very friendly and clean cava with good fruit and a pinch of aromatic toast. It's far from out of the ordinary, but it is extremely fresh and clean, with pure lemon-lime and green apple on the palate. Finishes fruity and with finesse. Really good in an uncomplicated way.",Marrugat Brut,88,13,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Pinord
20930,Spain,"Beefy, stocky aromas also bring herb, tomato and berry notes. The palate is jumpy and slightly medicinal, with currant, tomato, herb and plum flavors running the show. Medium in size, with level tannins and a juicy, good overall feel to it.",Baltos,87,17,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Dominio de Tares
20938,Spain,"Leafy, roasted and herbal up front, with modest ripe-fruit aromas sitting below. The palate smacks down hard with tannin and acidity, while the flavors are leafy, herbal and suggest raspberry and cherry.

20975,Spain,"A bit mulchy but also displaying power and quality for an under-$10 wine. The nose is initially murky but evolves toward sweet, simple berry fruit.

Slightly big and rubbery but convincing as a whole.",Val Montium,87,9,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Bodegas Adriá
20976,Spain,"Satisfying from the purple color to the sweet bouquet to the clean palate to the long finish. It's a little simple and syrupy, but overall there's plenty of freshening acidity and flavors of plum, berry and chocolate to make it a complete and balanced wine. And that's really all you should hope for in this price category.",Luzon Verde Organic Grapes,87,9,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Bodegas Luzón
20977,Spain,"Rubbery and roasted, but not too much so. Otherwise one should look for medicinal berry aromas followed by flavors of baked plum, prune and black pepper. The finish is dense, a touch flat, and chocolaty; overall this is a chunky, sweet performer.",NA,87,8,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Bodegas Tarima
20996,Spain,"One of the most cutting, acid-intense Albariños out there. The nose in minerally and tight as a drum, with green melon and green apple scents. The palate is razor sharp and driving, with tangy, high-toned lemon and Granny Smith apple flavors. Totally citric and zesty; it will last another few years.",NA,87,26,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Palacio de Fefiñanes
20999,Spain,"Clean and inviting, but simple, with apple and fresh-herb aromas. The palate is properly crisp yet not sharp, and the flavors of green apple and white grapes are snappy. Regular and a little better than good in every way, but ultimately more basic than special.",Brut,87,15,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Mont Paral
21058,Spain,"Dark, smoky, heavily oaked and resiny, with aromas of char, leather and burnt toast.

Modern and creamy, with enough quality fruit to back things up.",NA,87,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Obalo
21101,Spain,"Fiery to start, with spice and herbal fruit aromas. The palate is juicy, lively and healthy in feel, with berry, plum and spice flavors.

21106,Spain,"Yellow-gold in color, with baked fruit, butterscotch, creamed corn and wood resin aromas. Forcefully oaked and massive in the mouth, with enough sporty acidity to prop up the woodspice, nutmeg and resiny flavors that render the fruit secondary.

21110,Spain,"Opens with rubber, smoke, leather and coffee aromas, then the fruit comes in on the palate, which is juicy and correct, with tight, fresh red-fruit flavors and notes of ripe tomato and pepper flake.

Juicy but short and searing.",Ecològic,87,41,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Genium Celler
21290,Spain,"Aromas of pineapple, grapefruit, juniper berry and dust are slightly sharp but do manage to fold together into a solid whole.

21331,Spain,"Fairly pungent, with apple and lemon aromas that are typical for the variety. The palate has an edge to it and jacked-up acidity that pushes citrus and pineapple flavors toward tangy. With so much citrus character and acidity, it's lasting and scouring.",Limited Release,87,15,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Vionta
21339,Spain,"A solid rendition of Verdejo with apple and pear aromas along with basic minerality. The palate is standard and firm, with good acidity pushing apple and citrus flavors. Perfectly competent but not showing the nuances and higher qualities that would justify a $17 outlay.",NA,86,17,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Verdejo,El Pensador
21355,Spain,"Basic and a little sweet and confected, but consider the price and you should be smiling. There's some bramble and pepper to the nose, but mostly it's just ripe and full of blackberry and black plum character. Candied and almost cloying, but remains flush and happy. Good in the midlevel category.",NA,86,8,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Wrongo Dongo

21414,Spain,"Spiced berry aromas are dense and suggest raisin, but overall this is a clean, inexpensive blend of Garnacha and Tempranillo that is satisfying and highly competent. Flavors run smoky, rubbery and dark, but not baked or too heavy. Toasty and roasty on the finish, too.",NA,86,8,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Red Blend,Don Ramón
21475,Spain,"Dark and rubbery on the nose, but also lightly leafy and herbal, with oak and coffee for cover up. The palate is good but slightly rough and narrow, and the flavors are not as deep and developed as they have been in the past. Plum, berry and herbal flavors are good but lead to a short, modest finish. Vintage 2008 was not a good one, and this wine reflects that.",NA,86,28,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Elias Mora
21516,Spain,"Rubbery and a little gaseous on first pass, with medicinal berry emerging later on the nose.

21525,Spain,"Opens with aromas of burnt leaves, roasted bell pepper and tomato and finally secondary red fruit. The palate is saturated but hard, with herbal, leafy, dry red-fruit flavors and a backing of cured meat. Herbal late, with some old-school cherry and tobacco.

Comes up a bit short and hollow on the finish, but good all totaled.",Garnacha-Tempranillo,85,12,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Red Blend,Ochoa
21638,Spain,"Opens with burnt, rubbery aromas that eventually cede to asphalt, roasted peanut and leather. The palate is soft and a bit hollow in the middle, with earthy, rubbery flavors of black plum and berry. Finishes with cola, bitter coffee and root beer flavors. Decent and full overall, but rubbery.",Gotín del Risc,85,14,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Red Blend,Abad
21657,Spain,"For a sweet wine, it's clean, light and airy, with pear and powdered sugar on the nose. The flavors are definitely sweet but the feel isn't particularly sticky, and the finishing flavors of candied fruit, vanilla and honeydew are good. Made from late-harvest Viura and Malvasia.",Satinela Medium Sweet,85,9,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Marqués de Cáceres
21695,Spain,"Slightly minty and grassy on the nose, and that mild green character persists. The palate is a bit clacky and acidic, yet the flavors evolve and ultimately rest at candied and medicinal. A touch biting but it tastes pretty good and it's decidedly not sour. A blend of 55% Monastrell with 25% Cabernet Savuignon and 20% Syrah.",NA,85,10,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Caracol Serrano
21703,Spain,"Mildy green tobacco aromas lead the way along with forest floor, fern notes and standard berry aromas. The palate opens with forceful acidity, while the flavors are a bit underdeveloped as they lean toward blackberry. Mild bitterness is also part of the picture as the wine flattens out on the back side.",Dama de Toro,85,13,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Fariña
21705,Spain,"Earthy and rubbery on the nose, and rather dark for a $10 Rioja. The palate is jammy and solid, with berry flavors, a hint of toast and heat. The finish is somewhat burning, but overall it's a legit blend of Tempranillo and Garnacha that fits the “value” mold.",Solnia,85,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Red Blend,Ilurce
21717,Spain,"A simple and snappy style of Rioja with just enough weight and ripeness along with light berry aromas. The palate is perky and fresh, with young, medicinal, semisharp flavors of cherry and plum. More than competent, with verve and acidic scour.",Ursa Maior,85,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Ondarre
21753,Spain,"Medicinal, sweet and short on complexity for a wine of this price. The palate has a choppy, rough feel and then comes an onslaught of medicinal berry flavor that leads to a tight, biting finish that's big on acid and low on depth of flavor and intracacies you might expect for $80. More of a novelty wine; 160 cases made.",Valdemuz,85,80,Northern Spain,Tierra de León,NA,Prieto Picudo,Pricum
21792,Spain,"Richer and more grapey than the Valdorramiro 2008, but also friendlier, deeper and more complete. Aromas of blackberry, vanilla and sweet spices lead to a structured, weighty palate full of spicy, oak-driven berry and plum flavors. Clove notes and length define the finish. Drink from 2014–2019",Malleolus de Sanchomartin,93,183,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto Fino,Emilio Moro
21807,Spain,"Raspberry, cranberry, schist and wild brush aromas are about as correct for Priorat as you'll find. In the mouth, this wine from Sara Pérez and René Barbier Jr. is lively, racy and pure, with red berry, vanilla, coconut and tobacco flavors. Finishes long and elegant. Drink through 2016; 166 cases made.",Partida Bellvisos,92,130,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Gratallops
21823,Spain,"Neutral on the nose, and then crisp but bland tasting. There's apple and green hints of fresh bell pepper and lettuce, while the finish shows lime, citrus pith and mild bitterness. Light and basic; made from 50% each of Airen and Macabeo (Viura).",White Wine Made With Organic Grapes,84,10,Levante,Alicante,NA,White Blend,Vermador
21828,Spain,"Lemony and citrusy from the get-go, with floral notes to the nose. The palate is sheering and tart, with edgy tannins. As a whole, it's angular, with tomato and red-fruit flavors. A natural, jacked-up example of Prieto Picudo that's a bit underwhelming.",Paraje de El Santo,84,69,Northern Spain,Tierra de León,NA,Prieto Picudo,Pricum
21833,Spain,"Dry, minty and spicy, with cool, lightweight berry and cola aromas. The palate is fairly light and easy, with lean red-fruit flavors, dry spice and a creamy tasting accent. Spice more than fruit carries the finish. Pedestrian wine that's competent.","Tempranillo, Garnacha, Mazuelo",84,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Baron de Escal
21834,Spain,"Earthy and mildly medicinal smelling, with a healthy, not too stark palate that's dealing pointed cherry flavors and some dry oak. It's a touch sharp and angular, with a dry, peppery finish that's lean, acid-driven and starching.",Otoñal,84,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Olarra
21837,Spain,"Smells oily, stemmy and a bit funky, while the palate is sweet in the extra dry mold, with candied white-fruit, vanilla and powdered sugar flavors. The finish is warm and sweet, with a fast fade. More candied and sweet than fruity or exact.",Aria Estate Extra Dry,84,14,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
21872,Spain,"Quiet and shy on the nose, with generic white-fruit notes. For a medium-dry white, it offers requisite sweetness along with soft fruit notes, candied flavors and a green, lightly vegetal accent. A bit spritzy but not that lively or precise.",Fuente Milano,84,13,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Verdejo,Bodegas Escorihuela
21873,Spain,"Grassy on the nose, and for a brut nature this is decidedly flat in aromas, with ultradry flavors of lime and tangerine along with powdery vanilla. Super light on the finish, which dissipates in no time. Almost tart and lacking in the long run.",Brut Nature,84,18,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Miquel Pons
21875,Spain,"Blowsy and mustardy, like it's starting to turn south. The palate is loud, jumbled and heavy, with mustardy orange flavors, a touch of flowery honey and then bitterness. Big and powerful, but not very poised.",NA,84,17,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Robalino
21886,Spain,"Tanning in color, with stalky, semimealy aromas that lack zap and citric crispness. The body is heavy, although there's adequate acidity, while the flavors lean toward mealy citrus and ripe melon. Pithy and bitter on the finish, like almond skins.",Old Vines,83,12,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Macabeo,Yasa
21889,Spain,"Sweet and funky smelling, with a weird set of aromas that suggest Middle Eastern spice and hard-to-gauge fruit. The palate feel is barely acceptable, while the flavors are jumbled and overtly spicy and strange. Maybe it's the oak? Or maybe it's just not very good wine.",Crianza,83,NA,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Qumrán
21940,Spain,"A passionfruit-dominated wine without much else besides a fresh, almost watery palate feel. This is a one-trick pony that's all passionfruit except for some pineapple juice and mango sorbet. Wet, zesty and tropical but only moderately pleasant.",Vivanco Viura-Malvasía,83,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Viura,Dinastía Vivanco
21943,Spain,"Roasted, rubbery primary aromas turn herbal, while the palate is classic Navarran in that it's tomatoey, with herbal cherry flavors and a leafy juniper character. Simple and short late, with a slightly sour, herbal finish.",Abril de Azul y Garanza,83,12,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Azul y Garanza
21947,Spain,"Based on experience, Zumaya's wines just aren't at the high level that Ribera del Duero is known for. This is herbal and foxy, with roasted, leafy aromas leading to an underwhelming palate of tomato, stewed red fruit and vanilla. Saucy on the finish, and ultimately okay but not up to par.",Crianza,83,22,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Zumaya
21974,Spain,"Serious wine for serious Ribera lovers, even if it's from a generally weak vintage. Smells of bacon grease, graphite and dark berry fruits. Feels tight and youthfully tannic, with hickory, smoked meat, clove, toast and blackberry flavors. Clove and spice rest heavily on the woody finish; needs time to evolve and absorb its oak treatment. Best from 2013–2018.",Malleolus de Valderramiro,92,212,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto Fino,Emilio Moro
21978,Spain,"Dark as night, with charcoal, campfire, sweet berry and jammy notes to the alluring bouquet. Lively on the palate, with tangy acidity propelling black fruit, sweet oak, licorice and spice flavors. Solid, well built and generally smooth. Excellent Ribera from a very good year. Drink through 2019.",Corimbo I,92,63,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas La Horra
21998,Spain,"Candied cherry and raspberry aromas are anything but complex or serious, while the palate is lean, sheering, crisp and more tart than flavorful. Scouring on the finish, and not really offering much of anything.",NA,82,9,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Rioja Vega
22005,Spain,"Heavy and mealy on the nose, with stalky white-fruit aromas. The palate is weighty and sticky, with a cloying feel and sweet, baked flavors of apple and honey. Then it turns distinctly bitter and pithy on the finish. Generally speaking, Calatayud is not white wine country.",NA,82,11,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Macabeo,Tres Ojos
22010,Spain,"Smells like tarmac and tire rubber initially, and it remains stemmy and staunch even with air. The feel is dilute yet edgy, and the flavors suggest generic red berry and a dash of spice. Fades quickly on the finish, which is probably a good thing.",Vendimia Seleccionada,82,9,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Conde de Jauregui
22028,Spain,"Hard and crusty on first impression, with smoky, leathery, meaty aromas along with hints of wild herbs and dark berry fruit. Feels racy and ultraslick, with cherry, plum and mineral flavors. Hits all the right notes while not pushing any buttons too hard or too often; long on the finish. Drink now through 2014.",Clos Abella,91,68,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Marco Abella
22058,Spain,"Smells strange, with a mix of unknown spice and odd fruit aromas. The palate is snappy and sharp, with light fruit and oaky, resiny flavors that leave a lasting, confounding aftertaste. Rather pointless given all the good value-priced wines on the market.",Juan de Valdelana,81,11,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Valdelana
22061,Spain,"Roasted, herbal and blunt, with an acrid stemminess. The palate lacks ripeness and elegance as it delivers burnt, leafy, herbal flavors. Underwhelming.",NA,80,13,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Vega Murillo
22094,Spain,"Nutty as they come, with a dose of honey on the bouquet. Tastes extremely nice and powerful, with cleansing acids and complex flavors of salted peanuts, almond, baked peaches and toffee. Layered in terms of feel and delivery, with a nutty, crisp finish.",Prestige 50 Palo Cortado Viejísimo,91,125,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Pedro Romero
22144,Spain,"A unique and individual style of Sherry, even among palo cortados. It's dark amber in color, with a pungent mix of aromas that include molasses, raw brown sugar, chocolate and campfire. Feels fresh on the tongue, with coffee, dark chocolate and core peach and citrus flavors.",Apostoles Palo Cortado Viejo,91,49,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,González Byass
22150,Spain,"Light in color, with pecan pie aromas. There's nothing heavy or blowsy about this refined palo cortado; it's tight in the mouth, with narrowing acidity and tangy, oily flavors of citrus, almond and rancio. Long as they come on the finish, with zero excess weight.",Marqués de Rodil Palo Cortado,91,42,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Hidalgo
22164,Spain,"After it oozes rubber and bacon on the nose, berry fruit and mild medicinal aromas settle in. Feels full, tight and structured, with meat, black cherry and wild berry flavors. Finishes warm, chocolaty and lightly roasted. Well-made, and impressive for the price.",Crianza,91,20,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Martín Berdugo
22167,Spain,"Full, lusty and slightly floral smelling, with notes of leather, crusty berry and hoisin sauce. Feels thick, with body and weight along with flavors of berry, cookie dough and floral hints. Long, meaty and slightly herbal on the finish, with just enough complexity to nudge it ahead. Drink now through 2015.",Crianza,90,34,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Convento Oreja
22203,Spain,"Toasty and sweet on the nose, however it's not very complex. Feels juicy and refined, with raisin, fig and date flavors. Long on the finish and chocolaty tasting, with raisin and a lightness of being. Sweet within the style, but not unctuous or candied.",Solera Cream,90,29,Andalucia,Montilla-Moriles,NA,Pedro Ximénez,Alvear
22224,Spain,"Round and welcoming up front, with toffee, caramel and mocha aromas that are not too sharp.

22264,Spain,"For affordable amontillado, this is downright excellent. Smells nutty and oily, maybe a touch sharp, but well within normal parameters. Feels fresh, round and comfortable, with lots of core fruit flavor, nuttiness, sweet toffee and caramel. Finishes with toasted pecan flavors and peanut butter notes. Semidry in style.",Amontillado,90,15,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L.
22267,Spain,"Packed tight with power and minty, earthy berry aromas that come with a dry dustiness.

22269,Spain,"Good berry aromas form a nice opening, and there are solid spice and herbal notes to boot. Feels juicy, well-cut and tighter than in years past, with blackberry, tea, spice and cured meat flavors. Oaky on the back side, but complex and showing potential. Hold through 2013, then drink.",Malleolus,90,73,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto Fino,Emilio Moro

22449,Spain,"Aromas of pencil shavings, marzipan and jammy berry are sweet and slightly candied.

23425,Spain,"Good for the style, which is sweet and lightly bubbly. Smells melony, then feels fresh and lively in the mouth.

But there's also a smooth intersection of the old and new worlds here; it's one part rooty, oaky and rich but also dry, leathery and indigenous to the Balearics (the base grape is Callet). Finishes a little sweet and warm, and thus it's begging to be drunk now.",Àn,89,50,Spanish Islands,Vi de la Terra Illes Balears,NA,Red Blend,Ànima Negra
24887,Spain,"A more traditional type of crianza with vanilla, spice, dry berry fruit and a quiet, subtle approach.

24968,Spain,"Ripe, with a slightly baked persona turns more jammy with airing.

24982,Spain,"Fairly rubbery and smoky on the nose, with hickory aromas vying with blueberry and plum notes. Feels good and full, with sweet berry flavors and plenty of oak.

In golfing terms, it splits the fairway; it's perfectly good and should generate no complaints.",Reserva,88,18,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Montecillo
25050,Spain,"Floral fruit aromas suggest blueberry, but overall this vintage lacks the power and depth that Termes and its big brothers are known for. Airing sets up sweet, easygoing berry flavors and full tannins, but in the middle it's less whole than it has been in other years. A juicy, well-made wine that should not be judged as weak just because 2007 was a marginal vintage. Drink now through 2013.",Termes,89,30,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Numanthia

25151,Spain,"An opening of apricot and peach aromas is proper, while the palate delivers a jolt of zest and acidity to more pineapple, lime and punchy green-apple flavors. Tangy later on, with more than a drop of lemon and lime to the finish. Also slightly pithy and bitter, which is natural for Godello.",NA,88,18,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Godello,Abad Dom Bueno
25156,Spain,"Minerality and crispness define the bouquet, which brings green apple and citrus aromas. There's punch and spritz on the palate as well as sweet citrus and juicy lime flavors that break up a little as they fan out. Not sure if there's residual sugar, but the wine tastes a bit sweet.",NA,88,16,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Lícia
25169,Spain,"Shy at first, with standard raspberry aromas, earth and buttery notes along with cherry and raspberry flavors. Becomes fuller and more satisfying with time, and once it's fully open you have a solid, satisfying Rioja with true flavors and good overall balance.",Crianza,88,14,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Castillo Labastida
25175,Spain,"Opens with a load of sweet, candied black-fruit aromas but this wine excels on the nose because it's composed and precise for being so young and simple in scope. Velvety, rich black-cherry flavors run the show, and the finish brings length and an herbal shading. Very nice for a wine from Toro at this price.",Dama de Toro,88,11,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Fariña
25181,Spain,"Comes out of the chute with some aggression, but that's settled by quality apple and grassy aromas. The palate is jumpy and lively, with pleasant, slightly sweet apple and peach flavors. Shows good refinement, ample layering of flavors and a spot of minerality. As a whole, this is good cava.",Brut,88,17,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Montsarra
25185,Spain,"This is a smooth, subdued style of Rioja that's perfect for tapas or casual consumption. The nose offers the right kind of entry: cherry and raspberry with dusty spice. And the flavors are friendly and suggest black fruits and smoke. A little more oaky and charred than some, but a nice crianza nonetheless.",Crianza,88,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Ramón Bilbao
25187,Spain,"Dusty lemon and cidery aromas are solid and draw you in. The palate has a fresh, clean feel and lively, tangy flavors of citrus, green fruits and green herbs. Zesty, a bit lemony, and nice on the finish. Not a complicated bubbly by any means.",Brut Reserva,88,14,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Sonim
25195,Spain,"Dark and fully oaked Rioja with vanilla, mocha, char and black-fruit aromas. The body is good while the acidity is a bit high, and thus the flavors lean toward tart black cherry and zesty wild blackberry all with a robust amount of toast, spice and charred darkness.",Crianza,88,19,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Obalo
25219,Spain,"Solid on the nose, with pure berry aromas matched by oak-related vanilla. Fresh and medium in weight, with juicy acidity and mild tannins. Tastes of dried red fruits, blackberry, vanilla and tobacco. Fairly long and slightly elegant on the finish. Drink now through 2014.",Crianza,88,25,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,Viña Arnáiz
25230,Spain,"Brickish in color, with mature aromas of cedar, pine, tobacco, olive and dried fruits. There's still some racy acidity that's keeping the rooty flavors of tobacco, dried berry, coffee and spice moving forward. Finishes dry and a little bit classic; drink now for an affordable taste of Navarra.",Crianza,88,14,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Castillo de Monjardin
25235,Spain,"Crisp and minerally up front, with aromas of apple, peach and dust. It's fresh, maybe a touch basic at its core, with flavors of apple cider, apricot and almond skins. There's nothing not to like about this Albariño, which is pure, pithy on the finish, and more than solid in a pedestrian, familiar sort of way.",Single Vineyard,88,18,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Finca de Arantei
25240,Spain,"Smooth on the nose, with a pinch of rubber, earth, smoked beef and plum/prune. The palate offers structure, solid acidity, zestiness and bright flavors of cherry and raspberry. Finishes crisp and tight, with lingering vanilla. A nice wine for tapas and other meat-based dishes.",Reserva,88,18,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Ondarre
25241,Spain,"While I prefer the 2009 for its clarity and freshness, this '08 is no slouching tiger. The nose delivers still-fresh apple and mineral aromas, while the flavor profile leans toward gooseberry, lemon and green melon. Shows some pithy bitterness on the finish, so drink right away or seek out the '09.",NA,88,19,Northern Spain,Valdeorras,NA,Godello,Gaba do Xil
25253,Spain,"Mineral, lime and crisp apple aromas give it a precise, pure nose. And that same character exists on the palate and finish, where white peach, green banana and melon flavors are full and forward. Shows good concentration and quality for a large-production bubbly at this price.",Aria Estate Brut,88,14,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
25261,Spain,"Smells clean as a mountain stream, with apple, peach and mellow citric aromas. Shows medium intensity and controlled citrusy acids along with grapefruit, pineapple and passion fruit flavors that come largely from the 20% Sauvignon Blanc in the blend; the rest is 70% Chardonnay and 10% the local Picapoll grape. Interesting, and a very good Catalonian white wine to match with seafood.",Abadal Chardonnay-Sauvignon Blanc-Picapoll,88,19,Catalonia,Pla de Bages,NA,White Blend,Masies d'Avinyo
25283,Spain,"Sweet, jammy and a touch raisiny on the bouquet, with a roasted quality summing things up. Feels more acidic than expected, with zest and juiciness pushing flavors of blackberry mixed with tobacco and vanilla. Finishes herbal and oaky, but ripe and ready.",Inspiración Valdemar,87,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Valdemar
25286,Spain,"Opens with waxy, sweet aromas of yellow apples and honey. Feels good, round and balanced, with Golden Delicious apple flavors sweetened by honey drippings and melon.

Good for varietal Xarel-lo.",XA Vinyes Velles Made with Organic Grapes,87,NA,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Xarel-lo,Albet I Noya
25292,Spain,"Starts out a little gaseous and sulfuric, but it picks up steam in the mouth, where flavors of apricot, citrus and tropical fruits perform a likeable dance. Powerful acidity pushes it in the right direction, and the finish of lychee, passion fruit and nectarine is lasting. Very nice wine but relatively high in price.",NA,88,25,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Mar de Frades
25302,Spain,"Stylistically, this is at odds with what I feel Albariño should be. That said, it's a well-executed and well-made barrel-fermented white with full-force toast and popcorn aromas followed by a resiny, vanilla-fueled flavor profile that folds in apple, banana and creamy frosting. Still vital and healthy after three years in bottle.",Nora da Neve,88,29,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Nora
25310,Spain,"For Navarran Merlot-Cab, Inurrieta Norte is always a winner. This vintage has good darkness along with smooth aromas of black fruit, earth, rubber and spice. It's a bit acidic and shrill as a tasting wine but will do fine at the table. The mouth is spunky and shows slightly herbal raspberry and plum flavors. Finishes light and easy.",Norte,87,15,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Inurrieta
25311,Spain,"For a rosado cava, this offers nice fruit, balance and complexity. The nose is pure cherry and raspberry, but in subdued doses. Meanwhile, it's zesty, foamy and fresh in the mouth, with nectarine, plum, strawberry and prickle. Perfectly nice for everyday quaffing.",Cordon Rosado Brut,87,12,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet

25374,Spain,"A perfectly solid Garnacha with pepper, bright red fruit and a touch of country style to the bouquet despite its pedestrian price.

What inexpensive red wine should be.",NA,87,7,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Crucillon
25412,Spain,"Tight on the nose but also a bit oxidized and yeasty smelling. Feels more tangy and juicy than Alvear's Fino en Rama, with forward acidity, bite and cut. Flavorwise, there's a heavy dose of nuts, apricot and citrus followed by a zesty finish.",Fino,87,15,Andalucia,Montilla-Moriles,NA,Pedro Ximénez,Alvear
25442,Spain,"Clear and focused, with raspberry and edgy spice aromas to the nose. The palate doesn't bring a whole bunch of meat or heft, but it is clean, racy and food-friendly.

25444,Spain,"Lime, citrus and other pungent aromas get it off to a good start, while the palate is wet and fresh, with clean, familiar grapefruit, lime and nectarine flavors. Lighter and less concentrated than Naia, but still a very good Verdejo for the price.",Ducado de Altan,87,13,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Naia
25457,Spain,"Dry and subtle on the nose, with cherry and plum fruit scents mixed with balsam wood.

25459,Spain,"Timid but clean as a whistle on the nose, with apple and vanilla aromas along with a sprinkling of talcum powder.

25463,Spain,"Dry and peppery to start, with muted berry fruit aromas along with wood shavings. The palate is snappy, clean and juicy, with raspberry, vanilla and tobacco-like flavors.

25470,Spain,"Neutral aromas suggest peach, apple and minerality. Solid, compact and healthy on the palate, with peach and white pepper flavors.

25473,Spain,"Pinched smelling at first, with a note of turpentine. Airing eliminates that burn, leaving standard nut and vanilla aromas.

Finishes long and fresh.",Tio Pepe Fino Muy Seco,87,18,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Palomino,González Byass
25498,Spain,"Starts out somewhat fiery, with a dose of aromatic horseradish. After airing out, this varietal Tempranillo is fresh, juicy and crisp on the tongue, with flavors of baking spices, tomato, roasted plum and earth. Feels juicy on the finish, maybe a bit lean, and overall it's cut from the classic cloth.",Reserva,87,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Bujanda
25505,Spain,"This vintage rosado is as good as always, but a bit lower on the quality ladder than previous years.

Smooth and easygoing, with sweet, generic flavors of orange and berry.",Reserva Brut Rosé,87,22,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Llopart
25508,Spain,"Normally this producer's high-end Sherries are outstanding, but this Amontillado is aggressive and hard, with a clod-like character that starts with molasses on the nose and then turns toward sharpness and bitterness on the palate. Try as I might, this one strikes me as good but loud, hard, forceful and lacking the suavity that great Sherries possess.",Del Duque Amontillado Muy Viejo,87,45,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,González Byass
25510,Spain,"This is your quintessential simple quaff among brut cavas. It's clean, lime-tinged and soda-like on the nose, with a correct, no-issues palate that pushes zesty apple along with sweet papaya, mango and banana flavors.

25512,Spain,"Slightly low on kick and bubbles for a blanc de blancs, but the wine's mix of green herb, apple, green banana and melon flavors is good and offers the proper set up to a finish that's citrusy as can be and only slightly pithy. Seems a touch flat or it might have rated even higher.",Brut Blanc de Blancs,87,18,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Paul Cheneau
25514,Spain,"Dusty, slightly candied aromas are briary and pretty good, and overall it's giving freshness, pop and red-fruit flavors touched up by dill, nutmeg and vanilla.

25517,Spain,"Starts out with roasted, stewy, beefy aromas and not much brightness. The palate is measured and healthy, with dry raspberry, currant and medicinal plum flavors.

In a nutshell, it's a good, standard, respectable Rioja that will complement almost any food.",Reserva,87,26,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Solabal
25520,Spain,"A heavy, slightly strained wine that has a lot in tow. The nose is smoky, rubbery like an inner tube, and a bit herbal. In the mouth, it's a wide load with sweet, sugary, baked flavors of blackberry, prune, fig and chocolate. Very much on the ripe side, with a full tannic bite.",Lanzaga,87,34,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Telmo Rodríguez
25522,Spain,"Initially it's rugged, but airing reveals black-cherry aromas and dry spice. The palate is crisp and a little sheer by itself, but the call here is that with food it'll be a winner. Flavors of red fruits are dry and collected, while the finish blends in coffee, spice and a touch of herbal Navarran panache.",Crianza,87,15,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Marco Real
25525,Spain,"Good on the nose, with solid raspberry and nectarine aromas. The palate is spunky and alert, with juicy red-cherry, rhubarb and integrated spice flavors. It's mostly a clean, basic, easy-to-drink bubbly, but it's persistent, harmonious and commendable.

25527,Spain,"Aromas of apple cider and mild spice get it going in a good direction, and this colorfully packaged cava does pretty well in the mouth, where the texture is on the soft side and the flavors of apple and orange run a bit sweet. Not complex but good, fluffy and yeasty.",Lady of Spain Brut,87,15,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Paul Cheneau
25541,Spain,"Clean, fresh and full of bright cherry and strawberry aromas. Offers the right size and balance, with red plum and red berry flavors touched up by light oak. Mildy toasty and textured on the finish.",Serres Tempranillo,87,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Carlos Serres
25568,Spain,"A touch raisiny and sweet from nose to tail, but what's in between is convincing for Jumilla.

25576,Spain,"For Spanish Chardonnay, this is perfectly good and clean. The nose brings your basic set of white-fruit, mineral and fresh herb flavors, while the palate is lively despite some dry, resiny oak flavor. Even with banana, vanilla and creamy flavors, the wine is decidedly not cloying.",NA,87,14,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Chardonnay,Vega Sindoa
25582,Spain,"This winery is known for red Mencía, but this small-lot Godello is perfectly nice and drinkable. It has a neutral nose and a fresh palate of green melon, nectarine and apple flavors.

25587,Spain,"Dusty earth and dry spice aromas blend with some char, vanilla and berry/cherry on the nose.

25666,Spain,"After an aromatic opening that includes wet leather, rubber and brine, this wine finds its stride, and while it's firmly tannic, the flavors of dark fruits, tomato, herbs, tobacco and cured meats do the trick. It gets better the longer it sits; drink now but give it as much air as possible.",NA,87,32,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,Convento San Francisco
25681,Spain,"Fresh and full of lime on the nose, and overall this is simple, smooth and gives you little reason to worry or fuss.

25755,Spain,"Lucid and basically colorless, with flowery, lychee-like aromas that suggest Malvasia or Moscatel.

25767,Spain,"A bit unusual and confusing, but that's because it hails from the Rioja region. The nose is herbal and mustardy, with green aromas leading to a cidery palate of apples and spice.

25773,Spain,"Seems as though this medium-sweet Viura-Malvasia blend has gotten better in recent years as the winery has dialed down the sweetness and weight.

25840,Spain,"Opaque in color, with blackberry and licorice aromas but also a distinct streak of brambly herbs and green. Later on, pine needle and tartness enter the fray.

25881,Spain,"Unusual in that this cava hails from the Ribera del Duero region, where red wines are 99.9% of the show.

26057,Spain,"Hot earth, baked cherry and mild vanilla aromas come in front of a snappy, angular palate with tangy pie-cherry and red-plum flavors. Sheer and basic Rioja with high acidity, lean fruit, a cleansing finish and a light body.",Crianza,84,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Montecillo
26062,Spain,"Smells oily and a little burnt and acrid, with fleshy flavors of banana, melon and bitter pith. Has some verve but mostly it's an average wine with some bitterness and dry orange peel and pith. Decent but offers nothing beyond.",Hermanos Lurton,84,13,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,J. & F. Lurton
26063,Spain,"Lively, candied and medicinal, with grassy aromas along with mild animal notes. The palate is young, grabby, forceful but solid, while the flavors are bright, bold, snappy and suggest red plum and black cherry. A basic young wine that's decent if you're not too discerning.",Viñas de Olivara,84,9,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Marqués de Olivara
26074,Spain,Plum and blueberry aromas come with a hint of green herbs. Feels fresh and clamps down with good tannins in the mouth before unleashing dark plum along with toast and peppery spice flavors. Juicy on the finish.,Made with Organic Grapes,86,10,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,Paso a Paso
26087,Spain,"Earthy berry aromas come with rubbery notes, tobacco and bramble. The feel is scratchy but lively, with flavors of lean red fruits, dry oak and milk chocolate. Oaky on the finish, with some heat. Needs food to help it along.",Crianza,85,18,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Dinastía Vivanco
26110,Spain,"A bit flat and jammy on the nose, and then it runs hot and heavy across the palate, where the flavors waver between citric and plum-cherry. There's a lot of fruit here, but also some burn and finally a dull hum to the finish.",NA,84,9,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Tienen Duende
26118,Spain,"Earthy but sharp on the nose, with a foreboding sense of stem and sourness. The palate is indeed raw and acidic, with lean, slightly stemmy flavors of herbs, raspberry and plum. Not bad but carries a stemmy, less-than-pure personality.",Reserva,84,14,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Campo Viejo
26128,Spain,"A rubbery, minty, jammy wine, with a mildly candied, gummy feel and sweet, modest, lightly green flavors that suggest red fruits. The finish is decent but herbal and sweet.",Viña Main,84,14,Central Spain,Vinos de Madrid,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Orusco
26159,Spain,"Bramble and red berry aromas are attractive and almost exotic. Feels a bit furry and scratchy, but tastes of blueberry with an herbal tinge. Finishes well, with a pinch of minty green flavor.",NA,85,7,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,Venta Morales
26164,Spain,"A bit tan and dull to the eye, with neutral aromas of apple cider and peach. The palate is wet, uncomplicated and simple, with basic apple flavors that some might consider to be bland. Solid on the finish, with papaya for flavor.",NA,84,8,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Viura-Chardonnay,Vega Sindoa
26194,Spain,"Starts out murky, gassy and challenged, and while it does emerge from that cloud it remains little more than bargain-priced, borderline Tempranillo from an obscure central Spain region. The palate shows generic, herbal black fruit and the finish is acceptable.",Mesta,83,7,Central Spain,Uclés,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Fontana
26198,Spain,"Bright and shimmers with purple, while the nose is jumpy and candied, with a lot of sweetness and black fruit. Marginal to tough on the palate, with racy, hard tannins and a clacky feel to go with wild berry and mulchy flavors. Tasted twice with consistent notes.",Tempranillo,83,11,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Condado de Oriza
26203,Spain,"Generally speaking, most Amontillados are good at their worst, but for whatever reason this wine barely makes the grade. It lacks pop on the nose and seems dilute and drab. In the mouth, the flavors strike as sour and sharp, but also musty and weak. With so many fine Sherries available, this one seems like a laggard.",Viña AB Amontillado Seco,83,18,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Palomino,González Byass
26217,Spain,"Strawberry and rhubarb aromas get it going, and frankly that's about as good as it gets. The mouthfeel is so-so. but the flavors are funky and mealy, with a weedy bitterness that doesn't serve the wine well. Lacks purity, focus and persistence. Made from Pinot Noir.",Aria Brut,82,14,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Pinot Noir,Segura Viudas
26218,Spain,"A strange bird with herbaceous aromas that suggest sage or juniper baking in the summer sun. The palate is acidic and sharp, with green-tinged pie cherry and plum skin flavors. Gritty on the finish, with needling tannins and a final wave of that odd juniper character. 60% Monastell and 40% Petit Verdot.",Crianza,82,16,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Casa de la Ermita
26220,Spain,Molten black-cherry aromas are followed by a tight but limited palate with hard tannins and hard-driving black-fruit flavors that turn quickly to pepper and ultimately a slight bitterness.

26235,Spain,"Shows dark fruit aromas and raisin on the nose, feels fresh, zesty and edgy, with a bright mix of cherry, berry and mild spice flavors. Feels pretty good and offers a reasonably solid and long finish for a $6 red.",Opera Prima,85,6,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,J. Garcia Carrion
26237,Spain,"Opens with peachy, citric and saline aromas. Feels moderately fresh, but seems as though it's starting to mature as it's fleshy and pithy.

26266,Spain,"Bouncy, jumpy, candied aromas come with scratchiness and minty green. Feels tangy and bordering on sheer, with zesty flavors of red berry fruits, citrus and herbs. Mild and not too deep on the finish.",Tinto,85,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Bujanda
26268,Spain,"Minerally on the bouquet, with apple and oceanic notes. Turns citric and acidic on the palate, with pineapple, orange and tangy flavors. Shows astringency on the finish, but at least it's juicy and driving.",NA,85,25,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Zarate
26280,Spain,"Gold in color and short on bubbles, but heavy on sweetness and residual sugar. That said, it's an advertised semidry, so a certain level of cloy is expected. But this tips too far to the sweet side, leaving nothing but refined white sugar, banana and vanilla cream. Not my cup of tea.",Carta Nevada Semi Dry,82,9,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
26281,Spain,"Reddish in color and devoid of a visible bubble bead, this Garnacha-Monastrell cava is lacking in many ways. The nose is grassy and ashy, sort of like a spent cigar, and it's cheesy as well. In the mouth, it's fairly bland tasting, with generic, semitart flavors and a sharp finish.",Artesanía Brut Rosado,82,13,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Cavas Hill
26285,Spain,"A fairly unclean wine with leafy cough-drop aromas. The palate is weak and washed out, with stemmy red-fruit flavors. Spiced and leafy on the finish.",Joven,81,6,Spain Other,Spain,NA,Red Blend,Viña do Val
26289,Spain,"Stemmy and raw smelling; similar in the mouth. The palate is narrow and sheer, while the flavors lean toward tart red cherry and rhubarb. Peppery and underwhelming.",Tempranillo,81,8,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Albali
26325,Spain,"Tight, citric and minerally up front, with less-than-expressive white fruit aromas. Extremely high in acidity, which is why this wine is still kicking.

26330,Spain,"Aromas of lemon blossom, apple and melon are friendly enough, and the palate has a clean, lifted feel.

26334,Spain,"A bit scratchy up front, with some heat and rubber to the bouquet. Feels bold, grippy and alive, with lightly herbal flavors of roasted berry and leather. Herbal and blackened on the finish; ripe but basic in quality.",Mesta,84,8,Central Spain,Uclés,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Fontana

26372,Spain,"Jumpy and funky on the nose, with a lack of cohesion and a scent of wet dog. Feels grabby but lacks concentration; tastes herbal and mildly candied, with a scratchy and sweet tasting finish. Good but doesn't stand up to scrutiny.",Single Vineyard Crianza,84,17,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Finca El Encinal
26383,Spain,"Peach, melon and light oceanic aromas. Feels a bit flat, with slightly bitter flavors of almond skin and pithy citrus. Picks up steam on the finish courtesy of lasting acidity.",Zios,84,15,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Lusco
26388,Spain,"Smells decidedly burnt and stalky, with rubbery berry and black plum aromas. Shows grip on the palate, along with the same flavors hinted at on the nose: leather, burnt coffee, herbs and roasted berries. Feels pretty good, but the stalky, burnt core dominates.",Crianza,84,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Bujanda
26442,Spain,"Roasted, oaky and creamy smelling, with baked berry aromas. Conversely, it's rather edgy and citric in the mouth, with plum, citrus and tomato flvors accented by dill weed. Ends in herbal fashion, with crisp acidity.",Vendimia Seleccionada Crianza,84,17,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Muriel
26491,Spain,"On the plus side, the wine is exotic and different, with blueberry, herbal notes, juniper and roasted aromas. But in the mouth, it's lean to the point of being thin, with sharp acidity and tight red plum, pie cherry and herbal flavors. Short on the finish, with tang and scour.",Miros de Ribera Crianza,84,27,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Peñafiel

26518,Spain,"Stalky and reedy smelling, with a touch of cherry and plum to the bouquet. There's not much to the palate other than mild citrus and red plum fruit, while the finish is little more than zesty. A fresh quaff.",Monte Clavijo,83,9,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Criadores de Rioja

26559,Spain,"Baked and raisiny smelling, with kirsch. In a word, it's stewy. Ditto for the mouthfeel, which is chunky and heavy. Features thick black plum, herb and carob flavors and feels beefy on the finish.",Monte Real Crianza,83,17,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Riojanas
26641,Spain,"Grassy and green on the nose, and then lean, light and crisp in the mouth. Tastes brambly and herbal, with a thin finish. O.K. but not really rewarding.",Roble,82,20,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,La Mano

27178,Spain,"Aromas of citrus, especially white grapefruit and lime, are spunky and sweaty like Sauvignon Blanc or Verdejo. A solid, fleshy palate is home to a mix of citric and tropical flavors, while the finish reverts back to grapefruit, with a monotone feel. This is Macabeo, Garnacha Blanca and Pedro Ximénez.",Òlbia,88,95,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,White Blend,Marco Abella
27227,Spain,"Cedar, tobacco and berry aromas are more general than specific. The palate is on the heavy side, with grabby tannins. Flavors of roasted berry fruits and cocoa finish dense, steady and with depth.

27238,Spain,"Dry, leathery and earthy up front, this mature Mencía is all about grip and complexity. In the mouth, it's tight and tannic.

27243,Spain,"Oaky aromas of almond, vanilla and peach settle on a palate with grip and acidity. Flavors of toasted almond, baked apple and briny apricot finish with forward acidity.

27252,Spain,"Aromas of brick dust, vitamins and baked fruits are gritty and require some navigating. This has a wiry, tight feel, yet in terms of flavors, it's ripe almost to the point of being raisiny. Heat, hard tannins and dried berry fruit flavors direct the finish.

27422,Spain,"Grassy, flat aromas are inoffensive but don't bring much to the table. This feels citrusy and foamy, with generic flavors of brown sugar and melon.

27430,Spain,"Stone-fruit aromas are the opening, and they're on the full, waxy, fleshy side. This weighs in with low acidity, and that results in broad flavors of papaya and green melon.

27533,Spain,"Smoky oak and hickory aromas are gaseous early on but come with ripe notes of raisin and plum. This Tempranillo-led blend feels round and grabby, but a touch hollow.

27536,Spain,"Earthy aromas of brick dust blend with spiced cherry and tomato notes. A chewy, solid palate registers as correct, while this tastes of ripe, candied berry fruits and chocolate. A long, warm, slightly oaky finish sends this on its way.",Crianza,88,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Siglo

35703,Spain,"Roasted and rubbery smelling, this has heavy oak influence that yields notes of mint and shoe. Shearing on the palate despite its body, this has flavors of oak-based vanilla, mint and sweet-and-sour plum.

36853,Spain,"Radiator dust, lees and vanilla cookie aromas precede a chunky flat palate. Flavors of lime, melon and apple are as basic as it gets, while the finish is bland except for a hint of pithy bitterness.",Hoya De Cadenas Brut Nature,85,11,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Macabeo,Vicente Gandia
36871,Spain,"Given the difficulties of this cool vintage, this is an excellent wine with dark berry, herb, spice and vanilla aromas. It's firm on the palate like most 2008s, with flavors of blackberry, chocolate and oak spice leading to an earthy tasting finish. Drink now–2016.",Cenit Old Vines,90,59,Northern Spain,Tierra del Viños de Zamora,NA,Tempranillo,Viñas del Cenit
36873,Spain,"Teso la Monja picked a good vintage to introduce this entry-level Toro. Romanico is big and candied on the nose, with floral berry aromas, milk chocolate and a touch of raisin. On the palate, spunky berry fruit flavors blend with juniper notes, while the finish delivers herbal leftovers, a pinch more juniper and commendable length and smoothness.",Romanico,90,17,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Teso La Monja
36887,Spain,"This has a lot of good things going in its favor, for example depth, power and richness. It's also raisiny and oaky, with stewy core flavors of baked berry, cassis, roasted meat and vanilla. The finish is chewy and thick, with vanilla and pastry flavors along with grating tannins. By no means is this wine perfect, but it offers a lot of what's good about Toro; drink now.",La Calera,90,34,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Cyan
36931,Spain,"A nice, floral, medium-bodied Rioja that should not steer anyone wrong. The nose is harmonized and not overpowering, while the feel is good and easy and the flavors of berry, plum and mild chocolaty oak work well together. Holds its line on the finish as well.",Rioja Bordón Crianza,88,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Franco-Españolas
36937,Spain,"Broad, bold and buttery, with aromas of toasted white peach, flower blossom, vanilla and mild oxidation. The blend is 65% Viura with Malvasia and white Garnacha, and overall it's a round, stout, creamy wine with apple, vanilla and toasty, resiny flavors and finishing notes. A little heavy and sticky but nice for barrel-aged white Rioja.",Organza,88,29,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Sierra Cantabria
36946,Spain,"Floral lilac and plum aromas greet you, followed by a chunky, frothy palate with crisp core acidity and toasty flavors of baked cherry and caramel. Finishes smooth and long, with peppery notes and dryness.",Brut Reserva,88,16,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Pinot Noir,Marqués de Gelida
36992,Spain,"Rubbery but fresh smelling, with sharp acidity that creates big-time juiciness but also an angular feel. Tastes of zippy, tangy red fruits that are crisp and sizzle away. Gets a bit more deep and earthy on the finish.",Coronas,84,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Torres
37006,Spain,"Quite strange and funky smelling, with uncommon grass, floral, hickory and blueberry aromas. The palate feels fine but has a sweet, faux-weedy core flavor that's offset by candied berry flavors. Tastes of licorice and lactic creaminess on the finish.",Rojo Granrojo,83,9,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Bodegas Navarro López
37019,Spain,"Funky and smelling of pine and tarragon. That aromatic sharpness carries straight to the palate, where the feel is narrow and the flavors are short and tangy, with little to no big-time berry fruit. Simply an acceptable underperformer that's tough and sharp.",Barrica,83,19,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Finca La María
37143,Spain,"Stone-fruit and apple aromas grace a mild bouquet. This feels solid but generic, with chunky peach, citrus and pithy flavors. On the finish, this Verdejo becomes more waxy and heavy in feel.",NA,85,9,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Verdejo,Paso a Paso
37153,Spain,"Briny, leesy aromas are funky and sweaty, not clean and lean like most Txakoli. Snappy, citric and decidedly not spritzy, this tastes of lemon, underripe nectarine and tart green apple. A cleansing seltzer-like finish is the closing act.",NA,85,20,Northern Spain,Getariako Txakolina,NA,Hondarrabi Zuri,Gaintza
37159,Spain,"Aromas of raw oak, eucalyptus and gritty berry fruits are hot and leafy. This Tempranillo-based blend feels choppy with aggressive grating tannins.

37181,Spain,"This wine is fresh as can be, with loads of friendly black-fruit aromas upfront. The palate is juicy and bright, not the least bit hard or tannic, with huge flavors of berry fruits, baking spices, chocolate and even some bacon. This delivers a lot for the price.",Honoro Vera,89,9,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Garnacha,Bodegas Ateca
37193,Spain,"Tarry blackberry and plum aromas are good and lusty. This is a round, medium-bodied blend of Garnacha, Carignan and Syrah that's ripe but not overpowering. Flavors of berry and plum are red in nature and finish with spicy notes and a good feel.",NA,89,17,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Red Blend,Zerran
37195,Spain,"For Toro, this is earthy and slightly herbal as opposed to ripe and jammy. Aromas of mulch, leather and herbal berry lead into a firm, rocky palate with rooty flavors of burnt leaves, black fruits and oregano. A tight, compact finish with moderate flavors is a bit closed and hard.",NA,89,28,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Elias Mora
37233,Spain,"A bit earthy and leafy on the nose and palate, with lightweight strawberry and raspberry aromas and flavors. The wine has a clacky, almost metallic feel to it along with hints of tobacco and green bean. Vanilla and sweetness push the finish, which is also slightly green. Hails from Cádiz in southwestern Spain.",Finca Moncloa,87,35,Andalucia,Vino de la Tierra de Cádiz,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,González Byass

37255,Spain,"Pink meets orange in terms of hue, while the nose gives a nice blend of sweet and snappy berry and citrus.

Good wine for the money.",Protocolo,87,7,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Rosé,Dominio de Eguren
37257,Spain,"Sort of scratchy and generic on the nose, with reasonably fresh red fruit aromas.

Fairly juicy and fresh as a whole.",Crianza,87,14,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,El Circulo
37322,Spain,"Waxy, peachy aromas are less than fresh, and the palate follows that lead via soft, pithy flavors of orange and melon. Shows little grip or structure for Godello and the finish fails to bring it home with kick or pop. Already past its prime. Tasted twice.",Gotín del Risc,83,14,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Godello,Abad
37333,Spain,"Smells earthy, murky and a little raisiny, and then in the mouth it scratches with grating tannins in support of floral cherry and tart red fruit flavors. Finishes sort of hollow and sour; standard issue at best.",Viñas Viejas,83,18,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Milcampos
37387,Spain,"A fine Cava with easygoing white fruit aromas and a cushioned, full and round palate. Tastes rich and honeyed, with toasty, nutty, dry apple and pear flavors. Elegant and complex, with texture and style.",Gran Reserva Brut,91,50,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Juvé y Camps
37393,Spain,"A traditional style of Rioja with earthy, peppery, dry aromas in front of a healthy, lively palate.

37455,Spain,Dusty apple aromas come with a vanilla-like note of animal crackers.

Drink immediately or wait for a new vintage.,NA,85,18,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Martín Códax
37461,Spain,"This is smelling a bit oxidized and wayward. Spritzy in feel, this blend of 70% Albariño, 15% Loureira and 15% Treixadura tastes pithy and like citrus skins.

37466,Spain,"Waxy peach and apple aromas come with a leesy cookie-like component. This is 50% each Sauvignon Blanc and Garnacha Blanca, and it feels both plump and watery.

37480,Spain,"Exotic blueberry and fir tree aromas set up a jammy palate with soft tannins and flavors of blackberry, dark cherry, toast and a hint of burnt beef.

37485,Spain,"With a hint of rubber and asphalt, the bouquet on this value wine is generous and topped with blackberry and dark plum aromas.

37495,Spain,"Light peach, apricot and buttercup aromas are better at first but lose steam with airing.

37541,Spain,"Burnt rubber and a certain stemmy, roasted character is draped over the nose and palate. It has a decent, normal feel to it but the flavors of strawberry and raspberry are herbal and burnt. Tastes and smells rubbery and not fully clean.",Rojo Granrojo,82,9,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Navarro López
37548,Spain,"Mild lime and mineral aromas draw interest, but the wine's palate is medium spritzy and sour, with sharp, lemony flavors and a dilute feel.

37558,Spain,"Tan like cream soda, with a weird, faded bouquet of banana pudding and resiny oak. Soft and weakly structured except for lasting acidity, while it tastes like fermented apples and finishes on bitter walnut.

37569,Spain,"Like most base-level Garnachas, this one has a sweet, candied aromatic cover. But unlike many it has depth, purity and avoids boring, offensive sweetness.

37590,Spain,"This aged wine hits most of the right keys. It's sexy and racy on the bouquet, with tobacco, orange peel, rooty cherry and tree bark aromas.

Drink or hold.",Faustino I Gran Reserva,91,38,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Faustino
37594,Spain,"Here's yet another excellent wine from this modern-leaning Riojano producer. The nose is full of spice, tobacco and deep berry aromas.

37610,Spain,"This wine pushes the envelope on concentration and ripeness. It's full of prune, raisin and licorice on the nose, but also a lot of weight.

37762,Spain,"Leesy aromas of wheat and corn are low on fruit and general appeal. This feels regular at best.

For whatever reason, this is below prior benchmarks.",Reserva Heredad,84,25,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
37764,Spain,"An oily bouquet lacks freshness while smelling a bit oxidized and like mushrooms. This has a chunky palate with oxidized, somewhat bitter flavors of papaya and citrus fruits.

37772,Spain,"This big, dark, rubbery smelling Ribera wine is rugged and pushy, with mild volatility on the nose along with a whiff of spent coffee grinds. A clampy, bullish palate with rock-hard tannins sets up rubbery black-fruit flavors in front of a rough and tumble finish. Overall this is very good but hard and tannic.

37803,Spain,"Pungent and sweaty smelling on first blush, almost suggesting Verdejo or Sauvignon Blanc. It remains oily and nettled on the nose, with sharpness.

Potent for the variety.",NA,87,22,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Don Olegario
37812,Spain,"A little gritty and tough on the nose, with hard strawberry and kirsch aromas. The palate is voluminous and foamy, with flavors of burnt blood orange and grilled pink grapefruit.

38451,Spain,"Crisp, natural and lightly salinic on the nose, with medium weight, good freshness and solid peach and citrus flavors. This is a standard but nicely done Rioja rosé with a pithy finish and just the right edge to it. Drink liberally with appetizers and you shouldn't go wrong.",NA,87,9,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Rosé,Marqués de Cáceres
38456,Spain,"More basic and strained than prior wines from this producer. The nose is rubbery and cheesy at first, with leather and blackberry. Hard, tannic and acidic as well, and only a little softer with airing. Flavors are of snappy, tough cherry and berry, and the finish shows tannic bite. Could improve some with aging; now it's a tough go.",Ètim Old Vines,86,27,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Grenache,Agricola Falset-Marca
38459,Spain,"Kicks off with minty coconut aromas and prune, then a hint of creamy green. The palate shows proper acidity and tannin balance, so the framing for the wine's raspberry flavors is good. Grabby but fresh on the finish, with just enough grapey richness.",NA,86,12,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Garnacha,Finca Antigua
38573,Spain,"This is a great wine, from a vintage that wasn't great. The nose is smooth and rich, with raspberry, plum, fine oak and all the spice that comes with it. The palate feels fresh and healthy, with racy blackberry fruit tempered by creamy chocolate, vanilla and spice. Like most high-end wines from the Eguren family, this is right on the money. Drink now through 2018.",La Nieta,93,159,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Viñedos de Paganos
38641,Spain,"Reduced medicinal raspberry and cherry aromas are more like fruit juice than wine. This is choppy and off the mark in mouthfeel, while unfamiliar jumbled flavors of jammy red berry fruits finish tannic and green.",Conde de Valdemar Crianza,82,17,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Valdemar
38644,Spain,"This is an underripe stench bomb with pyrazines coming at you from every direction. The nose is like a bowl of cactus and nettle, while the palate is harsh. Flavors of bitter pithy grapefruit show all that can go wrong with this variety.",NA,82,14,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Valdelainos
38652,Spain,"Strange yeasty unfocused aromas are unclean. This is flat and spineless, with yeasty papaya flavors. A diluted, leesy finish confirms that it's not ready for prime time.",NA,80,8,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Chardonnay,Hawthorne Ridge
38654,Spain,"This is a heartbeat or two from being DOA. Tan in color with an oily heavy mouthfeel, this tastes oxidized and shows almost no pulse.",Halcon,80,13,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Verdejo,Vega de Tera
38679,Spain,"With full-force aromas of leather, blackberry and licorice, this Levante blend is an aggressive wine with a tight, acidic body and racy flavors of cherry and tart plum. It's forward and pushy, with rawness, plenty of acidity on the finish, and flavors that take on a dark character.",Sierva,88,27,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Carchelo
38681,Spain,"This is a big, modern, warm Garnacha with a lot of oak and vanilla on the bouquet as well as blackberry and cassis. It's jammy on the tongue, but there's enough acidity to keep the pulse up. Dark black cherry, berry and rubbery flavors are followed by end-notes of raisin, chocolate and vanilla.",Fauno Organic Grapes,88,40,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Garnacha,Casa Rojo
38687,Spain,"The bouquet on this Priorat is raisiny, with tobacco and schisty aromas. The palate is one part jumpy and another part stewy and clumsy, with baked berry flavors that come with a tangy citric edge. The finish is long, with tobacco, stewed fruit and hard tannins. Drink now through 2015.",7,88,35,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Pinord
38703,Spain,"It has taken a few years but Morlanda has reached a nice place with this wine. Look for ripeness and concentrated black fruit aromas, and then a ripe palate with herbal blackberry and chocolate. Smooth on the finish, with a tiny bit of burn. Drink now through 2014.",Criança,90,48,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Morlanda
38760,Spain,"Grapey and potent as Rioja crianzas go, with a medium-to-full-sized palate that's full of bright acidity and standard but solid berry fruit flavors. It's the slightest bit creamy and thick on the finish, but overall it's about as middle of the road as any wine on the market.",Crianza,86,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Finca Nueva
38766,Spain,"Very light in body, color and aromas. The nose is punchy and a bit sharp, and so is the palate, which offers crisp, bracing acids to highlight zesty, lean nectarine and tangerine flavors. Quite linear and citric, but experience with this wine says it shows best with food.",NA,86,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Rosé,Muga
38768,Spain,"Soda pop-like on the nose, with a clear reference to Sprite and 7Up. The palate is somewhat candied and simple, but it has good feel and the flavors of lemon-lime are likable. Mild on the finish, with flavors that extend from the lemon-lime bouquet and palate.",Brut,86,14,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Mistinguett
38773,Spain,"A chunky wine with compost, coffee and leather on the nose. The palate holds onto that chunkiness with clumsy flatness that goes with herbal plum and berry flavors. Airing allows it to unfold and find a better place, but always does it seem heavy and on the murky side.",Lealtanza Selección Especial Reserva,86,36,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Altanza
38775,Spain,"The opening of smoke, rubber and black cherry comes across as being dark and good. The palate holds form with lively cherry, plum and currant flavors and finally a medium-long, somewhat warm and meaty finish. Good for an everyday, no-frills Garnacha.",Viña Alarba Old Vines,86,10,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Grenache,Bodegas y Vinedos del Jalón
38779,Spain,"Starts out muddled and murky, and eventually settles on rich, raisiny and slightly stewed. Seeing that this is Toro, some overripeness is almost a given, and thus the black fruit and licorice flavors are expected. Finishes warm, toasty and short, with a candied hollowness.",Crianza,86,22,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tempranillo,Tardencuba
38782,Spain,"Piercing to start, with leathery, bacony and campfire aromas. Saturated, although healthy, if a bit hard and tannic. Flavors of bacon and clove are right up there with black fruit and syupy richness, and clove carries onto the finish. Needs time to breathe and unfold; 65% Garnacha and 35% Syrah.",Tinto Joven,86,17,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha-Syrah,Pagos del Moncayo
38789,Spain,"Opens with bright, popping cherry aromas that are straightforward, much like the rest of the show. The palate is regular and healthy in feel, with standard cherry and raspberry flavors. Finishes the slightest bit toasty and warm. Nice but basic Rioja.",Viña Zaco,86,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Bilbainas
38862,Spain,"Opens with smoky, toasty black fruit aromas that send a clear signal that this is prime stuff. The palate has a velvety, lush feel despite having big tannins, and the flavors of blackberry, cassis, fine herbs, coffee and toast scream modern, but in a melodious, clear voice. Long, deep and toasty on the finish. Drink now through 2017.",El Puntido,93,62,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Viñedos de Paganos
38863,Spain,"The Eguren family makes a handful of take-no-prisoners Riojas, and this is probably the best value among them. Earthy and deep; the roasted berry, ham and sweet vanilla aromas lead to a palate that's the picture of health and balance. The fruit character is outstanding as are nuances of tobacco, chocolate and spice. Drink from 2012–2020.",Colección Privada,93,52,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
38871,Spain,"A little more raisiny than expected, but that's offset by a brilliant floral streak and more dominant blackberry, blueberry and black plum flavors. Finishes with a mix of freshness, delicious prune fruit and chocolate. Tasted blind, like we do in almost all cases, this wine was easy to identify as Calvario; it has a uniqueness to its fruit. Drink now through 2018.",Calvario,93,150,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Finca Allende
38972,Spain,"Scratchy plum and raspberry aromas are fresh and forward, while the mouthfeel follows suit; it's juicy, with narrowing acidity and brightness. Flavors of raspberry, plum and cherry end zesty and long, with crisp acidity maintaining focus. This is a blend of Carignan (Mazuelo), Garnacha and Syrah.",NA,88,13,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Red Blend,Bula
38977,Spain,"With dry, spicy, leafy aromas, this is pure, varietal Maturana, a grape only a handful of Rioja wineries are using. This version is lively, big and spirited, with reedy, leafy, black-fruit flavors and a long, spicy, full-bodied finish.",Inspiración,88,45,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Maturana,Bodegas Valdemar
38990,Spain,"With a burnished gold tint, this oak-aged, mature Godello offers dry citrus aromas, hard spice and barrel notes. The palate is structured and holding its own, while oaky, oxidized flavors of orange and peach end with almond, wood resin and mature citrus flavors. Drink this interesting but unusual white now.",Herencia del Capricho,88,62,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Godello,Gancedo
38995,Spain,"The nose on this blend of Gewurztraminer and Macabeo defines neutral; it's clean but shows little more than a whiff of apple. The palate is fresh and quick moving, with mild peach, pear, apple and melon flavors that culminate in a solid finish that's not very exciting but doesn't stray.",Treyu,88,16,Northern Spain,Empordà,NA,White Blend,Oliver Conti
38999,Spain,"With damp earth and crusty leather aromas, this is a heavy wine with baked fruit, a syrupy mouthfeel and flavors of mocha, carob, leafy berry and earth. On the finish, it's full bodied and soft, with ripe black-fruit flavors that register as thick and a touch raisiny. Drink now.",RSV 1601 El Duque de Lerma,88,75,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Real Sitio de Ventosilla
39000,Spain,"Dense black plum and berry aromas are earthy, flat and jammy by Calvario standards. Feels chewy and hefty, with grabby, driving tannins and roasted flavors of blackberry, espresso and herbs. Not as complex and interesting compared to great vintages, but still an impressive Rioja cut from a modern cloth. Drink now through 2016.",Calvario,90,124,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Finca Allende
39040,Spain,"Husky on the nose but mostly it comes across as wild, with jumpy, loud pear, melon and apple aromas. The mouth is spunky and all over the map, while flavors of tangy yellow fruits carry an acidic, herbal twinge and even a grassy quality. Lacks perfect poise but it can't be called timid or dull.",Pazo Barrantes,86,19,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Pazo de Barrantes
39047,Spain,"A simple but nice style of Ribera wine with open plum and berry aromas as well as snappy, juicy, fresh red fruit flavors. It's a touch biting and zesty at this point, but if you don't mind a little bite and zap it's perfectly good.",Crianza,86,NA,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Protos
39059,Spain,"Here's another good value red from Borsao. It's about as potent and packed a wine as you'll find for $7, and while it's jumpy, young and aggressive, it's also full of jammy black fruit, sticky extraction and firm tannins. A classic mouthfiller with spunk, color and heft.",Monte Oton,86,7,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Borsao
39273,Spain,"Ripe apple aromas make the nose nice, even though it's flattening with age. Likewise on the palate, which delivers pithy orange and dry melon flavors along with indications that it's just starting to fade. Notes of green herbs and scallion come up on the finish. Drink this mature white immediately.",NA,88,17,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Val do Sosego
39280,Spain,"This Garnacha is perfectly good in every way, shape and form. The nose is loaded with bright berry aromas and a hint of mint. The palate feels lively and right, while flavors of raspberry, blackberry and leather lead to a deep, long, slightly hot finish.",Selección Especial,88,15,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Garnacha,Marqués de Montañana
39296,Spain,"This small-lot, dry Pedro Ximénez is maderized and oxidized, but also interesting. The nose is waxy and resiny, with dusty peach and apricot aromas. In the mouth, it's complex and mature, however the flavors are bitter and subdued, with corn and wheaty notes. A bready, honeyed finish brings things around. Just 90 cases made.",Ximensis,88,40,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Pedro Ximénez,Genium Celler
39345,Spain,"Mildly earthy, leathery and light in color, with rooty aromas and tree bark on the nose. The palate is good, maybe a bit sharp and angular, with savory flavors of tomato, red plum and earth. Dry on the finish and good for everyday consumption.",Glorioso,86,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Palacio
39369,Spain,"Deep and earthy on the nose, with cedar, tobacco and plodding berry aromas. This is more full and thick than light and elegant; the palate is fruity and tannic, with plump plum and dark berry flavors. Chocolaty but monotone on the finish. Drink now.",Gran Reserva,90,50,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Marqués de Riscal
39370,Spain,"Warm and powerful stuff, with potent black fruit, latex and oak-driven vanilla aromas. Saturated and jammy, with oaky flavors of hard spice, blackberry, burnt toast and pepper. Feels a little hot and crusty on the finish.",Probus,90,30,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tempranillo,Volvoreta
39379,Spain,"Begins with a full blast of toast and char, and then come notes of lemon, leather and rooty, sweet berry fruit. Borderline syrupy in feel, with heavy concentration and baked flavors of molasses and chocolate to go with blackberry. Seems a little over the top and stewy, but there's no doubting its ripe, round character.",Roda Reserva,89,45,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Roda
39386,Spain,"Woodsy and rich smelling, with sous-bois, ample spice, ripe berry aromas and weight. It shows texture and grip on the palate, followed by baked, smoky flavors of roasted black fruits and toast. Finishes foresty and warm. Appealing in every way. Drink now through 2013.",Reserva,89,28,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
39427,Spain,"Rich, smoky and heady, with earthy black fruit aromas that fold in mocha and vanilla. The palate runs fairly crisp and firm for a big wine, with black cherry, spice, peppercorn and herbal flavors. Super lively, tight and showing cola and lemon peel on the woody finish. Drink from 2012–2018.",Finca El Bosque,92,170,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
39580,Spain,"This is a warm, weighty Tempranillo with earthy, leathery, baked berry aromas.

39592,Spain,"This is dark as night, with boysenberry, blackberry, animal fur and smooth oak aromas. For $10, it's bringing all sorts of power and quality, like oak-influenced flavors of vanilla, chocolate, blackberry and cassis. On the finish, this is full and smacks down with tannic grab.",Tinto,88,10,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Red Blend,Figaro
39593,Spain,"This focused, crisp Tempranillo from a nice, warm vintage offers a mix of fresh plum, raspberry, vanilla and spice on the bouquet. It's honest and correct in the mouth, with plum, cherry, dry spice and light oak flavors. A clean, mellow finish is an appropriate ending for this midtier Rioja.",Cantos de Valpiedra,88,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Finca Valpiedra
39595,Spain,"Aromas of vanilla, stewed red berry, leather, cheese and heat indicate a ripe wine entering it's peak years. This is tannic and grating in the mouth, with syrupy flavors of prune and chocolate. The finish carries a baked character along with flavors of raisin and liqueur. Drink now.",Coma d'En Pou,88,35,Catalonia,Terra Alta,NA,Red Blend,Celler Bàrbara Forés
39597,Spain,"This unusual varietal wine hits with a giant wall of herbal aromas that suggest tomato leaf, oregano and basil. The palate is firm and structured in feel, with smacking tannins and flavors of dark berry fruits, green herbs and coffee. A peppery tasting finish with residual green flavors and mocha works for this decidedly herbal-leaning but high-quality wine. Drink now.",Inspiración,88,45,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Maturana,Bodegas Valdemar
39640,Spain,"For a higher-priced wine, this has some issues. The nose is heavy and murky, with leathery, baked aromas. In the mouth, it's somewhat choppy and acidic, thus punctuating the cherry tomato portion of the earth-and-leather flavor profile. Lingering oak accents the finish, which is zesty and leans toward sour.",Flor de Lasierpe Viñas Viejas,85,22,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Garnacha,Dominio Lasierpe
39647,Spain,"Rusty in hue, with mature, slightly old aromas of leather, gym bag, dried leaves and mature berry. The palate has depth and concentration, while the flavors are herbal and run toward baked black cherry and tobacco. Caramel and mature fruit flavors vie for control of the roasted finish.",Viña Centuria,85,17,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra del Bajo Aragón,NA,Garnacha,Bodegas Tempore
39658,Spain,"A clean, nice, regular Tempranillo with normal black cherry and berry aromas that offer hints of rubber and bacon. The palate is tannic and grabby but balanced for the most part, with pure, basic blackberry and cherry flavors. Modest in its scope, but fresh and untainted.",Organic Wine,85,12,Levante,Utiel-Requena,NA,Tempranillo,Spartico
39680,Spain,"Intense up front, with potent black fruit aromas offset by a lactic creaminess. Racy and juicy in the mouth as bright, penetrating blackberry flavors hit hard and then are softened by flavors of chocolate and mocha. Feels a little acidic and strained, but should age nicely for up to five years.",Roureda Llicorella Clàssic,89,20,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Cellers Unió
39688,Spain,"A healthy wine with plenty of oak. On the nose, it's charred as well as fruity, with raspberry and plum aromas blending with vanilla.

Drink now through 2013.",Reserva,89,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Finca del Marquesado
39894,Spain,"With solid berry and plum aromas, the bouquet is friendly and nice. This is fresh and fruity in style, with hints of leather and chocolate accenting core berry and plum flavors. An earthy, warm finish with leathery notes is the final act.",Premium 1904,87,28,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Bodegas Navarro López
39965,Spain,"Aromas of pine, rubber and rhubarb are austere, and so is the rest of the wine. The palate is run by acidity, which is sharp and scouring. Flavors are tart and underdone, with pie cherry and red raspberry. Sheering but admittedly cleansing, with surprising sourness.",Capricho,85,20,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Garnacha,Cruz de Piedra
39968,Spain,"Dusty and with nice apple and spice aromas. The palate, however, is quite flat and devoid of a lively bubble bead. Flavors of pear and melon run sweet, while the finish is dull and lacks effervescence.",Brut Exclusive Reserva,85,15,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Marqués de Gelida
39970,Spain,"Quite an oaky wine, with aromas of BBQ, hickory, roasted plum and spice. The body is full but scratchy, with additional oak manifesting itself in the form of baked, rooty, vanilla flavors that override the wine's simple but quiet fruit content. Finishes dark and toasty, with coffee, mocha and vanilla flavors.",Corona d'Aragón Reserva,85,18,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Red Blend,Grandes Vinos y Viñedos
39982,Spain,"For an '04 reserva, this wine is more edgy, grabby and high in acid than expected. The nose shows old world leather, spearmint and smoked meat more than vibrant fruit, yet the palate is tangy, citric and tastes of red raspberry and plum. Slightly more creamy on the finish, but still it remains scratchy.",Reserva,85,29,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Vallobera
40180,Spain,"The nose on this regularly solid Verdejo is mild, with aromas of apple, pear and melon. The palate is round and a touch fleshy, with modest acidity pushing pithy peach and pear flavors. The finish tastes of almond skins and apple.",NA,87,13,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Palacio de Bornos
40183,Spain,"Leathery, stalky berry aromas are a bit rustic, and so is the feel. But the flavors on this Cabernet from Cariñena are satisfying and forward, suggesting stewed plum, baked berry and sun-drenched warmth. This is almost cooked but it pulls back. At six years of age it is what it is; drink now.",NA,87,18,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon,V&N; Cellars
40267,Spain,"Smoky, rubbery and lightly baked smelling, but also generous and full, with berry and vanilla aromas.

Healthy and well made as a whole; drink now through 2014.",Fé Reserva,89,25,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Xavier Flouret
40271,Spain,"Roasted, leathery and sulphuric out of the bottle, but time serves it well and soon herbal notes, tanned saddle and baked berry aromas emerge. Feels a bit sheer and tight, with fiery plum and berry flavors. Grippy on the finish, so it needs time in bottle or plenty of air if you're drinking now.",Selecció Especial,89,95,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Ferrer Bobet
40297,Spain,"Clean, fruity and snappy, with pointed red fruit aromas and flavors as well as higher than normal acidity.

40305,Spain,"Almost red in color, with dusty aromas that mix in a blast of latex and dried cherry notes. The wine is made from organically grown Bobal grapes, and it offers tang and bite along with crisp flavors of plum skins, raspberry and citrus. Almost sour, but not. A solid quaffer for the price.",Albero Bobal,85,6,Levante,Utiel-Requena,NA,Rosé,Iranzo Fields
40312,Spain,"A standard Riojano red with crisp cherry aromas followed by a zesty, slightly tart palate that carries punchy cherry fruit, acidity and little nuance or character. Tastes a tiny bit sour by today's measurements, but it's still pretty good for being crisp and acid-driven.",Don Román,85,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Marques de Tomares
40315,Spain,"Slightly vinegary on the cherry-laden nose, with a mild but persistent briney character. The palate is high in acid, leading to some scour, but the flavors of plum and berry, while generic, are pretty good. Finishes with hints of toast, pepper and spice. Solid enough for $8.",NA,84,8,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Ermita San Antonio
40378,Spain,"Rock solid and dense, with aromas of black cherry and cassis along with a whiff of aged cheese. The palate is tight, tannic and rubbery, with grabby black cherry and blackberry flavors along with toasty, dark shadings. Finishes firm, with a touch of black olive and herbs. The best MC to date; drink now through 2017.",MC,91,46,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marqués de Cáceres
40532,Spain,"Sweet and fiery on the nose, with piercing aromas that burn right up your nasal passages. The palate is pinched and super tannic, with biting flavors of black licorice, blackberry and cola. Could be better with a softer, smoother mouthfeel but seeing that this is an '04 with six years behind it, it isn't going to soften up much.",Gran Dama de Toro,84,45,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Fariña
40533,Spain,"Smells a little too much like berry candy and cough syrup to win you over, and the palate is kind of flat and chunky as well as thick with creamy berry fruit. Points of acidic bite give it life, but things are brought back down on the finish with green, creamy oak notes.",Inspiración Valdemar,84,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Valdemar
40540,Spain,"Quite candied and jumpy on the nose, what some might call bug juice. Having spent six months in American oak, it's tight and tough on the palate, with fresh, juicy acidity that's a bit scouring. Tastes much like milk chocolate and candied fruit.",Roble,84,NA,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Protos
40543,Spain,"Begins with pasty, lactic aromas and heavy fruit. The palate is both big and clumsy, with sharp acidity amid bulk leading to choppy plum and medicinal cherry flavors. A clacky wine with power but not much finesse.",Jardín de Lúcolo,84,20,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Garnacha,Bodegas la Casa de Lúcolo
40550,Spain,"Jammy, dark and reduced, with breadth along with leather and compost aromas. The palate is leathery, funky and medicinal, with viscosity and creamy berry flavors. Has richness and body but the flavors and congruety are sketchy until you remember that it costs but $7.",NA,84,7,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,Venta Morales
40556,Spain,"Neon pink in color, with heavier aromas that split time between chemical and candied. The palate is a bit awkward and heavy, with jumbled flavors of pomegranate juice, cherry and strawberry. Loses focus as it moves along, and finishes with a slightly bitter aftertaste.",Conde de Valdemar Rosado,84,9,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Rosé,Bodegas Valdemar
40558,Spain,"Simple at best early on, with leathery, rustic aromas and a truly basic set of flavors. Should you allow it to breathe, it rounds into a good (but still basic), semisoft and fruity red with solid cherry/berry flavors and nothing offputting.",Tinto,84,8,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Red Blend,Coto de Hayas
40654,Spain,"An oaky, modern-style wine with a staunch mocha and vanilla influence, but the fruit is ripe and rich enough to handle it. Spicy and grainy on the nose, with vanilla and resin seeping through. The palate remains woody but is full of berry flavors, while the omnipresent barrel influence carries onto the rich, ripe finish.",Crianza,88,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,El Coto
40744,Spain,"Stony aromas of green melon and apple are mellow and classy. This is fresh on the palate, with a burst of acidity to brighten things up. Flavors of citrus fruits, green apple, nectarine and stony minerality finish similarly.",NA,90,22,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,As Laxas
40765,Spain,"Dusty apple aromas are given lift courtesy of citrus notes. This feels good on the palate, with zesty acidity. Flavors of stone fruits, tropical fruits, apple and citrus meld together well, while the finish is pure and long.",NA,90,17,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Nessa
40801,Spain,"A very good value-priced Rioja with rubber and hickory on the bouquet along with light touches of cassis and red plum.

40832,Spain,"Neon purple in color, young and jumpy, but hey, that's what simple Garnacha from this part of Spain is all about. Expect fruity, jammy aromas and a blazing, full-fruited palate of rubber, black fruits and bacon. It's grapey but honest, and for the price it's as expected.",NA,84,8,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Garnacha,Garnacha de Fuego
40833,Spain,"Aromas of chocolate mint, creamy vanilla and candy reflect a heavy-handed oak treatment, and a sweet burnt cherry and chocolate mint character is present throughout. Creamy on the tongue, but confected in terms of flavors and finish.",Crianza,84,18,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Dinastía Vivanco
40840,Spain,"Somewhat stewy and leathery for starters, with a thick, creamy palate that shows stemmy, roasted plum and berry flavors. The feel is solid and thick, but the flavors don't really come around and settle.",Crianza,84,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marqués de Campo Nuble
40844,Spain,"Fairly light and leathery, with strained aromas of animal hide and burnt berry fruit. The palate feel is light to medium, with scratchiness, and the flavors are of roasted fruit, leather and dryness. Spice and a slight bitterness define the finish. Has a few issues but still a good wine for $10.",Crianza,84,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Campo Viejo
40852,Spain,"Palacio Quemado, which means the Burnt Palace, is a funky wine from Extremadura that mixes forceful floral aromas with barnyard and grape juice scents. It's a fuller-bodied, grabby wine with chunky, medicinal flavors and a finish that meanders before settling on big and herbal. Has its good points and weaknesses.",Palacio Quemado Crianza,84,15,Central Spain,Ribera del Guadiana,NA,Tempranillo,Alvear
41032,Spain,"Sweet smelling, with a touch of pastry. Focused, lean and nice in the mouth, showing dry apple and citrus peel flavors. Solid Cava that brings a modicum of leesy, pithy richness on the finish.",Brut Reserva,87,18,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Sabartés
41033,Spain,"Jumps out of the chute with baked, earthy, funky aromas that are more savory and spicy than outright fruity. The palate has a good but limited mouthfeel, while the flavors of raspberry are spicy and saucy. Good in a subtle, earthy, nonfruity way.",Crianza Vendimia Seleccionada Finca Valdelayegua,87,19,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Prado Rey
41034,Spain,"Dark purple in color, with a jammy nose of berry fruit and coconut. The palate is concentrated, a little narrow and sharp in the center, with snappy, pointed cherry and berry flavors. Fruity but sheer wine, with dashes of nutmeg and cocoa powder on the finish.",Elite Vendimia Seleccionada,87,29,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinta Fina,Prado Rey
41037,Spain,"Comes across a bit baked, syrupy and sweet on the nose, with a hint of stalkiness and stem. The palate has a lush early feel, but further inspection unveils a hollow core. Flavors veer toward earthy raspberry, while the finish is chunky and properly reflects what came before it.",Reserva,87,40,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Vilano
41132,Spain,"Starts with tough, almost harsh green aromas on the nose, but with time it settles on herbs and tobacco. The palate is fresh but a touch spiky and grabby, with herbal plum and berry flavors. Solid mouthfeel and length make it worthwhile even if it's herbal and slightly green tasting.",La Cantera,84,8,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Garnacha,Castillo de Monjardin
41133,Spain,"Opens with vinaigrette and balsamic notes along with leather and black fruit aromas. The palate is soft and muddled, with soupy, stewy flavors and a jagged, candied finish. Seems to struggle for balance, which is a common flaw in many Toro wines.",Carodorum Tinta de Toro Crianza,84,35,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Bodega Carmen Rodríguez
41145,Spain,"Sweet, plummy and unrefined on both the nose and palate. This is nothing more than simple juice that isn't terrible. It's grapey, sweet and tart, with an edgy bit of tang to the finish. Regular at best; subpar if you're being critical.",Peromato,83,9,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Fariña
41154,Spain,"Jammy aromas mix with grassy green notes in front of a sweet, chunky palate that offers unconvincing, generic berry flavors. Devoid of elegance and character but loaded with heft and baked fruit. A sweet, rudimentary wine.",NA,83,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Legado Muñoz
41155,Spain,"Balsamic and hard, with a briney, stemmy set of chemical-tinged black fruit aromas. The palate hits with force and noise; it's hard, tannic and unforgiving. The flavors of baked berry are rich, but the finish is grating and blazes with tannic burn.",Reserva,83,14,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Marqués de Olivara
41165,Spain,"Smells a bit foxy and gangly at first, with jumpy, almost sweaty aromas matching candied cassis and raisiny notes.

41167,Spain,"Salinic, crisp and peachy on the nose, with easy, ripe melon aromas to sweeten it up. Shows good body and spritz alongside tropical flavors of orange and melon. Finishes with weight before rolling away with elegance. Punchy and ready to go.",NA,88,25,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Mar de Frades
41206,Spain,"A little scratchy on the nose, but otherwise it exudes pure aromas of cassis and raspberry. The palate is juicy, racy and snappy but full and structured, while the flavors of raspberry, plum and blackberry get sweetness in the form of coconut and vanilla-infused coffee. Less soft and bodied than previous vintages but a big winner nonetheless.",Colección Privada,91,54,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
41293,Spain,"Coconut and vanilla aromas ride front and center on the oaky nose, although berry fruit rises up with time. The palate is bulky and saturated, almost what you'd call thick, while the flavors lean toward roasted berry, plum and woodspice. Vanilla and additional wood accents work the finish.",Reserva,87,23,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Condado de Oriza
41302,Spain,"Round and generally attractive, with raisiny richness that emerges with airing. The palate is more snappy and acidic than the nose might suggest, with herbal raspberry flavors. That same acidity lifts the finish, and overall the wine is fresh, racy and not that complex.",Reserva,87,25,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Prado Rey
41309,Spain,"From Viña Mayor, this French-oak-aged wine is composed and dry, with good plum and berry aromas that bring balanced oak as well.

Not mind blowing but good for a weak vintage.",Secreto,87,20,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Mayor
41436,Spain,"Bright and aggressive for Llopart, with lively orange and apricot aromas. Frothy to the point of being bubbly, with ripe, bouncy pink grapefruit and other citrus flavors. Stays racy and citrusy on the finish. All fruit; not complex.",Rosé Brut Reserva,88,22,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Llopart
41484,Spain,"Strawberry and raspberry aromas come on with aggression, and the bouquet doesn't really evolve. The palate is crisp, snappy and high in acid, with grating red cherry and red plum flavors. Decent red fruit character throughout but not much feel or depth.",NA,83,7,Levante,Utiel-Requena,NA,Tempranillo,Finca Milena
41489,Spain,"Mint, carob and green-tinged fruit aromas precede an herbal-tasting palate with olive-influenced plum, berry and cola flavors. From down south in Spain, it shows pretty good body and an okay mouthfeel, but the flavor profile is a little funky and strange.",Castillo de Almansa Tintorera,83,10,Central Spain,Almansa,NA,Garnacha,Bodegas Piqueras
41512,Spain,"An elegant and well-made Albariño with lemon chiffon, pear and green apple aromas.

Drink this pretty wine as soon as possible.",NA,90,15,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Leira
41610,Spain,"Slightly more leafy, herbal and burnt on the nose than ideal, but there's also tobacco, cherry and earth notes to keep it proper.

41611,Spain,"Raisiny, sweet and baked, with plenty of oak coming on as it airs out. This vintage is somewhat syrupy and strained compared to prior years, with baked black fruit flavors. Seems a little reduced on the finish, but overall it's still good given this winery's strong track record and how the wine compares to other 2007 Riojas.",Propiedad,87,40,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Palacios Remondo
41620,Spain,"Solid, big and fruity, which is basically what a Campo de Borja Garnacha should be. Sweet red fruits and robust kick define the palate, which is tannic but not obtrusively so. Zesty and a bit of a one-noter, but a nice one. Garnacha with 30% Syrah and 10% Mourvèdre.",Lot 98,87,10,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Red Blend,Cameron Hughes
41624,Spain,"Dry, dusty and minty on the nose, with cherry, cedar and sweet oak notes. The palate has a hard, clangy bite to it, while the flavors run toward herbal cherry and dried tobacco. Some vanilla and cola along the way bring up the pleasure quotient. Drink now.",Miros de Ribera Reserva,87,50,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Peñafiel
41636,Spain,"Opens with peach and apple aromas that are 100% normal, while the palate has a chiseled clarity to it that's crisp and appreciated.

Finishes dry and herbal.",Viña Pomal Reserva,87,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Bilbainas
41748,Spain,"Starts out with scratchy, edgy aromas of dried fruits, orange peel and tobacco. It's fairly light in concentration and weight, with woodsy, spicy flavors of vanilla, oak and foresty fruit. Above average but resides in that upper-middle tier.",Fincas de Landaluce Crianza,87,19,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Landaluce
41761,Spain,"Smells fairly burnt and dull, with earthy, stemmy aromas that are strained and tough.

Rustic and stemmy, with a low pulse.",Crianza,83,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Rioja Vega
41772,Spain,"Jammy and flat smelling, with little to no depth to the nose. The palate is snappy but there's just enough body to offset the acidity, while the flavors of red fruits are tart and regular. Dull tasting, with a fairly long finish that's unexciting.",Vertus,82,10,Levante,Utiel-Requena,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Iranzo
41789,Spain,"A green, struggling wine from front to back.

41882,Spain,"Fairly generous for a bargain-priced, everyday Rioja.

Meets any reasonable expectation of what $12 Rioja should be.",NA,87,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
41897,Spain,"Nice for a standard, no-frills type of Rioja. The cherry and raspberry aromas are sweet and clean, while the palate is juicy, fresh and tastes of ripe cherry, berry, vanilla and cream. Offers good clarity, power and depth given its price point.",Crianza,87,8,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Rivarey
41899,Spain,"Slightly dry and leafy on the nose, but with beef jerky, cola and mild raisin aromas. The palate is forward, with controlled heat and tannin along with cola, berry and mushroom flavors.

Drink now through 2012.",Manuel Quintano Reserva,90,50,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Castillo Labastida
42143,Spain,"A barrel-aged surprise. The nose is round and toasty but not overwooded. The palate is balanced and elegant, with full, round, integrated flavors of dry apple, cream and spice.

42182,Spain,"Opens with unique, abnormal aromas of spiced fruit, cardamom and nutmeg.

Earthy and funky wine, but with good feel and overall good character.",Nuestro,87,27,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Diaz Bayo
42194,Spain,"Not even El Bosque could escape the difficulties of the cool, extended 2007 vintage. While typically dark and bulky on the nose, it's also dull by Bosque standards, with oaky mocha and coffee stepping in as filler. The body is drawn and tannic, with oak, resin and dark berry flavors. Finishes resiny as well. By no means bad, but given Bosque's precedent it's not stellar.",Finca El Bosque,87,163,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria

Very fresh and colorful, but lacking in stuffing and complexity.",9 Barricas,87,70,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Rioja Vega
42369,Spain,"Jammy smelling but also lean and minty. The palate is almost sour, a bit better later on, but never does it rise above tight, lean and tart.

42715,Spain,"Lower in price than Cenit's Old Vines, but to me this is a better, more open wine with bacon, spice and bold black-fruit aromas. The palate is full but retains finesse as well as big tannins; flavors of black fruits come with chocolate, coffee and spice. Full-force stuff but still fairly refined. Drink now through 2014.",Demora,92,30,Northern Spain,Tierra del Viños de Zamora,NA,Tempranillo,Viñas del Cenit
42717,Spain,"Dark, condensed and inky, with big, muscular aromas of charcoal, cassis liqueur, blackberry and tar.

43649,Spain,"A touch minty and dry smelling, with simple, solid, slightly underdeveloped flavors. All in all, it's hard to find much brightness in this wine; instead it's subdued and chocolaty, and it never really crosses the Rubicon of ripeness. That said, it goes down easy and doesn't burn like many Toro wines.",Gran Colegiata Barrica,86,12,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Bodegas Fariña
43673,Spain,"Roasted plum and raspberry aromas offer accents of vanilla, dill and dry wood. The palate is big, a little soft and chubby in the middle, with savory, herbal black fruit flavors that are meaty and deep. Finishes earthy, herbal and with integrity. This is Monastrell that's ready to go.",Altos de Luzón,89,19,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Luzón
43812,Spain,"A little earthy and rough at first, with rubbery aromas. After time it evolves to deliver a weighty palate full of black fruit, oak and medicinality. Dry, toasty and a bit hot and scratchy on the finish. Nice for $11 Ribera del Duero.",Tempranillo,86,11,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Torremoron
43814,Spain,"Scratchy and a little sharp smelling on first impression, with vanilla and milk chocolate aromas in addition to standard red fruit scents. Feels firm, solid and basic, with dark fruit flavors touched up by young, simple oak notes. Standard and dry on the finish.",Vendimia Seleccionada,86,15,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Sembro
43827,Spain,"Generic and rose-like on the nose, with a hint of raspberry. The mouthfeel is pure, fresh and easy, with proper acidity pushing raspberry, plum and buttery oak flavor. Feels juicy and scouring on the finish, with length and freshness.",Signa,86,11,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marqués de la Concordia
43865,Spain,"Warm and smooth, with aromas of fresh dill, spiced cherries, mulled earth and more. The palate has a full, stacked feel with well-oaked flavors of vanilla, toffee and earthy berries. Finishes chewy, with complexity and light flavors of caramel and tobacco. Ready to drink.",Solpost,91,25,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Red Blend,Cellers Sant Rafel
43866,Spain,"Super smooth and complete on the nose, with black fruit, toasty oak and earth notes rolled into a nice whole. It's lush, plump and balanced, with full blackberry, raisin, chocolate and spice flavors resting in front of a mellow, spicy finish. A pretty, balanced blend of 75% Tempranillo and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon that shows Jumilla at its best.",Taja Excelecia,91,23,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Mähler-Besse
43891,Spain,"Some Barbier wines, depending on when you catch them, are fresh, pleasant and overdeliver. Others are dull and dead. This one falls into the first category with its melon, apple and Asian pear aromas and flavors. It's lithe, light in body and clean. Good as it gets for $6.",Mediterranean White,86,6,Catalonia,Catalunya,NA,White Blend,René Barbier
43896,Spain,"This seems like the best bet among the Tempra Tantrum lineup. The nose has vibrancy and good fruit content, while the palate is sizable and shows solid balance. Flavors of cherry and red plum are good, and the finish has some length.",NA,86,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo-Shiraz,Tempra Tantrum
43900,Spain,"Applesauce aromas are open and inoffensive, and the palate is wet and refreshing, with crisp, dry green apple and generic white fruit flavors. As a brut nature, it makes sense that the finish would be wet, lean and taste like lime-infused soda water.",Brut Nature Gran Reserva,86,16,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Sabartés
43901,Spain,"Light raspberry and plum aromas feature a side note of citrus peel, while the flavors are pure but rudimentary dark berry, plum and herb. Good body and structure, but not complex or layered. Finishes peppery and a touch bitter, with short-lasting fruit.",La Vendimia,86,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Palacios Remondo
43909,Spain,"Emilio Moro's first foray into the land of value-priced wine is good but nothing special. The nose is brambly and dusty, like the inside of a Topps baseball card package. Meanwhile, the palate is tight and lean, with cherry flavors infiltrated by dry oak. Overall it's typical of a solid but average red wine.",Finca Resalso,85,15,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto Fino,Emilio Moro
43910,Spain,"Condensed, syrupy cherry aromas are a little candied, while the palate is acidic and angular, with juicy, tomatoey cherry and plum flavors. Fairly tight and lean in the mouth, with just enough oak to create a mocha/cocoa accent on the finish. For the price, there isn't much body, variety of flavor or pleasantries.",Horizonte de Exopto,85,37,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Exopto
43912,Spain,"A mildly baked wine with a touch of raisin, brine and stem on the nose. The palate is grabby, with firm tannins and core flavors of cherry, blackberry and dry oak. Beyond that, there isn't a whole lot else on offer, and the fruit breaks up on the transition from palate to finish.",El Primavera,85,14,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Agrícola Labastida
43918,Spain,"Strawberry and raspberry aromas are a little stalky and stemmy, while the palate is entirely regular in feel, weight and flavor. Speaking of flavors, things run a little tart and herbal, while the finish has an acidic yet fresh zestiness. Midlevel in every way.",NA,85,14,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Beronia
43927,Spain,"Stony, minerally aromas are a touch dusty and suggest melon and peach. The palate is round and juicy, while flavors of lime, green melon and gooseberry finish mellow and easy, with a touch of residual citric acid.",Nebla,88,10,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Vicente Gandia
43939,Spain,"Friendly aromas of apple and stone fruits are inviting and clean. This is cutting on the palate, but not overly so, with a good feel and cleansing acids. Apple and lime flavors finish bright and uncomplicated.",NA,88,18,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Finca Montepedroso
43966,Spain,"Creamy and minty on the nose, with dark berry aromas that veer toward raisiny. The palate is generous, full, reduced and narrow, with raisin, blackberry and heavy spice flavors. An old-vines style of Monastrell that lumbers across the finish line with full ripeness and sweetness. Drink now.",Limited Collection,88,25,Levante,Yecla,NA,Monastrell,Creencia
44106,Spain,"Fresh and easy to like. Smells clean and open, with peach and other white fruit aromas. You name the white or citrus fruit, and it's here: pineapple, grapefruit, mango and lime. Hits both the sweet and citrusy bases.",Valiñas,86,14,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Ramón Bilbao
44108,Spain,"Aromas of pencil lead, rubber and spice accent distant red fruit notes. The palate is none too deep, with dilution and bracing acidity. Tastes perky and lightly leafy, with cherry, raspberry, dry spice and finally buttery oak. Whispy but hollow for an '06 reserva.",Reserva,86,19,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Castillo Clavijo
44111,Spain,"Red fruit, cassis and sweet rubbery notes define the ripe bouquet. Feels medium to full in size, with leafy flavors mixed with plum, vanilla and oak. Red fruits including strawberry and raspberry work the mildly oaky finish.",Crianza,86,10,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,Condesa de Leganza
44121,Spain,"Baked and earthy on the opening, with meaty, spiced aromas that settle on roasted and heavy. Feels mostly healthy, with vanilla and dill flavors leading the way for roasted berry and oak spice. Finishes juicy but drawn down.",Elaboración Especial Tempranillo,86,18,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Beronia
44124,Spain,"Smoky and spicy on the nose, with lightly raisined berry fruit aromas. Feels compact and solid, with plum, prune, chocolate and toasty flavors, and just enough acidity to maintain balance and length on the finish. Good Rioja for $10.",Antaño Crianza,86,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,J. Garcia Carrion
44161,Spain,"Clean, minerally, slightly green in aromatics and oh so approachable and nice. For an under-$15 white, this Godello from Monterrei excels with layered flavors of apple, minerals and natural spice. The finish is long and hints at fresh herbs like thyme and tarragon. Potentially superb with garlic shrimp or calamari over fresh greens.",Pazo de Monterrey,90,14,Galicia,Monterrei,NA,Godello,Pazos del Rey
44177,Spain,"Rooty, warm and leathery at first, and then it really rounds into form. This Garnacha-led multigrape blend is a pretty, earthy, stylish wine that's at peak maturity. It brings baked, rich black cherry, cola and toffee flavors and then a finish of coffee and toast. A bit syrupy but still excellent and ready now.",Selecció Vinyes Velles,90,23,Northern Spain,Empordà,NA,Red Blend,Martí Fabra
44181,Spain,"White pear, melon and almond skin aromas are good and correct, while the peachy palate has roundness and interesting flavors of orange, lime and nectarine. Crisp, precise and well-glued together, with harmony throughout. A textbook food-friendly white that's more interesting than other Rías Baixas wines due to the addition of Loureira and Caiño Blanco to traditional Albariño.",O Rosal,90,24,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,White Blend,Terras Gauda
44183,Spain,"Roasted and baked on first blush, but then the wine's complexity and use of unusual Mallorcan grape varieties take over. Along the way there's flavors and aromas of prune, earth, leather, spice and Mediterranean terroir. It's also bringing tobacco and leaf notes to the table. A fun, different wine that goes nicely with tapas. Drink now through 2011–12.",ÀN/2,90,25,Spanish Islands,Vi de la Terra Illes Balears,NA,Red Blend,Ànima Negra
44191,Spain,"The name means “Sea of Vines,” and that's what you see in Rías Baixas. Here, we have a dry, crisp white with apple and apricot on the nose and a bit of roundness, weight and chunkiness in the mouth. Tastes of pithy apple and apricot, with mild bitterness on the finish. Drink now.",NA,85,15,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Mar de Viñas
44192,Spain,"Dry and not all that fruity up front, with a blast of oak. The palate shows weight and bold acidity, which pumps up the lemon, apple and pineapple flavors. A bit sour, scouring and sharp, but also cleansing and fresh. Blunt white wine.",Cuesta Del Aire,85,15,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Sauvignon Blanc-Verdejo,Storks' Tower
44201,Spain,"Dark in color, with aromas of bacon fat, blackberry candy and vanilla. The body is medium to full, with grabby tannins that support mildly medicinal blackberry and cherry flavors. Finishes clean and regular, with no nasty residue or forced oak.",Codice,85,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tinto Fino,Dominio de Eguren
44206,Spain,"A tutti-frutti nose leans toward candied cherry and red plum, while the palate is lean, a touch shrill and tastes of lightly herbal red fruits. Nothing heavy or weighty here; it's a simple, perfectly good everyday Rioja with a hint of oak.",NA,85,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Darien
44211,Spain,"A rough, raw wine from Galicia that starts with a swirl of hard fruit aromas, heat and chemical. The palate is jacked up with berry fruit, tannic bite and power, and the finish is chewy and rugged. Packed with color and flavor but also aggression. Definitely not for everyone.",Barrica,85,23,Galicia,Ribeira Sacra,NA,Red Blend,Abadía da Cova
44212,Spain,"Neutral, clean, good white wine for the money. The nose features green apple and lemon, and the low-octane body shows brine, citrus fruit flavors and pithy notes. White grapefruit and orange flavors carry the simple finish to a good ending.",Mesta,85,7,Central Spain,Uclés,NA,Macabeo-Moscatel,Bodegas Fontana
44216,Spain,"Light, simple and ready to drink. More acidic than some, with a cleansing, almost sour flavor package of green apple and lemon. Shows a lot of unabsorbed acidity on the finish, which forces the wine toward being crisp and minimalist. Drink now.",NA,85,18,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Pazo San Mauro
44411,Spain,"Earthy, baked, raisiny aromas convey ripeness and sweetness. The palate is medium in body and intensity, with juicy acidity propping up lightly leafy and herbal berry and plum flavors. Has good length and feel, with tomato and herbs on the finish.",Old Vines Gran Reserva,86,20,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Navarro López
44446,Spain,"Pure and forward, with minerally aromas of citrus, grapefruit and wet stone. For basic Verdejo, this is head and shoulders above most; it bursts with fresh orange, grapefruit, green apple and peach, and the finish is pure and long. So tasty and super easy to like; a highly recommended go-to value white.",NA,90,15,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Naia
44502,Spain,"Peach, melon, apple and minerally aromas are easy to like. This has a standard Rías Baixas feel and moderate citric acidity. Flavors of melon and nectarine finish nice and a bit sweet. Call this textbook Albariño and enjoy it.",NA,88,17,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Mar de Viñas
44520,Spain,"A barrel-heavy blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Verdejo? That's what this is, so expect popcorn and bland white fruit along with plenty of acidity. On one hand, it's an angular, sour wine that makes you wonder; on the other hand, it blends toast, butter, baked apple and lemon into a nutty whole that's not bad. Has both merits and faults.",Tríptico,85,25,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Verdejo-Sauvignon Blanc,Storks' Tower
44521,Spain,"Light, floral and almondy, with hints of pear, apple and buttercup on the nose. More creamy and soft than acidic, with pear and vanilla flavors. The finish holds steady for a while, and overall the wine is likable. 75% Viura and 25% Chardonnay.",NA,85,8,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,White Blend,Vega Sindoa
44527,Spain,"Dark, fiery, forceful and woody, with aromas of sawdust atop black fruit. The palate is zesty, lively and hard, with biting tannins raising up flavors of blackberry and pepper. Acidic, rough and tough, but with good flavors and a decent amount of integrity.",NA,85,16,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,Volver
44546,Spain,"Rubber and bacon aromas announce that this wine has some size, depth and concentration along with oak shadings, while the palate is fruity, acidic and tangy, with generic berry flavors and an added dose of oak-driven bacon and rubber. Solid at first and then thin on the finish.",Tinto Figuero 4,85,15,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,García Figuero
44549,Spain,"With good fruit and controlled aromas, it does what young Toro should when done well. Tight in the mouth, with bold black cherry flavors, it bites down with young, big tannins, but it doesn't burn or grate. Shades of mint and chocolate help it along.",Bajoz,85,10,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tempranillo,Pagos del Rey
44708,Spain,"A simple quaffer with lime, pineapple and minerally aromas. It's light and easygoing, with a dilute feel and tropical flavors of mango, lime and apple. Lasting and fairly juicy on the finish.",Blanco Vendimia Seleccionada,85,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Bodegas Muriel
44719,Spain,"Neutral on the nose, with a slight tropical leaning. Well cut in feel, with good acidity and light, wheaty flavors of banana and citrus. Highly regular, solid and clean. Say no more.",Old Vines Made with Organically Grown Grapes,85,11,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Xarel-lo,Marqués de Gelida
44726,Spain,"After wading through some burn and heat on the nose, things settle on basic red fruit. The feel is fresh and zesty, while flavors of plum and berry are about as average and normal as they come. Feels racy, slick and quick on the finish.",NA,85,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Castillo Clavijo
44758,Spain,"A tough, sun-belted wine with concentration, big tannins and a ton of power and flavor. The nose is all bacon, balsamic notes, tobacco and roasted black fruit, while the ridged palate is dark and tastes of blackberry, molasses, coconut and brown sugar. Edgy, lemony and tannic on the finish. Drink now with beef; can be held for another 3–5 years.",Cenit Old Vines,90,48,Northern Spain,Tierra del Viños de Zamora,NA,Tempranillo,Viñas del Cenit
44820,Spain,"Rooty, tough aromas are brambly, while the palate is narrow in feel, drying and tastes of herbal raspberry and cherry. Quite snappy and a little sharp, with a quick finish of red fruit, tomato and zest. Could improve with aging, but at this point the wine, while solid, seems lacking in stuffing.",Reserva,85,NA,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Pedrosa
44823,Spain,"For a Ribera rosé, this gets it mostly right. The nose is neutral and standard, while the spunky palate sports good acidity and flavors of strawberry and raspberry. Wet and refreshing on the finish, and good overall.",Rosado,85,10,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Recorba
44824,Spain,"Smells a bit cheesy and sour at first, and soon after oak and mild berry fruit take over. On the palate, it's dry, peppery and grabby, with solid but common plum and raspberry flavors. Tomato notes and herbal flavors come up on the finish, but all together it's a good but regular Ribera wine.",Vendimia Seleccionada,85,19,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Resalte
44836,Spain,"For a Priorat red, this is lean and snappy, with hot, stemmy aromas and light-bodied, racy fruit flavors. It's a blend of six different grapes, and overall it comes across just well enough to be worth a go. That said, it is kind of short and scratchy given its domain.",NA,85,15,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,La Ninota
44839,Spain,"Dark in color but a bit hot and clunky on the nose, where oak-based vanilla helps mask its true identity, which is choppy and tart. In between the wine's tang and zest, there's moderate sweetness, vanilla and mild wood notes stemming from the five months it spent in barrel.",NA,85,13,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Paramo de Corcos
44849,Spain,"A touch stalky on the nose, but after that it gets things mostly right. The fruit aromas and flavors are subdued, with jammy raspberry notes leading the way. There's no overt burn or grating feel, and that's good with inexpensive, niche-filling concept wines like this. Fine if you're expectations are modest.",NA,85,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo-Merlot,Tempra Tantrum
44954,Spain,"Yellowing and leesy in character, with a deep, brooding style. Struggles to keep its pulse up; the core flavors are in the bland citrus category, while peachy, leesy secondary flavors turn pithy on the finish. Tasted twice with consistent notes.",NA,85,19,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Fillaboa
44962,Spain,"A crusty smelling wine with aromas of crude oil, roasted nuts and modest berry fruit. Feels acidic and scratchy, with balsamic flavors and a chalky finish. Prickly and teetering on sour, with a lasting herbal impression.",Colección Vivanco Parcelas de Mazuelo,85,92,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Mazuelo,Dinastía Vivanco
44969,Spain,"Perfumed, chunky and almondy on the nose. Feels full and oily but also a bit juicy, with driving, penetrating orange and grapefruit flavors. Offers proper weight and spicy citrus flavors on the finish. Drink immediately as it's losing freshness and turning yellow.",Verdejo-Viognier-Sauvignon Blanc,85,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,White Blend,Volteo
44998,Spain,"A high level of purity from the start. The bouquet attracts with strong scents of mineral, flowers, wild herbs, berry fruit and toast. There's no shortage of bracing acidity, so the body weight and balance are just right. One of Spain's most food-friendly, elegant wines, and not run of the mill. The best expression of Mencia on the market today.",Villa de Corullon,92,45,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Descendientes de J. Palacios
45068,Spain,"Baked, earthy and leathery, just like all the AN wines. But there's also a smooth intersection of the old and new worlds here; it's one part rooty, oaky and rich but also dry, leathery and indigenous to the Balearics (the base grape is Callet). Finishes a little sweet and warm, and thus it's begging to be drunk now.",Àn,89,50,Spanish Islands,Vi de la Terra Illes Balears,NA,Red Blend,Ànima Negra
45077,Spain,"A more traditional type of crianza with vanilla, spice, dry berry fruit and a quiet, subtle approach. The mouthfeel is Old World with it's clean, dusty weight and proper acid-tannin balance, and the flavors of spice, cherry, dried currant and earth don't overstep their place. Very nice wine for under $20.",Crianza,89,17,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Valserrano
45088,Spain,"Nice, clean and vibrant, with a welcoming set of peach, apricot and citrusy aromas. The wine is 100% correct and fresh, with clarity and flavors of apple, peach and green grapes. Shows just enough body, acid and pith on the finish, but drink now before it starts to fade.",NA,89,18,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,As Laxas
45098,Spain,"This is a particular style of barrel-aged Verdejo that displays aromas of cured ham, fennel and not much fruit. This has creamy weight on the palate. Flavors of oily white fruits, nuts and charcuterie finish in a blaze of funky flavors, texture and residual oak. This heavyweight white isn't for everyone and it's by no means a mainstream rendition of Verdejo.",Edición Limitada 25 Aniversario,88,55,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Matarromera
45161,Spain,"Pop the cork and look for a bulky Mencía from the little-known region of Ribeira Sacra in Galicia. The wine has rubber, bacon and plum aromas, and then an enamel-like palate of black cherry and herbs. Tough stuff, but unique.",NA,85,17,Galicia,Ribeira Sacra,NA,Mencía,Rectoral de Amandi
45164,Spain,"Smells earthy, leathery and a bit gaseous before you get to a broad palate of stretched berry flavors, vanilla and herbal notes. There are good points here but also gaps in the wine, including a tomatoey quality to the flavor profile. Improves a bit with airing but still it struggles to make the grade.",LZ,85,18,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Telmo Rodríguez
45167,Spain,"A simple but pleasant Ribera red with berry-cherry aromas. The palate has a staunch, tannic grab to it as well as flavors of raspberry, black plum and earth. A wine that has o.k. length and solidity to the finish.",Tinto Roble,85,12,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Mayor
45169,Spain,"A heavy, briary wine that opens with a full blast of earthy compost and burnt leaves. The palate features pointed berry fruit along with a wall of oaky coconut and vanilla. Creamy on the finish, at least in terms of flavor, with lasting vanilla.",Crianza,85,28,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Peña Roble
45176,Spain,"Woody and dried out, with oak-based spice and burnt elements on the bouquet. The palate is gritty and acidic, with tart, limited, earthy cherry flavors. Not a disaster, but for a $46 wine from a great vintage it isn't offering many reasons to explore it.",Gran Reserva Cosecha,84,46,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Baron De Ley
45184,Spain,"This wine costs a lot for what it's giving. The nose starts out hard and fruitless, and while the aromas come around, the wine always holds onto its corn and haystack character. Zippy acidity gives the mouth zest, and it also livens up papaya, banana and apricot flavors. Complex and different, but does it taste good enough to justify a $78 price tag?",Kyrie,88,78,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,White Blend,Costers del Siurana
45194,Spain,"Starts out stewy, with exotic spice aromas that are uncommon but not unpleasant. That unusual spicy character persists throughout, and the feel is chewy and meaty while the fruit veers toward stewed blackberry, nutmeg and anise. A different breed of cat but a good one nonetheless. Drink now.",Agnus de Valdelana Reserva,88,53,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Valdelana
45256,Spain,"Tropical and forward, and with three months spent in oak, the wine offers some resin and vanilla both on the nose and in flavor. Tastes sweet, honeyed and nutty, with banana and melon notes. An easy drinker that will do best if well chilled.",White,85,8,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Macabeo,Borsao
45260,Spain,"Flowery and sweet smelling, then round and fairly smooth in the mouth. The bubbles and flavor package of tropical fruits galore is pleasant and shouldn't offend anyone. Finishes clean and easy. A mango boat of flavor.",Opera Prima Sparkling Moscato,85,8,Spain Other,Spain,NA,Sparkling Blend,J. Garcia Carrion
45311,Spain,"Interesting and very much showing Navarran qualities, including aromas of black olive, herbs and mossy fruit. The palate has good structure, balance and feel, and thus there's a nice platform for dry black cherry, cassis and mocha flavors. As an '05 it's evolved, still fresh enough, and ready to go.",Reserva,89,15,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Piedemonte
45320,Spain,"Crisp, clean and minerally on the nose, with apple and green-fruit aromas. It has a round, smooth feel and flavors of peach, apple and citrus that will enliven the palate and aid almost any seafood, vegetable or salad. A natural wine with just enough powdery sweetness to raise a smile.",NA,89,18,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Nora
45322,Spain,"Very solid and sturdy, with aromas of apple, lemon-lime, soda cracker and mineral. The palate is fuller and more flavorful than your average cava, with candied apple, papaya, lime and lemon flavors. Dry, pithy and hinting at complexity on the finish.",Reserva Heredad,89,25,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
45326,Spain,"A different breed of blended wine, with earthy aromas of dried cheese, leather, dill and vanilla. The palate is tight and mildly tannic, with sweet cola, roasted berry and earthy tobacco flavors. Not your normal bulky, dark wine; it's complex and based on 85% Garnacha and Carignan.",Masia Carreras,89,42,Northern Spain,Empordà,NA,Red Blend,Martí Fabra
45361,Spain,"Minimum was impressive wine in 2003 and it's better in 2004. Cambra's blend of 70% Monastrell and 30% Cabernet Franc is probably the best wine coming from the obscure Valencia D.O. It is generous, balanced, rich and lusty; flavors of blackberry, cassis and plum are succulent and every hole or gap seems filled by tannin, flesh and flavor. Drink now through 2011.",Minimum,92,75,Levante,Valencia,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Rafael Cambra
45422,Spain,"A bit jumbled early on, and then more open and minerally. The palate is chunky but hollow, with melon and green fruit flavors. Finishes with a touch of citrus and a soft, quick fade. Bland but easy to drink.",NA,84,10,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Sauvignon Blanc-Verdejo,Storks' Tower
45426,Spain,"Initially, lemony aromas and flower notes stir interest, while the palate has a medium-to-full feel and pumped-up melon and floral flavors. But with time it grows softer, more pithy and dull. Ultimately it lacks spine and purity of flavors, but how much can you expect from a $10 La Mancha white?",NA,84,10,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Verdejo,Paso a Paso
45429,Spain,"Ripe apple and nutty aromas suggest some light oak, while the palate is wet at first and then more drawn and dry as it moves along. Flavors of apple and spice are mildly alluring, while the finish is chunky and broad. Made from the uncommon Vijiriega grape and hails from Granada.",Veleta Vijiriega,84,9,Andalucia,Vino de la Tierra Contraviesa Alpujarra,NA,White Blend,Dominio Buenavista
45432,Spain,"Opens with dusty dry-fruit aromas along with weight and rubbery notes.

Dry, quick and herbal on the finish.",Tintico,84,9,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo,Castillo de Monjardin
45438,Spain,"Smells like red licorice nibs and stemmy, candied fruit, while the palate is medium bodied, reasonably well balanced and juicy, with berry and plum flavors. It darkens a bit on the finish, where chocolate notes enter the picture. Good for what is a very regular wine.",Rojo Granrojo,84,9,Central Spain,Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Bodegas Navarro López
45441,Spain,"Dark, bulky and fairly oaky for a wine of modest DNA. The palate is forceful, juicy and high in acidity, while the flavors of grape juice and black plum are semisour, with leftover oak and vanilla dominating the finish. An average wine on its best day.",Solnia,84,9,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Ilurce
45485,Spain,"A clean, dry, green-fruited wine that's juicy, citric, tangy and features pure orange, lemon and lime aromas and flavors. It's more of a quaffer than anything complex, but with fish or salads it should be just right. The blend is 70% Treixadura with multiple other white grapes including Torrontés, Godello and Albariño.",NA,88,15,Galicia,Ribeiro,NA,White Blend,Viña Costeira
45581,Spain,"Cassis, raisin, vanilla and rooty spice aromas give this Tempranillo blend some class on the bouquet. It's resiny and fairly heavy feeling, with lightly burnt and earthy flavors of herbal red berry and plum. Dry and peppery on the finish.",Señorío de los Llanos Crianza,85,8,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Los Llanos
45583,Spain,"Full, minty aromas come with freshness and don't overpower. The palate is spunky and offers grabby charge, while wild berry, mint and peppery spice are the main flavors. Dark and warm as it finishes; not a shy wine.",NA,85,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Real Compañia de Vinos
45594,Spain,"This may appeal more to some than others because barrel-fermented Viura is a tough row. Smells a lot like creamed corn or wheat, with apple cider on the side. It's barely acidic enough, thus it's soft in feel and tastes of butterscotch, melon and flabby apple. Seemingly less interesting than in the past.",Fermentado en Barrica,84,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Viura,Finca Nueva
45599,Spain,"Starts out heavy and roasted, with herbal, earthy berry aromas settling in. Feels pruney but there's also acidity, while the flavors run herbal and peppery as prune and plum represent the fruit side. Decent but doesn't fully click.",Dominio de Heredia,84,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Altanza
45666,Spain,"Starts out rustic and leathery, with hints of smoke, leafiness and earth along with baked berry and spice. This four-grape wine has good density and mouthfeel that frames leather, earth and slightly baked berry fruit flavors. Finishes chocolaty and sweet, with just enough acidity to maintain balance.",Selección 12 Crianza,89,15,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Luzón
45667,Spain,"A delicious wine and very much the model for value in Spanish Garnacha. That this has 25% Tempranillo only seems to make it better; the nose is sweet but full and plummy. The palate is pure, flavorful and sweet, with baked cherry, earthiness and a hint of chocolate. A wine to buy in quantity, i.e. by the case.",NA,89,8,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Red Blend,Borsao
45672,Spain,"Sappy green apple, grapefruit and citrus aromas are welcoming and pure, while the palate is soft-edged, citrusy and full or tangerine and melon flavors. A good, honest, clean Verdejo that has sure-fire mass appeal. More solid than special, which is what you should want from this kind of wine.",NA,89,16,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Valdelapinta
45681,Spain,"Nutty and toasty, with toffee and butter pecan aromas. The palate is wet, light, alert and snappy, but also angular and citrusy. The acidity here is key; it pushes dried apricot and tangy flavors toward a nutty finish, and overall the wine delivers what a good, higher-end palo cortado should.",Marqués de Rodil Especial Palo Cortado,89,45,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Palomino,Hidalgo
45683,Spain,"Fragrant, clean and tropical, with slate-driven minerality. The palate is just fleshy enough but mostly it's tight and crisp, with flavors of green apple, fresh green herbs and a drip of honey. Holds it together from front to back; just right for salads and seafood-based tapas.",NA,89,19,Northern Spain,Valdeorras,NA,Godello,Gaba do Xil
45701,Spain,"Prickly citrus aromas are jumpy and a touch sulfuric. This feels leesy, creamy and fat in the mouth, with creamy, tropical flavors of melon and papaya. Bitter flavors of almond and citrus pith vie with lees-based vanilla notes on a round, plump finish.",Blanc,87,16,Catalonia,Terra Alta,NA,White Blend,Celler Bàrbara Forés
45719,Spain,"Clean, fresh, presentable aromas of red fruits are easy to like. This is balanced and offers just enough body to support cherry, nectarine and citrus flavors. The finish is crisp and lingers nicely.",Artazuri Garnacha,87,11,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Rosé,Artadi
45720,Spain,"Sweet, candied, oaky aromas get it going, and the palate, while tannic and tough, is thin in its midsection. Flavors of vanilla and marshmallow lead the way, yet the finish falls off fast. Decent wine but shows a forced, candied, oaky personality.",Tinto 6 Meses en Barrica,84,20,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Alidis
45726,Spain,"Chunky and bold smelling, with bulky berry aromas that are o.k. but not alluring or elevated. The mouth and flavors are more of the same; there's tight, dark, tannic berry flavors along with toast and burnt rubber late. Finishes with mild heat and oak-based coconut notes.",Roble,84,13,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Prado Rey
45731,Spain,"The opening runs a bit sour, tomatoey and stemmy, while the palate offers darkness and weight along with savory, herbal flavors that come across earthy and burnt. Tastes as much like tomato paste and herbs as it does berry fruit. Drink now or let it pass.",Bolanda Crianza,84,18,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Red Blend,Saenz-Olazabal
45733,Spain,"Straightforward and clean, with simple cherry and plum aromas. The palate is tart, juicy and a touch citric, with lightweight cherry skin flavors and a cleansing, fresh, somewhat acidic finish. Tangy and sharp, but not bad for the price.",NA,84,8,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo,Vega Sindoa
45741,Spain,"Not bad for a mass-produced wine. The nose has a distinct sweet, candied character that's like marshmallow, and there's also some burnt stem and bramble thrown into the mix. Tastes mildly pickled, stemmy and burnt, with grabby tannins on the finish. 200,000 cases made.",Roble,84,15,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Protos
45744,Spain,"For $7 this white blend from central Spain does about as well as can be hoped for. Transparent in color, with aromas of children's vitamin and apple, it's nothing special but it is wet, drinkable and tasty. Flavors of green apple and citrus lead to a dry, quick finish.",Protocolo,84,7,Central Spain,Tierra de Castilla,NA,White Blend,Dominio de Eguren
45747,Spain,"Catchy name but the wine is basic. The nose is lightly candied with a bit of green and brine. That pickled character translates to the palate, where flavors of cherry and berry are mildly briney. Finishes similarly, with some reedy heat.",NA,84,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Tempra Tantrum
45845,Spain,"Oily and melony smelling and after that it's pretty much your average, innocuous white wine. Feels like orange juice on the palate and tastes like orange and tangerine. Cleansing, fresh enough and easy to drink.",NA,84,10,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,White Blend,Marqués de Riscal
45953,Spain,"Here's yet another impressive Garnacha-based wine from the traveling Scotsman Norrel Robertson. There's a black-fruit component that's aided by dried oregano, thyme and briar. The mouth, however, is juicy and ripe, with Syrah-influenced flavors of spice and herbs de Provence. Finishes with licorice, pepper and perfect size. The best wine in Robertson's portfolio.",NA,91,21,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Red Blend,Papa Luna
45960,Spain,"Floral fruit aromas suggest blueberry, but overall this vintage lacks the power and depth that Termes and its big brothers are known for. Airing sets up sweet, easygoing berry flavors and full tannins, but in the middle it's less whole than it has been in other years. A juicy, well-made wine that should not be judged as weak just because 2007 was a marginal vintage. Drink now through 2013.",Termes,89,30,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Numanthia
45964,Spain,"Opens with cherry aromas and brightness, then the palate fans out and fattens up with juicy plum and cherry flavors along with just a touch of medicinality. Toasty, warm and tasty, with a thoroughness not usually found in $8 wines. Garnacha at 70% with 30% Syrah.",NA,88,8,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha-Syrah,Coto de Hayas
45974,Spain,"Very smooth with youthful, juicy, fragrant berry aromas along with a bouncy palate full of sweet cherry and cassis flavors. Clean, snappy, alert and healthy. More simple and straightforward than complex, but worth the money and then some.",NA,88,8,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Aletta
45988,Spain,"Yellow in color, with a waxy nose that's baked, rich, a bit stalky but also honeyed. The palate is round, hefty and thick, with full melon and peach flavors in front of a plump, woody finish. Good as you're likely to find among Spanish Chardonnay.",Colección,88,20,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Chardonnay,Viñas del Vero
45990,Spain,"The nose on this Garnacha Blanca is funky and blends aromas of cured ham and salami with lees and citrus. The palate feels right, with solid acidity. Flavors of tangerine, gooseberry and nectarine end pulpy and citric, with a touch of green herbs.",Garnatxa Blanca,87,17,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Garnacha Blanca,Zerran
46023,Spain,"Candied fruit and punch bowl aromas are not what you'd call sophisticated, and the mouth pretty much follows suit with tart, rubbery raspberry fruit that comes on a bit hot and raw. Tough but with full flavor; sort of like chewing on a plum skin.",NA,84,12,Galicia,Ribeira Sacra,NA,Mencía,A Fuga
46031,Spain,"Lean, dry aromas of cherry skins and citrus lead to a competent but basic palate of raspberry and cherry flavors. Everything about this wine screams “regular,” from the tart red fruit core to the tough but fresh mouthfeel to the edgy finish.",Old Vines Crianza,84,13,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Navarro López
46034,Spain,"Vivid pink in color, with dusty, easygoing raspberry aromas. The palate is a bit soft and low in acidity, which indicates that this is the year to drink the wine...and as soon as possible. Flavors of cherry and strawberry are regular, if a touch bitter toward the finish.",Rosado,84,11,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Garnacha,Casita Mami
46038,Spain,"By no means is this the best wine from Pedrosa; it has decent red berry aromas, but what you really get is minty, forward oak. The palate has an acidic tang to it that suggests medium ripeness, while flavors of cherry tomatoes, herbs, vanilla and mint take you only so far. More barrel than substance here.",Crianza,84,NA,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Pedrosa
46040,Spain,"Minty-grassy top aromas indicate that the wine, while endowed with decent berry character, has an herbal side as well. In the mouth, it's hard, lean and compact, with tart cherry/plum flavors and a quick finish. Basic with a touch of sourness.",6 Meses en Barrica,84,12,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Melior
46047,Spain,"Opens with a blast of hot, basic red fruit that's fiery and a little pickled. The palate is lean and acidic but doesn't burn, while the cherry and red plum flavors are elementary. Inoffensive, highly regular red wine.",Rojo Granrojo,83,9,Central Spain,Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Navarro López
46066,Spain,"Aromas of cucumber, mineral and melony white fruits are inviting, while the palate is forward and issues bright, solid flavors of green banana, kiwi and papaya. Well made and friendly for a simple, affordable white Spanish blend.",Sangre de Toro Viña Sol,87,11,Catalonia,Catalunya,NA,White Blend,Torres
46074,Spain,"Opens clean and friendly, with bacon, cassis and plum aromas. The palate is round, fairly large and pure, with tasty black fruit flavors that are sweet, ripe and throw off a bit of licorice. Finishes long, with brown sugar and a hint of toast. Good value Rioja year in and year out.",NA,87,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
46149,Spain,"Mild salinic aromas bring lime and lychee. Feels standard and smooth enough, with sweet white fruit flavors that suggest peach. As a semi-dry, it always feels and tastes sugary.",Carta Nevada Semi Dry,84,9,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
46156,Spain,"Aromas of oil and almond skins leave things in a neutral state. Feels heavy, round and fleshy, with mealy apple and spice flavors. Feels soft, weighty and pithy on the finish. Lacks the vivacity that Verdejo is known for.",NA,84,15,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Viore
46159,Spain,"Basic cherry and red plum aromas are simple and fresh. Feels tight and crisp on the tongue, with an average body and edgy flavors of strawberry and red plum. Lightly oaked and hollow on the finish, with juicy acidity.",Tempranillo,84,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Campellares
46168,Spain,"Smells green and leafy, with tomato leaf, oregano and grassy aromas. Feels clampy and biting, with gritty tannins and roasted, slightly bitter flavors of black plum and pepper. Burnt tasting on the finish.",Old Vines Reserva,84,17,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Navarro López
46271,Spain,"An opening of apricot and peach aromas is proper, while the palate delivers a jolt of zest and acidity to more pineapple, lime and punchy green-apple flavors. Tangy later on, with more than a drop of lemon and lime to the finish. Also slightly pithy and bitter, which is natural for Godello.",NA,88,18,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Godello,Abad Dom Bueno
46276,Spain,"Minerality and crispness define the bouquet, which brings green apple and citrus aromas. There's punch and spritz on the palate as well as sweet citrus and juicy lime flavors that break up a little as they fan out. Not sure if there's residual sugar, but the wine tastes a bit sweet.",NA,88,16,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Lícia
46289,Spain,"Shy at first, with standard raspberry aromas, earth and buttery notes along with cherry and raspberry flavors. Becomes fuller and more satisfying with time, and once it's fully open you have a solid, satisfying Rioja with true flavors and good overall balance.",Crianza,88,14,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Castillo Labastida
46290,Spain,"Same score as the prior year, and pretty much the same wine. It's dusty and slightly burnt in aromas and flavors, with banana, peach and pithy bitterness extending onto the finish. Mouthfeel is the best part; otherwise it struggles to make the cut.",Sauvignon Blanc-Macabeo,83,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,White Blend,Spanish Vines
46293,Spain,"Saucy and jammy initially, and then a raisiny quality takes over. Plump and thick in the mouth, but ultra jammy in terms of mouthfeel. Syrupy and raisiny flavors run the game, and in the end it weighs in as an overripe wine from one of the hottest vintages on record.",Secreto Reserva,83,30,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Mayor
46295,Spain,"Hard and earthy, with black fruit aromas that are big but closed. The palate is short, stocky and blocky, with mammoth but basic flavors that turn rubbery. Not much of a finish to speak of.",Old Vines,83,15,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,El Curato
46301,Spain,"Disappointing given Telmo Rodriguez's overall track record. Dehesa Gago 2008 is jumpy, sweaty and stemmy smelling, with weedy, burnt, acrid flavors. Green, hard and bitter on the back end, with a candied sweetness. Try as we might, we can't find the higher level in this Toro red.",Dehesa Gago,83,18,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Red Blend,Telmo Rodríguez
46304,Spain,"Fairly green, a bit oxidized and old smelling. The palate is short and choppy, with hard leftover tannins and dry, herbal fruit flavors that push up against vegetal. Sweetness re-enters the picture on the finish, but overall this is too dried up and strained to rate higher.",Señor de Cascante Gran Reserva,83,NA,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodega del Romero
46306,Spain,"Briary, herbal aromas bring hints of tomato sauce and burnt leaves to the game, while the palate is fairly innocuous in feel. Flavors of herbal berry fruit and beets are sweet and strained, while the finish hints at green herbs and dried leaves.",Old Vine,83,11,Central Spain,Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Little Chica
46309,Spain,"Leafy, dry and mature, with baked fruit and aromas of dried oregano and basil flakes. The palate has grating tannins, while the flavors are greenish and herbal, with hints of stewed berries and burnt grass. Grabby and stalky; not sure why this old three-grape blend is still on the market.",Reserva,83,25,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Ochoa
46310,Spain,"Banana and green herb aromas make for a challenging nose. The palate has verve and acidity but its flavors of dull white fruits, melon and peach are jumbled. A clumsy mishmash of a wine; 80% Macabeo (Viura) and 20% Chardonnay.",Macabeo-Chardonnay,83,10,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,White Blend,Quo
46316,Spain,"Bell pepper, green bean, green tobacco, tomato and herb aromas carry the nose toward an acid-dominated palate of tomato sauce and herbal fruit. Finishes dry and herbal, and a little bit sour. With 25% Cabernet, this is a small step up from Earth's 100% Tempranillo.",Made With Organic Grapes,83,13,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Earth 3.0
46330,Spain,"This pink rosado is 80% based on Garnacha, and it's attractive, light on its feet and aromatic. In the mouth, it's wide and creamy but healthy, with a chunky feel and enough acidity to propel flavors of strawberry and spice. Smooth and on the full side, but well made and ready to drink.",Rosado,87,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Rosé,Ilurce
46335,Spain,"Clean and smooth to open, with a hint of salinity, powdered sugar and peach. The palate is sheer and zesty, with lemon, green apple and tangy acidity. Crisp yet angular on the finish, but good in a narrow, lean, drilling sort of way.",NA,87,18,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,La Val
46344,Spain,"A snappy, high-acid wine that pulses with red fruit aromas and flavors. It's sheering, which is normal for the Graciano variety, but it also tastes nice while delivering a bolt of raspberry and red plum flavor. Oak comes up late, providing a counterweight of vanilla and dry spice. Nice but like all varietal Gracianos, it's sharp and limited.",NA,87,45,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Graciano,Valserrano
46345,Spain,"Clean, simple and very much in the style that has made Las Brisas a go-to value white. Verdejo, Viura and Sauvignon Blanc are married and happy; the nose delivers peach and green apple, while the palate hits with grapefruit, apple, lime and mineral flavors. Clean, crisp, easygoing.",Las Brisas,87,11,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,White Blend,Naia
46377,Spain,"Ripe peach aromas come with mild oxidized notes and waxy apple scents. This is mouthfilling yet fresh in feel, with punchy acidity. Flavors of baked, spiced apple are a touch briny, and continued similarly to the balanced finish.",NA,87,27,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Garnacha Blanca,Fernández Gómez
46448,Spain,"Pure apple and peach aromas are the calling card of a good Albariño, and Pazo de Senorans always has that and a little more. The '08 seems a touch less concentrated and leesy than prior years, but it's still showing all the marine-influenced personality, beauty and elegance of a no-oak, seafood-friendly winner. Drink right away; it's not meant for keeping. Imported by European Cellars.",NA,91,25,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Pazo de Señorans
46501,Spain,"Smells sweet as cantaloupe, with perfume tossed in. Shows acidity and a smooth bubble wave on the palate along with flavors of watermelon, lychee and cantaloupe. Fresh but quick on the finish.",Opera Prima Pink Moscato,84,8,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Sparkling Blend,J. Garcia Carrion
46509,Spain,"Abnormal by white wine standards, with oily aromas of smoked meat, air freshener and exotic spices. Feels flabby but also dilute, with just enough verve to keep it alive. Flavors of melon and apple are round and spicy, but it's already breaking up and won't last much longer.",Dama de Toro,84,11,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Malvasia,Bodegas Fariña
46522,Spain,"Sweet apple aromas are highly regular, leading to a round palate without a whole lot of sparkle. Tastes tropical and candied, and there's not much to the mild finish.",Reserva Brut,83,15,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Painous
46525,Spain,"Smells a bit pickled and green at first, with a thick and sweet palate that's not easy to wade through. Sweet lime and orange-mango flavors set up a pithy finish.",Spumante,83,9,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
46529,Spain,"Smells like grapey berry fruits and violets. Feels clampy and tannic, with a rubbery mouthfeel and oaky, slightly green flavors of blueberry and black currant. Grainy and grabby on the finish.",NA,83,11,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Sinfonía
46535,Spain,"Opens with a load of sweet, candied black-fruit aromas but this wine excels on the nose because it's composed and precise for being so young and simple in scope. Velvety, rich black-cherry flavors run the show, and the finish brings length and an herbal shading. Very nice for a wine from Toro at this price.",Dama de Toro,88,11,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Fariña
46541,Spain,"Comes out of the chute with some aggression, but that's settled by quality apple and grassy aromas. The palate is jumpy and lively, with pleasant, slightly sweet apple and peach flavors. Shows good refinement, ample layering of flavors and a spot of minerality. As a whole, this is good cava.",Brut,88,17,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Montsarra
46545,Spain,"This is a smooth, subdued style of Rioja that's perfect for tapas or casual consumption. The nose offers the right kind of entry: cherry and raspberry with dusty spice. And the flavors are friendly and suggest black fruits and smoke. A little more oaky and charred than some, but a nice crianza nonetheless.",Crianza,88,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Ramón Bilbao
46547,Spain,"Dusty lemon and cidery aromas are solid and draw you in. The palate has a fresh, clean feel and lively, tangy flavors of citrus, green fruits and green herbs. Zesty, a bit lemony, and nice on the finish. Not a complicated bubbly by any means.",Brut Reserva,88,14,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Sonim
46555,Spain,"Dark and fully oaked Rioja with vanilla, mocha, char and black-fruit aromas. The body is good while the acidity is a bit high, and thus the flavors lean toward tart black cherry and zesty wild blackberry all with a robust amount of toast, spice and charred darkness.",Crianza,88,19,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Obalo
46608,Spain,"Hard, leathery aromas, with an intense but exceedingly tannic palate. Killer bite and raspy, with bitterness and heat. Has decent black fruit flavor but still it's tough and unrefined.",Tres,82,18,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tempranillo,Liberalia
46619,Spain,"Stemmy, pickled aromas send the fruit component to second fiddle. Tastes, smells and feels like a wine that didn't get fully ripe; the flavors are thin and light, with tea and dilute berry. Finishes same as above.",NA,82,20,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Gazur
46633,Spain,"Minerally apple aromas are dusty and yeasty, but straightforward. This feels juicy and a touch plump, with nectarine, citrus and green herb flavors that carry through to the finish.",NA,87,8,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo-Viura,Emina
46651,Spain,"Maybe it's the Viura, becuase this $9 wine seems cleaner, rounder and slightly better than the winery's higher-priced pure Verdejos. Look for generic but fresh peach and citrus aromas and then lip-smacking citrus flavors. Finishes composed and clean, with lasting grapefruit flavor. 60% Verdejo and 40% Viura.",Isabelino,87,9,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo-Viura,Reina de Castilla
46658,Spain,"Earthy and baked on the nose, with rubber, black fruits and warm, almost burnt leather notes. The palate has a lively, dense mouthfeel and flavors of earthy berry fruits and raisin.

46661,Spain,"Minerally, dry and clean white wine made from 60% Xarello and 40% Chardonnay.

Finishes smooth but a little flat.",Petit Albet,87,13,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,White Blend,Albet I Noya
46678,Spain,"Dark and heavily oaked, so if you're into big wines with char, bacon and a lot of spice, this is it...and it's only $14. The palate is tannic and drawing, but lively and loaded with charred, lemony, black fruit flavors. A junior-level, wannabe bigtime Rioja that hints at the region's potential for greatness.",NA,87,14,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Altino
46764,Spain,"Controlled, expressive and impressive for Garnacha. Dark fruit and dark spice are the lead actors, while the supporting cast includes a lush feel and good length. Frankly this is a delicious, well-made Garnacha that pours on the black fruit and brown sugar. Dense and balanced from start to finish.",Gran Viu Garnacha del Terreno,90,60,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Garnacha,Viñedos y Bodegas Pablo
46802,Spain,"Gold in color and lightly oxidized on the nose, and it's still young. Smells heavy and creamy, like hay. Feels flat, with pickled flavors and mealy apple on the finish.

46805,Spain,"Leafy and burnt smelling, with muddled fruit aromas that don't offer much. Feels grabby and tastes mostly of baked berry fruit and bitter spice. Shows some heat and burn on the finish, which is herbal in flavor.",Próximo,83,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Marqués de Riscal
46809,Spain,"Light in every way, from color to bouquet to weight to flavors. Smells like nettles and grapefruit. Feels wet and dilute, with spritz and flavors of grapefruit and melon. Drink chilled or in a spritzer or white Sangria.",NA,83,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Verdejo,Tapeña

46830,Spain,"Brickish in color, with mature aromas of cedar, pine, tobacco, olive and dried fruits. There's still some racy acidity that's keeping the rooty flavors of tobacco, dried berry, coffee and spice moving forward. Finishes dry and a little bit classic; drink now for an affordable taste of Navarra.",Crianza,88,14,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Castillo de Monjardin
46835,Spain,"Crisp and minerally up front, with aromas of apple, peach and dust. It's fresh, maybe a touch basic at its core, with flavors of apple cider, apricot and almond skins. There's nothing not to like about this Albariño, which is pure, pithy on the finish, and more than solid in a pedestrian, familiar sort of way.",Single Vineyard,88,18,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Finca de Arantei
46840,Spain,"Smooth on the nose, with a pinch of rubber, earth, smoked beef and plum/prune. The palate offers structure, solid acidity, zestiness and bright flavors of cherry and raspberry.

46841,Spain,"While I prefer the 2009 for its clarity and freshness, this '08 is no slouching tiger. The nose delivers still-fresh apple and mineral aromas, while the flavor profile leans toward gooseberry, lemon and green melon. Shows some pithy bitterness on the finish, so drink right away or seek out the '09.",NA,88,19,Northern Spain,Valdeorras,NA,Godello,Gaba do Xil
46853,Spain,"Mineral, lime and crisp apple aromas give it a precise, pure nose. And that same character exists on the palate and finish, where white peach, green banana and melon flavors are full and forward. Shows good concentration and quality for a large-production bubbly at this price.",Aria Estate Brut,88,14,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
46890,Spain,"Very strange from the start. Odd stuff, with a candied, spice-like set of aromas that go straight to sweet, dull gumdrop flavors. Feels o.k. on the palate but tastes and smells weird.",Reserva Brut,82,20,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Font I Jordana
46896,Spain,"Simple to the point of being boring. Aromas of generic white fruits don't stand out, while the palate is soft and tastes vaguely of kiwi and nectarine. Finishes flat. Similar to the 2007.",NA,82,13,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Xarel-lo,Sumarroca
46898,Spain,"Aromas of mealy melon, pineapple juice and warm radiator dust do nothing to distinguish this Viura-led white. The palate is clipped and tangy, with citrus flavors leading to a pithy, orange-peel finish.",Viura-Chardonnay,82,11,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,White Blend,No Time
46900,Spain,"Excessive green bean, green tobacco and grass on the nose put this into the “challenged” category. The palate is tart and tomatoey, with herbal raspberry flavors and a leafy, green finish. Barely registers on the pleasure meter.",Made With Organic Grapes,82,13,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo,Earth 3.0
46906,Spain,"Quite dilute, with gaseous, chemical aromas that subside with time but never really leave. The palate is dry, mulchy and briney, and dig as you might, there is never much fruit to latch onto. Too thin, even for a cool year like 2007.",Cosecha,82,15,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Peña Roble
46915,Spain,"Stemmy and green, with herbal, earthy aromas. The palate doesn't offer much besides acid, stemmy flavors and herbal notes, and there's a spot of green bitterness to the finish. Not a lot going on here; acceptable at best.",NA,82,11,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo,No Time
46917,Spain,"Hard and oily smelling, with an acrid overtone. The palate is grating and tastes of bitter, pithy citrus, while the finish is equally bitter, with grapefruit pith lasting too long. Expensive for what you get.",Clarión,82,20,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,White Blend,Viñas del Vero
46925,Spain,"Earthy, meaty and leathery, with an herbal quality to the bouquet. The palate is chunky and soupy, with stewed berry, latent sweetness, and a mild herbal aftertaste. Seems syrupy at points and then fresher and better at other times. Has its good qualities but finishes short.",NA,87,16,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Juan Gil
46926,Spain,"A big, dark, heavily oaked wine with caramel, resin and baked berry aromas. The palate has a thick, meaty feel, slightly abrasive tannins, and then sweet, sticky, woody black fruit flavors. Finishes with brown sugar and more wood flavor; strives for a higher level but gets bogged down with barrel influence.",NA,87,16,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Juan Gil
46932,Spain,"Yeasty, sweet and easy on the nose, with apple, vanilla and pear aromas. The palate has a nice feel and flavors of citrus, spiced meats and baked apple. For basic cava this is focused and forward, with lively acidity and good overall balance.",Brut Reserva,87,12,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Gran Pasión
46980,Spain,"This style of oak-fermented Verdejo probably does better in cool years, which 2009 was not. As a result, this smells a bit oxidized and nutty, with baked apple scents. In the mouth, it is weighty and a touch dull; flavors of butterscotch and cashew finish with cider, salt and buttery notes. Drink now.",Selección Personal Carlos Moro,87,35,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Emina
47053,Spain,"This barrel-aged white Rioja is as close to Burgundy as you're going to find in Spain. It has a lot of oak throughout, but with vanilla, spice, cinnamon and more it works. Apple, baked citrus and resin from the barrel make it complex and food-worthy, and if you were to serve this with grilled or baked fish you could leave the Montrachet for next time. Imported by Maisons Marques & Domaines USA.",Capellanía,90,26,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Marqués de Murrieta
47058,Spain,"A deep and dense wine, with coconut and blackberry dominating the weighty, powerful bouquet. This is an organic wine with an explosive palate of berry fruit and plenty of juicy acidity to keep it fresh and healthy. Toast, chocolate and cola are the finishing notes, and overall it's a strapping wine to drink now thru 2013. Imported by Organic Vintners.",Clos del Music,90,60,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Pinord
47111,Spain,"Reduced and green on the nose, with an overriding aroma of beet juice. Thick and almost cloying, with a jammy, stewy, stemmy set of flavors that finish herbal and green.

47117,Spain,"Smells briney and pickled, much like sauerkraut. The palate has an angular feel, choppy acidity and pickled flavors of apples and wheat. Briney to the max; not very appealing year after year.",Ad Libitum,81,38,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blanco,Juan Carlos Sancha
47126,Spain,"Nice enough on the nose, but like soda in the mouth. Tastes lean and lemony on one take, then like apple cider on the next take. Loses steam as it goes; no lift to the finish.",Brut,81,12,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Gran Pasión

47132,Spain,"Starts out a little gaseous and sulfuric, but it picks up steam in the mouth, where flavors of apricot, citrus and tropical fruits perform a likeable dance. Powerful acidity pushes it in the right direction, and the finish of lychee, passion fruit and nectarine is lasting. Very nice wine but relatively high in price.",NA,88,25,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Mar de Frades
47142,Spain,"Stylistically, this is at odds with what I feel Albariño should be. That said, it's a well-executed and well-made barrel-fermented white with full-force toast and popcorn aromas followed by a resiny, vanilla-fueled flavor profile that folds in apple, banana and creamy frosting. Still vital and healthy after three years in bottle.",Nora da Neve,88,29,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Nora
47150,Spain,"For Navarran Merlot-Cab, Inurrieta Norte is always a winner. This vintage has good darkness along with smooth aromas of black fruit, earth, rubber and spice. It's a bit acidic and shrill as a tasting wine but will do fine at the table. The mouth is spunky and shows slightly herbal raspberry and plum flavors. Finishes light and easy.",Norte,87,15,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Inurrieta
47151,Spain,"For a rosado cava, this offers nice fruit, balance and complexity. The nose is pure cherry and raspberry, but in subdued doses. Meanwhile, it's zesty, foamy and fresh in the mouth, with nectarine, plum, strawberry and prickle. Perfectly nice for everyday quaffing.",Cordon Rosado Brut,87,12,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
47190,Spain,"Lacks freshness; pickled and leathery, with heavy, bruising tannins. Dull, pounding flavors of plum and prune are short and fierce. Rough country wine.",NA,81,9,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Caño
47201,Spain,Seems like it's past its sell-by date. Smells musky and tastes sweet and gummy. Candied papaya and mango is about all you get. Low-pulse stuff.,NA,80,12,Catalonia,Alella,NA,Pansa Blanca,Marqués de Alella
47205,Spain,"Vanilla wafer aromas leave this taster lost. The longer it airs out, the more weird the wine gets.

47207,Spain,"Probably not to everyone's liking, but this oak-fermented Verdejo is a bit like Burgundy and/or white Bordeaux. Cured meat, match stick and pineapple-lemon aromas work their way onto the mildly oaky nose, while the palate has a vanilla-based lushness that works well. Rich, opulent and classy. A sincere food wine.",Hermanos Lurton Cuesta de Oro,91,35,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,J. & F. Lurton

47231,Spain,"Apple and mineral aromas are basic but clean, and the palate is fresh and lithe, with little to no extra weight.

47342,Spain,"A “Wow” type of blended white from one of the modern pioneers of Priorato.

47352,Spain,"The iconoclastic Emilio Rojo produces this five-grape blend from terraced vineyards located in inland Galicia. The wine is lush, rich and shows barrel characteristics and depth.

47368,Spain,"Big, rich and extremely impressive given the price; this wine competes with and beats some Riberas that cost five times more.

47382,Spain,"Nothing if not stout and fruity. This is a big, modern Syrah with a mountain's worth of plum, berry and currant character on the nose, palate and finish. The acidity is a bit jagged and amplified, which creates some crispness, tension and pop. But overall it's a burly specimen that despite 20 months in oak does not taste woody.

47619,Spain,"This white blend from Mallorca is melony up front and, like an island wine is prone to show, saline is all over the nose.

A smooth, creamy finish says drink this soon.",Quíbia Falanis,86,16,Spanish Islands,Vi de la Terra Mallorca,NA,White Blend,Ànima Negra
47626,Spain,"Dusty, leesy stone-fruit aromas form an easy bouquet. Made from the Pansa Blanca grape, this is pulpy and leesy on the palate, conveying creaminess.

47645,Spain,"Earthy, dark and meaty wine, with rubber, deep black fruit, bacon and leather on the nose.

47667,Spain,"Earthy, deep and meaty, with rubber and heft to the nose, but also a ton of black fruit.

47764,Spain,"Lime, citrus and other pungent aromas get it off to a good start, while the palate is wet and fresh, with clean, familiar grapefruit, lime and nectarine flavors.

47783,Spain,"Dry and peppery to start, with muted berry fruit aromas along with wood shavings. The palate is snappy, clean and juicy, with raspberry, vanilla and tobacco-like flavors.

Not a shy wine.",NA,89,15,Levante,Valencia,NA,Tempranillo Blend,El Molinet
47998,Spain,"A big set of roasted aromas includes hints of smoke, mineral, bacon and black fruit.

47999,Spain,"Even in a marginal vintage, you should expect a true and polished taste of Toro from Maurodos's Prima label. Blackberry, cherry and plum aromas are bonded by light balsam-like oak, while the palate is structured and delivers plenty of ripe black fruit.

Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Prima,89,24,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Maurodos
48002,Spain,"On the money right from the start, where deep aromas of black fruits, minerality and fresh herbs mingle nicely.

48038,Spain,"Normally this producer's high-end Sherries are outstanding, but this Amontillado is aggressive and hard, with a clod-like character that starts with molasses on the nose and then turns toward sharpness and bitterness on the palate.

It's clean, lime-tinged and soda-like on the nose, with a correct, no-issues palate that pushes zesty apple along with sweet papaya, mango and banana flavors.

48042,Spain,"Slightly low on kick and bubbles for a blanc de blancs, but the wine's mix of green herb, apple, green banana and melon flavors is good and offers the proper set up to a finish that's citrusy as can be and only slightly pithy.

48050,Spain,"A heavy, slightly strained wine that has a lot in tow. The nose is smoky, rubbery like an inner tube, and a bit herbal.

48052,Spain,"Initially it's rugged, but airing reveals black-cherry aromas and dry spice. The palate is crisp and a little sheer by itself, but the call here is that with food it'll be a winner.

48057,Spain,"Aromas of apple cider and mild spice get it going in a good direction, and this colorfully packaged cava does pretty well in the mouth, where the texture is on the soft side and the flavors of apple and orange run a bit sweet. Not complex but good, fluffy and yeasty.",Lady of Spain Brut,87,15,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Paul Cheneau
48090,Spain,"Sweet and lightly floral on the nose, but also kind of generic and wan. The palate is wet, with hollow white fruit and apple flavors.

48273,Spain,"Smooth and powerful on the nose, with oak-based aromas and clean berry fruit. There's elegance as well as richness to the deep berry, chocolate and vanilla flavors. Finishes with toffee and coffee, but it's not particularly woody even if it is fairly oaky. A decidedly modern and international type of wine. Drink now through 2013.",NA,91,29,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Gancedo
48274,Spain,"This Syrah-Garnacha blend is lush and dense, with attractive licorice and blackberry aromas. It's lusty in the mouth, but balanced as it deals largescale blackberry, pepper, spice and bitter chocolate flavors. Toasty on the finish, with black coffee. A full-bodied winner that's dynamic and overdelivers for the price.",Salia,91,17,Central Spain,Manchuela,NA,Red Blend,Finca Sandoval
48278,Spain,"The bouquet has a distinct lemon, pine and herb element along with black fruit and mocha. It's fairly snappy and tannic, with clipping bite but also fresh, floral flavors of blueberry and herbs. Toasty and long on the finish, with some herbal leftovers and licorice. By all evidence available, 2006 was a great vintage for Bierzo reds.",Art,91,55,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Luna Beberide
48289,Spain,"Rich, earthy and structured, with graphite, bacon and dense black fruit aromas that promise the wine will pack punch. With big, biting tannins, it does that. The palate is dark and tight, with coffee, mocha and tough berry flavors.

48338,Spain,"A touch raisiny and sweet from nose to tail, but what's in between is convincing for Jumilla. Aromas of licorice and herbs are sweet but nice, while the flavors or raisin and blackberry are chunky, with a basic finish that's a little flat but definitely ripe. A blend of Monastrell, Cabernet, Tempranillo and Merlot that's ready to drink.",Taja Reserva,87,12,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Mähler-Besse
48346,Spain,"For Spanish Chardonnay, this is perfectly good and clean. The nose brings your basic set of white-fruit, mineral and fresh herb flavors, while the palate is lively despite some dry, resiny oak flavor. Even with banana, vanilla and creamy flavors, the wine is decidedly not cloying.",NA,87,14,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Chardonnay,Vega Sindoa
48352,Spain,"This winery is known for red Mencía, but this small-lot Godello is perfectly nice and drinkable. It has a neutral nose and a fresh palate of green melon, nectarine and apple flavors.

Finishes dry and peppery, with some toast.",Reserva,87,25,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Dinastía Vivanco
48368,Spain,"Opens with a nice combination of melon, honey and mineral aromas. The wine is fresh and properly acidic, with defined apple, nectarine and melon flavors.

Finishes dry and lightly toasted, with coffee notes.",NA,86,8,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Maximo
48418,Spain,"Opens with sharp cherry, cola and mint aromas. The palate is fairly acidic and sheering, but it's also zesty and fresh, with clean berry and mild raisin flavors.

48485,Spain,"This Verdejo is in its late stages of life but it's hanging in there. Mostly neutral aromas of apple and lime set up a palate with citrusy acidity that keeps the wine alive.

48550,Spain,"Here's a bright, forward, no-issues Garnacha that shows the upside of Calatayud and the grape in general. It's a touch raw and racy, but otherwise it's a nice wine with forward cherry flavors and a lightly charred, earthy finish. Pointed and racy, which is what you want from Spanish Garnacha.",La Multa La Revancha,88,12,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Garnacha,El Escocés Volante
48552,Spain,"Big on the nose, with regionally typical aromas of mineral, black fruit and herbs.

Imported by Grapes of Spain.",NA,88,41,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Genium Celler
48560,Spain,"Expressive white wine from the high plains of central Spain. Pie Franco is one of the more forward, high-quality wines from Rueda.

Round, clean and just crisp enough.",Brut Reserva,87,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
48643,Spain,"Fresh smelling, with notes of green melon, apple, honey and minerals. It's more simple than complex, with crisp apple and orange flavors and then a chunky, slightly pithy finish.

48661,Spain,"A throwback style, with creamy vanilla, dill, tomato and raspberry aromas. The palate is just round and lush enough to not be edgy, but there's ample acid to drive the plum, cherry, cola and raisin flavors toward a clean, linear finish.

48673,Spain,"Starts with aromas of beef jerky, licorice and berry syrup. It's a brawny, dark wine with jammy blackberry flavors along with chocolate cake and thick, grabbing tannins. Finishes sweet and syrupy, with heavy saturation and big tannins. Not in perfect balance and by no means a great wine from Mauro. But it's still good for an off year.

48694,Spain,"A floral, heavy style of blended white made from Macabeo, Gewürztraminer and Chardonnay. It has an exotic streak to the aromas along with smoked ham, fennel seed and gardenia.

48961,Spain,"Sweet, open and floral, like a Malvasia or Moscatel. For a clear, easy quaffer this is nice. It tastes like lime and lychee, and also a little bit like applesauce.

48991,Spain,"This is Luna Beberide's “kitchen sink” blend consisting of Mencia, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. The wine has blackberry and violet aromas, and as a whole it's inviting and smooth. Flavors of berry fruit are solid but modest, while herbal accents and baking spice notes jazz things up. With more follow-through and some artistic touches, this could be even better. As is, it's a perfectly good red blend.",Tierras de Luna,87,30,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Red Blend,Luna Beberide
49000,Spain,"Pedro Ximénez is the grape for this fino-style wine, not the usual Palomino. It's made in the dry style, with peach, papaya and spicy, yeasty aromas.

49135,Spain,"With mineral, apple and peach aromas, this gets off on the right footing. The palate is zesty and acidic, with a tangy set of apple, citrus and mineral flavors.

49184,Spain,"Chunky and rubbery smelling at first, then out comes black fruit, oak and licorice in spades.

Shows basic flavors, normal mouthfeel and scouring acidity.",Brut,86,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Sàniger
49204,Spain,"Opens somewhat clipped and choppy, with citrusy aromas mixed with red fruits. The palate is healthy, lean and acidic, with bright plum and berry flavors softened by some creamy vanilla.

49215,Spain,"Lucid and basically colorless, with flowery, lychee-like aromas that suggest Malvasia or Moscatel.

49227,Spain,"A bit unusual and confusing, but that's because it hails from the Rioja region. The nose is herbal and mustardy, with green aromas leading to a cidery palate of apples and spice.

49268,Spain,"A bit hard and sharp on the nose, but on the plus side it's clean and direct. The palate follows suit; it's reasonably balanced, with forward strawberry, raspberry and mocha flavors.

49271,Spain,"Full and sweet smelling, but also a little cidery. The palate is drawn, narrow and citrusy, with grapefruit, passion fruit and orange for core flavors.

49281,Spain,"Sweet and raisiny, and not in the best shape. This mature Rioja is drying in the mouth and a bit overaged already; it tastes of raisin, coffee and spice, but there's a bit of heat and baked character to it as well.

49304,Spain,"A bit heavy and raisiny, but still this wine gets it right. The body, nose and everything else about it is rich and robust, but while it pushes candied fruit to the brink, it draws back and showcases brandied cherry, toffee, chocolate and other rewarding flavors in a good way.

49315,Spain,"Contino gives its single-vineyard Graciano all that it can, and still the wine, despite its deep purple color, is tight as a drum.

Aromas of roasted meat, compost, leather, berry and plum give it a rugged bouquet, while the superripe palate is big as sin and loaded with ultrasweet blackberry, soy and peppery flavors.

49501,Spain,"Opens with funky aromas of sweaty leather and cheese that seem rustic for this bodega. Time and airing help the wine plenty, and sooner rather than later it shows typical Rioja dried red fruits, earth, tobacco and spice. Astringent and tight as a drum now, but it will evolve in the bottle and should last another two decades.

49587,Spain,"A big, jammy youngster with earth and rubber on the nose. Firm, bullish and tannic but also lively, dark-fruited and touched up with bacon. Finishes with heat and bitterness. Meaty and rugged yet still pretty good.",Manon,84,8,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Mano A Mano
49597,Spain,"A good effort from a weak vintage. This Bierzo has sweet, rich, fulfilling aromas along with a soothing palate that's not overly acidic. As a whole, the wine's cola and blackberry flavors show themselves nicely, while the finish is chocolaty and long. A good wine from a sketchy year.",NA,87,13,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Gotin
49598,Spain,"Granular, edgy and minerally like a daily vitamin tab, this is a sharp-sided white wine with cleansing pineapple, nectarine and lemony flavors in front of a high-toned, mineral-laden finish that is clean and tight. Very fresh, lively and a little more narrow than in the past.",NA,87,19,Northern Spain,Valdeorras,NA,Godello,Viña Godeval
49677,Spain,"Electric pink in color, this is a touch sweaty and funky on the nose, with a prickly quality. Since it hails from Ribera del Duero, it's no surprise that it's fairly full in body. Flavors of nectarine and candied red fruits finish grabby and a touch bitter.",Rosa de Arrocal,84,14,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Rosé,Arrocal
49679,Spain,"Apple, peach and white-flower aromas later suggest dilute pool water. The wine is is tangy and high in malic acid. Sour apple and mixed green-herb flavors finish tart, shear and tangy, with minimal fruit flavor but good crispness.",Barrel Fermented,84,16,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Viura,Muga
49728,Spain,"Sweet and ripe smelling, with licorice and black cherry on the nose. The mouthfeel has a slight astringency to it, but the overall emphasis seems to be on red fruit so that narrowness works. Fresh, quenching and seemingly made to go with foods such as chorizo or fatty Spanish ham. 900 cases made. Imported by Vino Cava.",Selecció +8,87,29,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Red Blend,Finca Mores
49736,Spain,"With its light leafy aromas and spice notes, this wine takes you back to another era in Rioja. It offers traditional flavors of tomato, nectarine peel and raspberry on a dry, juicy palate. Nothing special but perfectly good for fans of classic everyday Rioja wines. Imported by Admiral Imports. Best Buy.",Rioja Bordón Crianza,87,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Franco-Españolas
49771,Spain,"Sort of generic and oily on the nose, with white-fruit aromas that don't fully register. The palate is both spongy and spritzy, with dry, soft flavors of melon and papaya. More fluffy and lush than zesty and precise.",NA,86,14,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Valdelainos
49777,Spain,"Waxy on the nose, with buttercup, creamy yellow-fruit scents and white flowers. The palate is wet, racy and a touch like soda, with sweet, candied flavors of peach and melon. Plods along with good enough acidity to support the wine's core sweetness and candied qualities.",NA,86,15,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Chardonnay,Viñas del Vero
49780,Spain,"Starts with distinct, hard aromas of mustard, horseradish and jerky. In the mouth, it's full, bullish and tannic, with flavors of bacon, wood resin, smoke and stewed blackberry. Very smoky and dark, with hard tannins, and just not as good as past vintages.",Deyo,85,17,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Merlot,Castillo de Monjardin
49791,Spain,"Unusual in that this cava hails from the Ribera del Duero region, where red wines are 99.9% of the show. For a no-dosage nature, it's properly crisp and dry, almost like a liquid version of a soda cracker. There are some holes in the fabric but overall it's citrusy, tight and only mildly bitter on the finish.",Peñalba López Brut Nature,85,16,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Finca Torremilanos
49798,Spain,"Bold, forward and extracted red wine, with raspberry, earth, compost and a light leafiness to the nose. Tannic and tight, with plum and heavy, ripe berry flavors. Toasty and dark on the finish too, with power and freshness.",Tinto,85,12,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Alidis
49805,Spain,"Simply delicious as refreshing, no-oak white wines go. There's telltale grapefruit and stony aromas in front of a pure, easygoing palate endowed with grapefruit, passion fruit and tangerine flavors. Still, it's not overly citric or one-dimensional; excellent Verdejo with a little extra in terms of refinement.",Fuente Elvira,90,17,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Pedro Escudero
49813,Spain,"Dense and roasted on the nose, with tobacco, leather, mild herbal notes and blackberry fruit. The palate is packed but a little bulky, with smacking flavors of plum, blackberry, pepper and herbs. Finishes with leather and heat. Drink now through 2014.",Especial Reserva,90,40,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Palacio
49824,Spain,"One's level of passion for this bulky, hefty Mencía will be largely based on one's appreciation and/or acceptance of heavy oak. The nose is pure hickory, molasses, mocha and coffee, while the chewy, ripe palate deals clove, flowery notes and blueberry flavors. Finishes big and broad, with bacon and barrel resin. Beefy and from the barrel as much as the vineyard; drink now through 2015.",NA,90,48,Northern Spain,Valdeorras,NA,Mencía,Avanthia
49825,Spain,"Very clean and clear, and even though it's a 2009 it is still holding onto its core freshness and character. White fruits and flower blossoms work the nose, and the palate is now fully mature, elegant and smooth. Flavors of peach, melon and kiwi are clean and tasty. Albariño at its best.",NA,90,30,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Lusco
49870,Spain,"Spearmint, bramble and tomato aromas give this wine a mature bouquet. The palate is wide and shows standard leather, berry and tobacco flavors. But it's also a bit tannic, with chocolate, coffee and a grabby feel working the finish. Pleasant and good as a whole, but by no means an overachiever.",Reserva,87,41,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Paramo de Corcos
49871,Spain,"A greeting of toasted nuts and toffee is lifted and sweet, and the palate is quite sweet, with orange marmalade and cinnamon-infused syrup flavors. The finish teeters on cloying as it packs a sweet punch, but there's enough acidity to keep it moving along. Best if you like sweet Sherry.",Medium Amontillado,87,13,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Pedro Romero
49882,Spain,"Sweet with brown-sugar aromas, but the nose lacks more than that. Citrus and other sweet aromas are solid but common, while the feel is good and the finish brings back brown sugar and mocha. Standard; not designed for complexity.","Medium, Rich Oloroso",86,13,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Pedro Romero
49883,Spain,"Hard and closed on the nose, but if you dig there's saturated yet generic dark-fruit aromas and a touch of creamy, lactic oak. The palate offers thick berry flavors and tomato, while the finish is beefy and chewy, with no shortage of tannins. Colorful and bold, but short on polish and expressiveness.",Crianza,86,21,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Recorba
49920,Spain,"Dark and baked on the nose, with rubbery aromas. Strong, strapping and tannic Tempranillo with roasted black fruit flavors and herbal shadings. A rough, tough style with heat and black coffee on the finish.",El Albar Lurton,84,12,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo,François Lurton
49927,Spain,"Smells like air freshener and white flowers. The palate is spongey and a bit low on life, while the flavors lean toward citrus but lack purity and zap, which is further drilled in on the waxy finish. Once upon a time Basa was a leading white value from Spain; lately it has been average at best.",Basa Blanco,84,15,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,White Blend,Telmo Rodríguez
49946,Spain,"Opens with pasty, oaky aromas and very little fruit or clarity. The palate is flat in feel and thick, with woody, medicinal flavors. Finishes with a pile of woodspice and not a whole lot else. Generic and uninspired for the price.",Vendimia Seleccionada,84,28,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Casajús
49948,Spain,"Light on fruit but loaded with mocha and milk chocolate aromas. The palate is lean to average in feel and lightly stewed tasting, with creamy, soupy red berry flavors as the backdrop. Finishes with a persistent baked   flavor and a final dollop of milk chocolate.",Reserva,84,11,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Viña Albali
49969,Spain,"Melon, peach and vanilla-cookie aromas are simple and easy. This is plump in feel but bland on the tongue. Flavors of stone fruits are modest, while the finish lumbers along and lingers with a touch of peach.",Blanco,84,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Viura-Chardonnay,deAlto Amo
50019,Spain,"A little old school with its dill and vanilla aromas and flavors, but with leather, raisin and berry accents and a nice medium-deep body, it more than gets the job done. The palate features herbal plum and berry flavors, while the finish is a bit short on fruit and long on dill. Improves with airing; drink now. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Reserva,87,24,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Valdubón
50023,Spain,"Nice and friendly but also a little flatter than in years past. Aromas of lemon blossom, peach and other white fruits are standard, while the palate is less than edgy, with creamy apple, melon and spun sugar flavors. Sweet and solid, but on the softer side. Drink right away. Imported by Republic National Distributing Co..",Torre la Moreira,87,18,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Marqués de Vizhoja
50025,Spain,"The Crespiello grape isn't one you see often, but it yields a deep, dark style of wine with balsamic notes, fresh black-fruit flavors and weight. This one is almost on the side of cooked, but not quite, thus it blazes a path with blackberry, smoked meat, jerky spice and more. A touch flat but not flabby.",Crespiello,87,52,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Crespiello,Pulchrum
50071,Spain,"Heavy, dark, candied and jammy, with a hint of licorice to the nose. The palate is chunky and concentrated, with meaty berry flavors and a dose of chocolate. Short on the finish, yet fruity if a bit flat.",Spada,85,13,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Bodegas Fariña
50131,Spain,"Full, dark and dense, with blackberry, molasses and bacon on the nose. At first it seems modern and new-wave, but the palate isn't fat and overextracted; instead it's zesty, vibrant and deals pugnacious blackberry flavors topped with spice and chocolate. A lively, forward but manageable wine to drink now through 2014. Only 416 cases made.",Phincas,90,38,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,DSG Vineyards
50136,Spain,"Quite impressive and eyebrow raising for Graciano. The nose is smoky and dry, with raspberry and bacon. In the mouth, acidity is controlled and thus there's no sourness to the plum, tomato, spice and vanilla flavors. Finishes with verve and elegance; a nice potential partner for just about any food. Drink now through 2015.",NA,90,18,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Graciano,Bodegas Ondarre
50137,Spain,"Heavy, oily and well oaked, but also elegant, elevated and something out of the ordinary. This is barrel-fermented Viura at a high quality level; it's smooth, creamy and lifted but also acid-rich and lemony, with notes of toast, vanilla, melon and wood resin. A potentially fine wine to drink now with baked or sautéed fish.",Cosme Palacio 1894 Blanco,90,50,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Bodegas Palacio
50142,Spain,"Unlike TG's Abadía de San Campio Albariño, this wine also features Loureira and Caiño Blanco, and it's more interesting in the long run. Aromas of mango and pineapple are sweet and pungent, while the palate is round, leesy and plump, with green melon, apple, vanilla and creamy notes. Fleshy on the finish, but with good acidity. Will accompany shellfish of all sorts.",O Rosal,90,24,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,White Blend,Terras Gauda
50153,Spain,"Bulky, dark, saturated and leathery on the nose, and then a little salty and edgy in the mouth, with a streak of zingy acidity along with roasted, tangy, thick blackberry flavors. Really good for the price but not as expressive, ripe and flavorful as the 2007 Salia or the higher-end Finca Sandoval; drink now through 2014.",Salia,89,17,Central Spain,Manchuela,NA,Red Blend,Finca Sandoval
50157,Spain,"Opens with alluring, classic aromas of spice, cinnamon, leather, vanilla and tomato along with raspberry. The palate is firm, healthy and dry, with tea, baked berry, dill and cinnamon flavors. Aged six months in American oak, this is a textbook Rioja crianza that's smooth, herbal and on the money.",Belezos Crianza,89,18,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Zugober
50165,Spain,"Prieto Picudo is the grape here, and it's not your run-of-the-mill red variety. The nose is minty green and rustic, and you can tell it's not cut from a common cloth. In the mouth, Carroleon shows cassis and carob, while the finish has chocolate and a medicinal essence. Top-heavy in terms of concentration, with a thin middle tier.",Carroleon,86,32,Northern Spain,Vino de Calidad de Tierras de León,NA,Prieto Picudo,Pardevalles
50176,Spain,"Floral at the edges but dense in the middle, this 920-case wine offers balsam wood, leather and lemon peel aromas in front of sweet, almost sticky cherry and plum flavors. There's wood and resin on the palate, while the feel is saturated and almost candied. A very rich and modern type of Monastrell that should be drunk soon.",Trapío,86,25,Levante,Yecla,NA,Monastrell,La Purísima
50179,Spain,"A good little wine but proof that not all finos are made equally. Pedro Romero is light as day, with almondy aromas and a touch of flower blossom on the nose. The palate is wet, a little thin and entirely basic, with white peach, pepper and a touch of mushroom.","Pale, Dry Fino",86,13,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Pedro Romero
50181,Spain,"Mature and sound on the bouquet, but more snappy and sharp overall than you might anticipate for a 2001. Aromas of tobacco and bramble lead to flavors that you'd expect: more tobacco, dried plum, sour cherries, etc. Long and lean on the palate and finish, with pulse but a shortage of richness. It leaves you wanting more body and fruit.",Reserva,86,49,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Resalte
50187,Spain,"Despite the high price and small quantity (125 cases total), this wine is not performing at an optimal level. The nose, based on 32 months in oak, is drying and minty, with more dill and leather than fruit. The palate, meanwhile, is sharp and elevated by acidity, while the flavors are of tart fruit, tobacco and vanilla. Best with food; drink now because it's not going to improve.",Gran Resalte,86,87,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Resalte
50224,Spain,"Smells roasted and stemmy, with a burnt leaf and turned earth quality to the bouquet. Herbal, scratchy berry and plum flavors feel rough and don't exhibit enough freshness. Simply put: it's a leafy, muddled Ribera wine.",Torre de Golbán Crianza,83,17,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto Fino,Atalayas de Golbán
50228,Spain,"Mealy and heavy smelling, but with decent background fruit aromas and sweetness. Frankly, this already seems to be past its prime, evidenced by creamy, flat flavors of bland fruit and caramel. The finish needs snap and crispness but doesn't have any; a bit too sweet, candied and bitter already.",NA,83,8,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Rosé,Borsao
50238,Spain,"Heavy and nutty, almost like movie popcorn. In due time the nose transitions to creamy berry and cranberry. The palate is soft and muddled, with some citrus and red apple. Sweet and tomatoey on the finish; needs more focus, acidity and dryness.",Cabernet Sauvignon Rosado,83,20,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Rosé,Enate
50239,Spain,"A bit sharp, stemmy and sour smelling. But the fruit flavors are solid and the herbal cherry and plum character that leads the palate improves with airing. Herbal on the finish; standard as a whole.",NA,83,11,Levante,Yecla,NA,Monastrell-Syrah,Evine
50249,Spain,"This warm-climate Viura hits with plodding barrel aromas and flavors but there's not a lot of high-quality natural material to support that much faux/forced oak. Along the way it hints at mealy apple, spice, cinnamon powder and resin. A lot of noise but not much music.",Blanco,83,8,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Viura,Borsao
50262,Spain,"In this very basic wine, applesauce aromas are followed by a plump, somewhat citrusy feeling palate. Flavors of nectarine are good and clean, while the finish is solid.",Tarima,84,9,Levante,Alicante,NA,White Blend,Volver
50277,Spain,"The nose is blowsy and dusty, with waxy white-fruit aromas. The palate is juicy and fresh but doesn't offer much body. Finishing flavors of nectarine, papaya and orange are basic.",Old Vines,84,8,Catalonia,Catalunya,NA,Garnacha Blanca,Ressò
50313,Spain,"Good wine from a very hot year. Early aromas of Band-Aid and barnyard fade with airing, and then forest floor and black fruit step in.

Imported by Vino Cava.",Miros de Ribera Crianza,87,28,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Peñafiel
50334,Spain,"Apparently the allure of Rioja proved too great for the Torres family, because now they have a wine from Spain's signature region. Ibéricos is dark and fruity, with exotic perfume notes and also some soupy qualities. The flavors of strawberry and raspberry have a thick creamy accent, while vanilla and dill are prominent on the finish. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",Ibéricos,87,18,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Soto de Torres
50372,Spain,"Light on the nose, with dilute red-berry aromas and mild leathery, cheesy notes. The palate is kind of raw and lean, with tangy, crisp flavors of pie cherry and raspberry. Dry, peppery, snappy wine, with definitive crispness.",Crianza,85,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Vaza
50390,Spain,"Pale and low on bead, but if you like a Moscato-style wine, this isn't bad at all. The palate is sweet, fleshy and smooth, with lychee and melon flavors. Lively but easy on the finish, with a final wave of lychee fruit and Malvasia-driven sweetness. Unusual but pretty good.",Spumante,85,9,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
50433,Spain,"Floral fragrances from the Gewürztraminer come with honey and leesy aromas. The mouthfeel is creamy and oily, and next up is a melony flavor profile and a smooth finish. Mild on the acidity, so it's in top form now. An exotic, intriguing blend of Gewürz and Macabeo with character; 1,100 cases made.",Treyu,89,16,Northern Spain,Empordà,NA,White Blend,Oliver Conti
50442,Spain,"Smoky, dark, bold and full of black fruit aromas along with barrel notes and a lemony accent. For Prieto Picudo, this is clean, decidedly not funky and lush, with blackberry, spice and barrel resin. Finishes bacony and rich, but not fat or heavy; drink this year and next.",Estay,89,15,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Prieto Picudo,Dominio Dostares
50451,Spain,"Can't call it floral and bright on the nose, but it's not over the hill or maderized, either; more neutral than anything. The mouth is fresh, lively and loaded with lime, green apple and length. Approaching peak maturity and then will start to fade. A smooth operator with depth, minerality and fine acidity.",NA,89,27,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Do Ferreiro
50452,Spain,"Nice and fragrant, with citrus and passion fruit at the heart of the zesty bouquet. Still fresh courtesy of core acidity, with green melon, passion fruit, grapefruit and citrus flavors. Right now it's showing the right blend of maturity and liveliness; a fine Verdejo that may be benefitting from 5% Sauvignon Blanc. Drink this year.",NA,89,14,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Condesa Eylo
50453,Spain,"Creamy and powdery on the nose, with sweetness and leesy notes. The palate is round, smooth and not terribly cutting, while the flavors lean toward honey, melon and another shot of lees.

50454,Spain,"Rich, warm, earthy and fully oaked, with mocha, molasses, blackberry and bacon aromas. The palate is huge but balanced, with clear, ripe black fruit, caramel and vanilla flavors. Modern and chunky but with flow and character; a winner for the price, with a toasty, mocha-driven finish.",Atteca Old Vines,89,16,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Garnacha,Bodegas Ateca
50463,Spain,"Overt on the nose, with a wave of mint, dill and vanilla that come straight from the barrel. Game and leather notes come up later, leading to a palate that blends berry flavors with savory sauciness. Finishing accents of tomato leaf and herbs seal this wine as truly Navarran in character.",Crianza,86,16,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon,Casita Mami
50474,Spain,"Light and rather floral for a Monastrell, with cassis, cherry and leather aromas. It's mildly brambly and not as deep as the 2006 version. Tastes like blackberry and leather, while the tannic grab is strapping. Finishes with a hint of spice and herbs, but also a pinch of bitterness.",Old Hands Organically Grown,86,13,Levante,Yecla,NA,Monastrell,La Purísima
50484,Spain,"Blackberry, plum and earth scents give this wine a darker bouquet than most entry- level 2007 Riojas. It remains solid and full in the mouth, with blackberry, dark plum and charred flavors. Medium length to the finish, with accents of cola and pepper. Good for the vintage; a cut above your everyday Rioja.",LZ,86,18,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Telmo Rodríguez
50528,Spain,"Heavy aromas of orange marmalade and honey come across as unconvincing. The palate follows suit with bland, soft, chubby cantaloupe and green melon flavors. Finishes soft and dilute; seems like it's already dying in the bottle.",NA,83,13,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Vega Murillo
50530,Spain,"Rough and leathery, with roasted black fruit and burnt-leaf aromas. The palate has a clacky, sharp feel and flavors of dried, baked berry fruits and leaves. Hard, roasted and leathery red wine.",Crianza,83,11,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Albali
50536,Spain,"Lean raspberry and cherry aromas are the best part because the palate is rather raw and acidic, which causes raspiness and a tough mouthfeel. Flavors are sharp and red fruited, and there's an oak and vanilla element that's not that well integrated.",Selección,82,9,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo,Fundatio
50537,Spain,"Expensive for what you get. The nose is a weird mix of salami and sweetness, and the palate is a syrupy, globular blend of cloying oak, caramel syrup and candied banana. Way too much wood and vanilla here, and not nearly enough balance or purity.",Blanc de Montsalvat,82,40,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,White Blend,Francesc Sanchez Bas
50541,Spain,"Smells lightly burnt and acrid, with stemmy berry aromas, apricot and match stick. The palate has a flat, creamy feel and stemmy, dry flavors of generic berry and bitterness. Too flat and devoid of fruit to rate higher.",Viña Main Rosado Tempranillo,82,12,Central Spain,Vinos de Madrid,NA,Rosé,Bodegas Orusco
50542,Spain,"Sharp, rubbery, stemmy aromas lead to an edgy palate with herbal, burnt, semigreen berry flavors. Finishes green and a bit weedy; acceptable but nothing to get excited over.",Clave del Secreto,82,9,Levante,Alicante,NA,Monastrell,La Bodega de Pinoso
50572,Spain,"Aromas of saline, oily white fruits and swimming pool unfold on the nose. This feels oily and tastes pickled, with bitter notes, green herbs and mild stone-fruit flavors. The gripping finish tastes pithy.",NA,83,16,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Miguel Arroyo Izquierdo
50577,Spain,"Pungent, sweaty aromas of nettle and cactus suggest capsicum. Citric in feel, the palate offers grapefruit and mild bell pepper flavors. This is Tempranillo with 20% Verdejo.",NA,83,11,Northern Spain,Cigales,NA,Rosado,Val de Los Frailes
50615,Spain,"An interesting if not exactly perfect Cab Franc from central Spain. It has some of the grape's typical leafy dampness but in the mouth the wine is bright and brutally tannic, with blackberry, plum and cassis flavors. Ripe, chewy and meaty, with plenty of power and fruit but not a ton of finesse.",El Cabernetf de Chozas Carrascal,87,49,Levante,Utiel-Requena,NA,Cabernet Franc,Chozas Carrascal
50623,Spain,"Lively right off the bat but also sort of jumbled and cheesy. The palate features red-fruit flavors and candy, while the finish is aggressively racy and a bit raw.

50632,Spain,"Dusty and floral on the nose, with tropical fruit aromas and a touch of nut oil. A blend of 60% Verdejo and 40% Viura that is wet, fresh and healthy.

50692,Spain,"Smells oily and a little burnt and acrid, with fleshy flavors of banana, melon and bitter pith.

50740,Spain,"Almondy and smoky on the nose, which is a textbook combo for this variety. The wine was 50% barrel-fermented, but it's not a woody, toasty product.

Decidedly not bitter, with honey and light notes of vanilla on the finish.",Blanc dels Aspres,89,28,Northern Spain,Empordà,NA,Garnacha Blanca,Vinyes dels Aspres
50744,Spain,"Smoky and dark, with aromas of salami, rubber, baking spices and prune.

50748,Spain,"Starts out a bit rough and horsey, but let it air out and escape from the bottle and this Tempranillo-Cabernet blend struts its stuff. There's impressive core blackberry and raspberry flavors along with minerality, crustiness and structure. Tight on the finish and still youthful, with rugged tannins and power to spare. Very nice for a 65,000-case product.",Crianza,89,20,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Enate
50753,Spain,"Dark to the eye, with bacon, ham, spice and savory fruit aromas. The palate is extracted and grating in feel, with dark berry, herb, pepper, smoke and barrel resin flavors. Spicy on the finish, with a blast of clove and cardamom. Very good but not as filled out as in prior years.",Tinto Figuero 12 Crianza,89,29,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,García Figuero
50759,Spain,"Superclean and inviting on the nose, with lemon, melon, apple and stony aromas. The palate has a round, pleasant, chiseled feel and flavors of green fruits including kiwi, honeydew melon and apple. Turns a bit sweet on the finish, but not sugary. Really nice for $15 Spanish Chardonnay.",NA,89,15,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Chardonnay,Viñas del Vero
50765,Spain,"A mixture of celery root and sweetness makes the nose a little confusing. The wine is typically acidic, with simple mushroom and salinic flavors. Distant on the finish, with some blocky heft. Not quite as smooth, simple and easygoing as a manzanilla should be.",Manzanilla,85,10,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L.
50766,Spain,"Intense and frisky, with mild green-herbal aromas standing out on the nose. Like any varietal Graciano, the wine is shrill, with acidity pushing the tart side of the huckleberry and blueberry fruit. Lean at the end, with little richness. Best for die-hard Rioja buffs and fans of acidic red wines.",Inspiración Valdemar,85,95,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Graciano,Bodegas Valdemar
50768,Spain,"Light spice notes and jammy berry aromas are about all you get from this Prieto Picudo-based wine. The palate is sheering in feel, with cherry, plum and apple skin flavors. Just weighty enough, with a juicy profile and finishing flavors of cola and lean red fruits. Drink now.",Gamonal,85,24,Northern Spain,Tierra de León,NA,Prieto Picudo,Pardevalles
50775,Spain,"It's cheesy on the nose at first, with black fruit, molasses and leather coming later. Baked and warm on the palate, and then loud due to a heavy mouthfeel and a strong raisiny quality. Rich, sweet, wayward and incongruent. Has its moments and also its pitfalls.",NA,85,24,Central Spain,Mentrida,NA,Red Blend,Alonso Cuesta
50779,Spain,"Woodsy at first, then more foresty and stretched. The nose is peppery and light on fruit, while the palate shows tight cherry and raspberry flavors alongside edgy, invigorating tannins and acidity. A lively wine with bite and modest offsetting sweetness to the overriding snap.",Reserva,85,18,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Valserrano
50821,Spain,"All indigenous grapes are welcomed by our tasting panel, but sometimes they are unknown and little used for a reason. This wine, made from the local Maturana Tinta, is a green, mean, lean wine with herbal aromas and flavors that, let's face it, are vegetal. Tastes tart and short, with a strong, driving green character throughout.",Ad Libitum,82,40,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Maturana,Juan Carlos Sancha
50829,Spain,"Dusty, sweet and gummy on the nose, and not very vital. The palate is chunky and dull, with mealy white fruit flavors and a bit of fino sherry or manzanilla. Made from the Malvar grape, and the result is strange and lazy.",Viña Main Blanco,81,12,Central Spain,Vinos de Madrid,NA,Malvar,Bodegas Orusco
50832,Spain,"Raisiny and thin smelling at the same time. The palate is dilute, citric and sheering, with tangy red currant and citrus flavors. Acidity keeps it vital but there's little flavor, body and structure. Ends up thin and sour.",Viña Honda Crianza,81,20,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Silvano Garcia

50835,Spain,"There's a reason Airén is used as a base grape for brandy and Sherry wines, and it's because it's not up to table-wine quality, even at the value price point. This wine is corny and lacks freshness. It's dull, wayward and offers little to no structure. Barely drinkable.",Airén,80,9,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Airen,Sierra Virgen

50854,Spain,"Briny aromas of gooseberry and citrus are a touch sweaty. In the mouth, this is medium in weight. Flavors of briny grapefruit and other citrus fruits finish similarly.

50867,Spain,White-flower aromas and little more define the nose on this bland wine from hot Jumilla. A flabby mouthfeel sets up green banana and pyrazine-based flavors. Papaya is the only discernible flavor note on an otherwise soft and creamy finish.,Luzón Blanco,83,10,Levante,Jumilla,NA,White Blend,Bodegas Luzón
50872,Spain,"This strange, floral-smelling Chard seems more like Gewürztraminer. It's creamy and cloying in the mouth, with spicy, sweet flavors of anise and lychee. It's particular and unique, but not very good.",234,82,15,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Chardonnay,Enate
50944,Spain,"Sweet black fruit, road tar and a whiff of grass makes for an interesting, attractive nose. With its medium body and medium depth, the palate shows cherry, cassis and tomato flavors, and the finish offers a rush of red fruit, tannin and brown sugar. While this doesn't bowl you over, it's good Spanish Cabernet Sauvignon, something you don't find every day.",Pi del Nord,87,50,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pinord
50948,Spain,"This warm-vintage crianza has earthy black-cherry aromas along with leather, mineral and bacon.

50953,Spain,"There's no shortage of power here. Forward berry aromas mixed with earth and leather ring true, while the palate is layered, broad, chewy and offers bright cherry and plum flavors.

50956,Spain,"Nothing wrong with this crisp, tight number from Rioja. It's so clear in color that it's almost translucent, but the palate has good flavors of kiwi, green melon and lime.

50964,Spain,"Dark and deep, with cola, black fruit and truffle aromas. There's good lift to the palate, but overall it has to be classified as a dense, warm-climate wine with a big body and equally large flavors of black plum, olive and coffee. Seems short and a little simple on the finish.",Uno,87,40,Levante,Valencia,NA,Monastrell,Bodegas Rafael Cambra
50965,Spain,"A bit rubbery and smoky on the nose, with some hardness. Airing reveals raspberry and vanilla aromas, while the palate carries some jolt due to sizable acids. Tastes like a burst of red plum and pie cherry, while the finish is tannic, long and full of leftover red fruit. More than respectable for La Mancha Syrah. Imported by North American Beverage Group.",Baldor Tradición,87,23,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Syrah,Bodegas y Viñedos Castiblanque
51010,Spain,"A bit flat and jammy on the nose, and then it runs hot and heavy across the palate, where the flavors waver between citric and plum-cherry. There's a lot of fruit here, but also some burn and finally a dull hum to the finish.",NA,84,9,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Tienen Duende
51018,Spain,"Earthy but sharp on the nose, with a foreboding sense of stem and sourness. The palate is indeed raw and acidic, with lean, slightly stemmy flavors of herbs, raspberry and plum.

51031,Spain,"Opens with vanilla and minerality along with standard apple and peach aromas.

51035,Spain,"Clean, minerally and smooth, with nothing more than crispness and apple to the nose. The palate is easygoing, while the flavors of peach, pear and apple are boosted by minerality and good acidity.

51057,Spain,"Easy, chiseled and refreshing stuff from Catalonia that's 50% Macabeo and 50% Sauvignon Blanc, by no means a common combo in Spain.

A simple wine that delivers what it should.",NA,85,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Darien
51071,Spain,"Licorice and other sweet, dark, unusual aromas set this Syrah on its way. Flavors of raisin and fig tell you that it's ripe, but the mouthfeel is controlled by sharp, wayward acidity.

51072,Spain,"A nose of sweet cherries and raspberry is limited due to some damp funk, but with time the wine shows unimpeded freshness and pretty good blackberry flavors.

Fresh, tasty and uncomplicated.",Rojo Granrojo,85,9,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Navarro López
51075,Spain,"This unusual blend of Merlot, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon is a bit strange, but it gets our attention for being unique. The nose is ripe and medicinal, with spearmint, carob, vanilla, berry and candy aromas. In the mouth, it's big and creamy, with sweet, sticky black-fruit flavors and a spread of butter.

51259,Spain,"Always consistent is Blanco Nieva's Verdejo. The nose is clean and inviting, with apple and pineapple aromas.

Imported by Frontier Wine Imports.",NA,87,16,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Blanco Nieva
51260,Spain,"This wine impressed us more now than when we tried it last year. It is showing commendable intensity and concentration, and while it seems slightly medicinal, it brings on the plum and baked-fruit flavors.

51261,Spain,"Sweet and fragrant, with off-the-grid aromas of blueberry and exotic spice. It's 50% Monastrell along with 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Tempranillo, and overall the wine has healthy acids, a hot finish and spicy flavors of brandied cherry and plum. Thick and substantive, but a little fiery.",Viña Honda Crianza,87,20,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Silvano Garcia
51274,Spain,"A bit tan and dull to the eye, with neutral aromas of apple cider and peach. The palate is wet, uncomplicated and simple, with basic apple flavors that some might consider to be bland. Solid on the finish, with papaya for flavor.",NA,84,8,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Viura-Chardonnay,Vega Sindoa
51330,Spain,"For a bargain-priced red, this is not bad. The nose is baked and mellow, with a whiff of barnyard.

Good for basic wine.",Red Wine,84,8,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo-Merlot,Vega Sindoa
51331,Spain,"A mix of raisiny aromas and grass notes gives this wine a green sort of bouquet. The palate is chunky, with thick berry and plum flavors that are good if not put under the microscope. More voluminous than precise, with big tannins and a “country” sort of personality, meaning it's fruity and big but not that refined.",Roble,84,15,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Tres Carros
51342,Spain,"A true but basic Rioja with chewing gum and dark fruits to the nose.

51349,Spain,"If you catch this before it fades, it won't be a bad little Catalunyan rosé.

Imported by Freixenet USA.",Mediterranean,84,6,Catalonia,Catalunya,NA,Rosé,René Barbier
51351,Spain,"Raspberry and citrus peel aromas lead to a stark palate of red fruit and citrus flavors. This is a lip-smacking, acid-driven wine with minor hints of toast and coffee on the finish.

51355,Spain,"Edgy cherry and raspberry aromas carry a bit of rhubarby sharpness, while the palate is bright, clangy and simple. This is a fresh, no-fuss wine that pulls no punches.

51358,Spain,"Rather stemmy on the nose for a $50 wine, while the palate is sheering and firm as nails, with licorice and a forced sweetness that starts as blackberry and turns to licorice.

51402,Spain,"Full and dark, with a bouquet that offers hints of cheese, rubber and stocky black fruit. The palate is big, layered and grinds a bit due to rugged tannins and lively acidity.

A little biting but still nice.",Lui Selection Crianza,88,18,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tempranillo,Abelis Carthago
51408,Spain,"Expensive for what is ultimately a crisp, clean but limited white wine from the Basque country.

Nice but definitely drink soon.",Tres Olmos,88,17,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Garciarévalo
51456,Spain,"Smoky berry, lemon peel, graphite and huge black-fruit aromas provide a stellar opening. Raw tannins and staunchness create a powerful palate that needs time to mellow out.

Best Buy.",NA,87,9,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Marqués de Cáceres

51652,Spain,"The year 2007 is not going to go down in the books as a good one for Ribera del Duero. Many of the young wines, like this one, are showing narrow, sour fruit and too much funk and pickle.

51704,Spain,"Hot and roasted on the nose, but still interesting and suggestive of high quality. The palate is very rich and sweet, with candied, ultraripe flavors of berry, fig paste and chocolate. Maintains that sweet, baked character onto the finish, which is mature and soft. Drink now.",Varietales Dos Mil Cuatro,88,65,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Red Blend,Enate
51709,Spain,"Starts out kind of raw and cutting, with oak, soy and spiky black fruit aromas. The palate is round but features kick, while flavors of cola, mocha and chocolate sit on top of earthy berry. An oaky wine, especially on the finish. But it's also deep and generous. Drink now.",Tierra Crianza,88,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Agrícola Labastida
51714,Spain,"A little foxy at first, with lively, forward aromas of herbs, bramble, wild berry and black cherry. Doesn't take long in the glass to show its qualities, which include structure and plenty of fruit, herbs, pepper and dry spice on the palate. A voluminous, interesting Garnacha to slot into the everyday category.",NA,88,11,Central Spain,Almansa,NA,Garnacha,Higueruela
51752,Spain,"Fans of full-bodied, dark-fruited reds will swoon over this modern-style Garnacha from old vineyards in Aragón. Pitch black, the nose provides a pure blast of blackberry and cassis, and the palate is chewy yet fresh, with baked black-fruit flavors as well as coffee, chocolate and vanilla. A smooth, lush, layered finish with vanilla and toffee notes is the final act. Drink through 2017.",NA,94,48,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Alto Moncayo
51766,Spain,"With its opaque black color and massive yet alluring aromas of blackberry and black currant, this whopper is on the money.

Drink through 2017.",Prados PdM Moncayo,93,38,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Red Blend,Pagos del Moncayo
51779,Spain,"Dense intitial aromas suggest rubber on top of blackberry. In the mouth, this Tempranillo is deep as a trench, with layering and firm tannins.

51843,Spain,"Dry and fiery, with leaf and herb aromas going head to head with light raspberry.

Imported by Frontier Wine Imports.",Vendimia Seleccionada,86,32,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Heras Cordon
51848,Spain,"By no means is this an easy wine to like or understand. It begins with murky, earthy aromas and then unfolds to deliver marzipan and sweet berry fruit. Massive is an understatement, as the wine's tannic grab and density are over the top. There aren't many good high-priced Cabs from Spain; take this as a good explanation why not.

51849,Spain,"Pungent and sweaty smelling, and even though it's 50% Verdejo and 50% Viura, it's the Verdejo that stands out.

51858,Spain,"Darker, denser and more raisiny than your average varietal Graciano, this wine is almost pruney and horsey.

Imported by Baron Francois Ltd.",NA,86,23,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Graciano,Viña Ijalba
51864,Spain,"Get at this wine while it's still fresh and you'll likely enjoy its pineapple, apple and mango essence.

51871,Spain,"Reddish in color and devoid of a visible bubble bead, this Garnacha-Monastrell cava is lacking in many ways.

51962,Spain,"The first 2007 reds from Spain are now appearing, and it seems like talk of a tough vintage are being confirmed. This wine is sheer and miserly.

51970,Spain,"Neon pink in color with watermelon and candied raspberry aromas. But from there it goes nowhere; the palate is watery and tart, with sour strawberry and raspberry flavors.

51973,Spain,"A tart, foxy style of Rioja with sharp-edged aromas. The palate is crisp as ice chips, with lean, leafy flavors of pie cherry and raspberry. Tight on the finish, with a lasting scratch of peppercorn and acidity.",Antaño,82,8,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,J. Garcia Carrion
51979,Spain,"Harsh and burnt-smelling, with beet-like flavors and too much body weight.

Past its prime with nowhere to go.",NA,81,16,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Rosé,Fra Guerau
51983,Spain,"Aromas of cabbage, tomato leaf and green berry fruits tell you all you need to know.

Just one of a million weak wines from the high plains of Spain.",Quixote Merlot-Tempranillo-Petit Verdot,81,25,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Red Blend,Pago Casa del Blanco
51985,Spain,"An aggressive wine with very little charm or character to back up its edgy verve. The nose is skunky while the palate tastes of pickled red cabbage and sharp berry flavors.

52066,Spain,"Nearly seven years after harvest, it remains lively and vital. Pointed aromas of lemony oak, pencil lead and cassis are classy and a touch earthy.

52161,Spain,"An interesting white wine based on Chardonnay and Xarello. It's like Cava without the fizz, and the nose starts out dry and like Sherry before green apple and lime come into view.

52295,Spain,"Hailing from a 3-acre old-vines vineyard, this fully oaked Rioja blend is toasty to the max but hits with intensity, acidity and depth on the palate.

53226,Spain,"Mocha and vanilla stand out courtesy of three months of barrel aging. There's also solid red fruit aromas below the outward oak. The palate has lift, freshness and flow, while the flavors of plum and berry are nice and show a creamy vanilla side. 75% Monsatrell and 25% Syrah.",Barrel-Aged,87,13,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell-Syrah,Genio Español
53238,Spain,"Fresh, crisp and oceanic in style, with green apple and lime on the nose. This is a juicy, sheer style of white wine from northern Spain that's all about freshness, high acidity, citrus and green notes. It's not complicated but it will go well with seafood and salads.",NA,87,20,Northern Spain,Bizkaiko Txakolina,NA,Hondarrabi Zuri,Itsas Mendi
53241,Spain,"A perennial Best Buy Rioja white that never deviates from the formula, which includes crisp aromas, fresh white fruit flavors and just enough sweetness so it doesn't come across tart. With proper acidity and weight, it hits the spot.",NA,87,9,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Viura,Marqués de Cáceres
53264,Spain,"This Syrah is big, rubbery and heavily charred on the nose, with iodine and minerally notes kicking in. The palate is deep but not too heavy, with juicy acidity.

53268,Spain,"Ripe blackberry and cassis aromas are pure and lusty. In the mouth, it shows chewy tannins, a stout structure and generous flavors of blackberry, chocolate, pepper and a spot of salty brine. A toasty, dark, heady finish confirms the overall quality. Drink through 2020.",Vendimia Seleccionada,91,30,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Viña Mayor
53348,Spain,"Clean as polished glass, with touches of red plum and cherry on the nose. The palate is fresh and balanced, but basic and moderate in terms of flavors.

53352,Spain,"If basic Argentinean Torrontés is to your liking, so will this be. It's fresh and green on the nose, with melon and lychee aromas. Those fruits carry onto the palate, where lemon-lime and crystallized mango flavors are sweet but crisped up by snappy acidity. Serve chilled. Imported by Frontier Wine Imports.",Viura & Chardonnay,85,11,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,White Blend,Ochoa
53361,Spain,"Big and baked, with aromas of cheese and leather offsetting sweet black fruit. Flavors of cola, blackberry and chocolate are as baked and sweet as the nose, and the feel is grabby and leaves a sugary residue on the finish. Wants to be a modern, ripe wine but proves to be simple and overdone. Imported by The Portfolio Group.",Crianza,84,22,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Baigorri
53363,Spain,"Aromas of barrel spice and grilled pineapple are solid, while the palate is thick and creamy with orange marmalade and banana flavors. If you like a thick, unctuous Chard with a glob of oak, this is it. Has its strong points but tastes too much like cinnamon stick and wood. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",Vinya Gigi,84,24,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Chardonnay,Jean León
53366,Spain,"Spice and leather aromas are positive while the smells of burnt leaves and green herbs aren't too appealing.

And the finish evaporates fast, leaving heat and medicinal notes.",Proyecto Cu4ro,84,12,Catalonia,Catalunya,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Concavins
53367,Spain,"Minty smelling, with herbal red fruit and rhubarb scents. The wine is clack, clack, clack on the palate as acids and snappy red fruit draw everything down to the base level. Flavors of raspberry and light vanilla are clean but high-toned, and there's an undercurrent of tomato. A tough wine from a vintage to forget.",Reserva,84,25,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Casa de la Ermita
53369,Spain,"A touch green and grassy at the start, with cinnamon, cherry candy and red-fruit aromas. The palate is fresh and snappy, with sweet berry flavors and just a slight bit of resin and/or green character. Finishes light and quick, making it an easygoing red wine that isn't meant for deep analysis.",NA,84,9,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Garnacha,Lelia
53472,Spain,"Hailing from the hottest vintage in years, this is round, rubbery and showing sweet, rooty aromas of root beer, cola, mocha and stewed plum.

53475,Spain,"On this medium-bodied, sweet Moscatel, the tangerine peel and lychee aromas require airing to get beyond the basics.

53479,Spain,"Jammy berry aromas are fiery and aggressive. In the mouth, this is sticky in feel, with huge, grabbing tannins and blocky ripeness. Chocolate and vanilla drape overripe black-fruit flavors, while the finish is heavy, chewy and tastes like fudge. Drink this forceful, oaky RDD now through 2020.",Valdegatiles,91,125,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto Fino,Dominio de Atauta
53551,Spain,"Round and good by Rueda standards, with melon and peach aromas but not too much citrus. The palate is full and chunky, with papaya, melon and a touch of pithy bitterness. More regular than special, but good and goes down easy before finishing dry.",Solo,87,14,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Oro de Castilla
53553,Spain,"Hard to complain about a fresh, basic white wine like this. It's juicy and pleasant, with melon, citrus and nice acidity.

53557,Spain,"A little stalky on the nose, with basic red fruit aromas. The palate is crisp and snappy, with citrus and plum flavors and pretty nice depth. Fades out with zesty orange and raspberry, leaving some tang on the tongue.",Cuvée Rosado Brut,87,19,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Trepat,Castillo de Perelada
53560,Spain,"Opens with pleasant, traditional aromas of dried red fruits, spice and citrus peel. The wine has a mature feel with tomato, dried currant, raspberry and light mocha flavors.

53561,Spain,"Lemon, buttercup and apple aromas produce a delicate nose. The palate is smooth but soft, with only a modicum of minerality. Tastes sweet and melony, with equally sweet pear and apple flavors in the background. Falls off on the finish, where the acidity is low. Drink now.",NA,87,22,Northern Spain,Valdeorras,NA,Godello,Casal Novo
53562,Spain,"Nice Garnacha and Tempranillo that's mature and ready to go. The nose is earthy, spicy, peppery and round, while the palate has a solid, healthy feel to it and flavors of dried berry fruit, fresh tomato and herbs. A little roasted at its core, but good overall.",Crianza,87,10,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Red Blend,Coto de Hayas
53566,Spain,"Slightly roasted on the nose, with aromas of blackberry and a penetrating grassy note. The palate is authentic for RDD, with clipped, herbal flavors accenting soupy berry and bouillon. Finishes earthy, meaning there are leafy notes and dryness.",Torre Albéniz Reserva,87,50,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Finca Torremilanos
53571,Spain,"With its apple, peach and melon aromas, the bouquet is solid. The palate is a bit spritzy and spread thin, and that's confirmed via fleshy, dilute flavors of white peach and green melon. Plump and simple on the finish; good for salads, shrimp and grilled white meats.",NA,87,15,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Lícia
53574,Spain,"One taste and you can see the correlation between this Priorat dry PX and certain fino-style Sherries. It's nutty and dry as a bone, with almondy aromas. Crisp acidity provides backbone and the flavors of barely sweet pear, apple and white peach are fully dry and don't push the envelope. Clean but limited in scope.",Ximenis,87,40,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Pedro Ximénez,Genium Celler
53672,Spain,"A tiny bit earthy and peppery, with solid berry fruit aromas. The palate is sappy and medium-weight, with red-fruit flavors dominated by raspberry.

53673,Spain,"Definitely sweet, syrupy and raisiny. Torres has made a chunky, plodding wine with saturated berry and plum flavors but hardly any of the mineral, schist, zest and excitement the Priorat is renowned for. Deep, dark and dense for sure, but ultimately flabby and mediocre. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",Salmos,84,37,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Torres
53678,Spain,"Stretched on the nose, with reedy, wiry, candied red-fruit aromas. Quite tannic and a bit syrupy in the mouth, with ultrasweet berry flavors and then a scratchy, forward finish. Has its merits but seems out of place and pushy for Spain. Imported by Classic Wines, Inc.",Hacienda,84,14,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon,Casa del Valle
53686,Spain,"A decent old-school throwback, with dried spice, pepper and slight red-fruit aromas followed by a light-bodied palate of plum and raspberry. While it's mostly lean, there is the smallest note of caramel and toffee to the finish. Drink now.",Tierra Serena,84,10,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,Artiga Fustel
53693,Spain,"A fleshy, simple wine with gumball aromas. The palate is chubby but not all that structured, with plump but basic berry and plum flavors. The finish shows some blackberry but not much else. Good and generally clean, but rudimentary. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",Crianza,84,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,CVNE
53694,Spain,"Starts out pretty good and fruity, but becomes more challenged with time. There's a truckload of early raspberry fruit, but it turns more sharp and piercing the more time it sits. Lengthy and potent, but not elevated.",NA,84,12,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon,Finca Antigua
53695,Spain,"Sweet and syrupy, with molasses on the nose. On one hand it's rich, ripe and flavorful, but also cooked, lumpy and heavy.

53790,Spain,"Meaty, rubbery aromas of berry fruits come with hints of minty green and lemony oak.

53794,Spain,"Ripe blackberry, graphite and tobacco aromas become oakier with airing, making resin, vanilla and mocha notes rise up.

53805,Spain,"Rusty and mature looking, this is woodsy, dry and rooty on the nose, with whiffs of tree bark and tobacco running alongside cherry and berry notes.

Drink now.",I Gran Reserva,91,38,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Faustino
53813,Spain,"This dense, purple wine is packed with roasted, charred aromas of burnt toast, espresso and plum. The palate is creamy and smooth, with good core acidity.

53853,Spain,"Zesty, edgy red berry aromas are bright, scratchy and sweet. The palate is healthy, balanced and creamy, with juicy, slightly candied flavors of red berry fruits and herbs.

53858,Spain,"Earthy and oaky, with toasty heft, spice and a heavy sweetness to the nose. In the mouth, it's jammy and rich but also slightly soft and flabby, with baked, concentrated, sweet flavors of blackberry, caramel, coffee and prune. Spicy and sweet on the finish; drink sooner rather than later.",Old Vines,87,30,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Prieto Picudo,Tritón
53862,Spain,"Punch bowl aromas of pineapple, passion fruit and citrus are more tropical and inviting than you're average Macabeo. The palate is lush and fresh, with sweet green fruit flavors and then a wash of cutting acidity. Simple and fruity bargain white wine.",Old Vines,87,10,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Macabeo,Yasa
53864,Spain,"The bouquet is fresh and offers clean red fruit aromas and not too much candy. The palate is lifted and healthy, with fresh red apple, plum and red licorice flavors.

53876,Spain,"Pineapple and citrus cover the fruity side of the bouquet while oak and resin aromas confirm that it's a barrel-fermented wine. The palate has a good mouthfeel and solid acidity, but the flavors of apple and citrus are woody and resiny. A small-production wine that requires an affinity for woodiness to fully appreciate.",En Barrica,87,24,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Protos
53907,Spain,"Talk about a wine that makes you take notice. This is simply great modern Rioja. The nose is creamy but honest, with black fruit, mocha and finely tanned leather. The palate gives the whole range of berry and tree fruits, with expansive tannins and just enough core acidity to make it stunning. Ultra stylish and delicious; another huge success for the Eguren family that owns San Vicente and other Rioja properties.",NA,97,65,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,San Vicente
53970,Spain,"A slightly murky and chemical-smelling wine with a nose of rubber band, beets, red fruits and licorice. It's sweet and roasted in the mouth, with molasses and raisin flavors. Hard tannins and a gritty finish make it a tough run.

53974,Spain,"Nobody ever said Yecla in southern Spain is Sauvignon Blanc country, but here is proof that the grape does exist there.

Imported by Freixenet USA.",NA,84,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Garnacha,Tapeña
53988,Spain,"Early match-stick aromas fade and give way to scents of white fruits and wisteria flower.

53989,Spain,"Rather oily and hard on the nose, with dried cheese, brett, mint and black fruit. The palate is rich and extremely forward, and the flavors are sweet but not that substantive or complex. Chocolate and mocha on the finish are about as much carry-through as you get.",Gran Viu Selección,84,36,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Red Blend,Viñedos y Bodegas Pablo
53998,Spain,"Rather baked and heavy, with chunky black fruit and chocolate on the nose. First in line on the palate is raisin and prune, while in back of that there's vanilla, dill and brown sugar. With grating tannins and excess weight, this one has balance issues while still offering some good looks at Ribera del Duero. Imported by Admiral Imports.",Reserva,84,29,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Finca El Encinal
54108,Spain,"This Catalonian blend is a concentrated number with a narrow, fruit-forward nose and cheesy leather on the side. The palate is full, grabby and ripe; flavors of blackberry and cassis are jammy and dark. It finishes sweet in flavor and ultraripe in feel, with a syrupy aftertaste. Another year or two in bottle will help this settle down; drink through 2020.",Terrer d'Aubert,90,40,Catalonia,Tarragona,NA,Red Blend,Vinyes del Terrer
54156,Spain,"Pulpy and also minerally on the nose, with basic white fruit aromas. Zesty, crisp and defined by slate and lime in the mouth, with apple, lime and dryness to the flavor profile. A composed little white wine for simple sipping or white sangria.",NA,87,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Viura,El Coto
54157,Spain,"Slightly darker than most basic Campo de Borja Tempranillos, with earthy aromas along with black fruit notes.

A good wine with guts.",NA,87,13,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Tempranillo,El Pensador
54160,Spain,"Apple, sweetness, gardenia and yeast make for a correct and pleasant bouquet. The palate is smooth and full, with crisp green apple and orange flavors leading to a citrusy, lively finish. Good and well made for a standard Cava.",Aliguer Brut Vintage,87,14,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Agustí Torelló

54179,Spain,"Crisp and neutral in style, from nose to tail. The bouquet is firm and condensed, with nothing too floral or blowsy to latch onto.

54183,Spain,"Our wine of the year in 2007 (the '04 El Puntido) is back with a vengeance in the 2005 vintage. This is a deep-fruited modern specimen with that elusive mix of floral, fruit and meaty characteristics. The palate is ripe and everlasting, with berry, coffee and hickory flavors. Long and calm on the finish, with amazing texture. An excellent encore to the prior year's achievement.",El Puntido,95,65,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Viñedos de Paganos
54196,Spain,"With the exact same rating as the awesome 2004, this new vintage of Aurus is an unbridled winner. It's a little creamy and sweet on first blush, but time and air reveals its darker, more serious side. Flavors of blackberry, barbecued beef and fudge tell all you need to know about ripeness and richness, and among the new classics of Rioja, Aurus is one of the leaders. Drink now and over the next three years. It's not really for long-term cellaring.",Aurus,94,248,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Finca Allende

54307,Spain,"Smells a little fiery, although you do get decent cherry and raspberry from the nose. Solid enough in the mouth, with ripe plum and black cherry flavors in front of a candied, vanilla-ladened finish. Pretty good, with commercially viable sweetness.",NA,84,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Tapeña
54308,Spain,"A hint of burnt leaves and compost draws down the bouquet, but overall this is a decent $9 wine. It's crisp, acidic and a little stemmy, but amid the leanness it also has an appealing fresh quality that emphasizes red fruit, pepper and snap.",NA,84,9,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Sardasol
54316,Spain,"Given the price, this wine is more than acceptable and may even be pleasing for those not seeking greatness. It is punchy and grapey, with a bit of dried cheese on the nose along with berry and plum. It's sizable, loud, concentrated and tastes pretty good. Among $7 wines, it's recommended.",Ilagares Tinto,84,7,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas San Martín
54317,Spain,"Aromas of berry fruits, coconut and leather add up well, but the wine falls off in the mouth, where it's sweet, gummy and jacked up.

54324,Spain,"Char-accented wild berry and plum aromas go straight into a bright, edgy palate of cherry and plum, and overall this is a simple, slightly candied Garnacha that has some sizzle and burn to it. Racy and the slightest bit green at its core.",Real de Aragon,84,11,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Garnacha,Pagos Familia Langa
54329,Spain,"A heavy aromatic dose of funk, bramble and rubber is what greets you, and that reduced awkwardness never leaves the wine. Size and in-your-face leather and animal notes are dominant traits, and only below that do you find blackberry, plum and any mellowness. A good mouthfeel is the wine's saving grace. Imported by Frontier Wine Imports.",Azul,83,18,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Estancia Piedra
54457,Spain,"Dark and medicinal smelling, with brandied blackberry and hard cheese aromas.

54479,Spain,"White fruits, flower blossom and a touch of brine work the nose, which is followed by flush, semisweet apple, gooseberry and lime flavors.

54488,Spain,"Here's a serious Cava with Champagne qualities. The nose is nutty and rich, with hints of vanilla and popcorn that aren't overdone. The palate is toasty but also candied, with citrus blending perfectly with butterscotch. Plump and ripe through the finish, this is high-end and stylish, as Spanish bubbly goes.

54579,Spain,"Best early and then it shows its lesser pedigree later on. Early aromas of ripe berry fruit aren't bad before they shift to measurably jumpy and edgy. There's black cherry candy flavors and then snap, crackle and pop on the tongue. Good for the price.",Opera Prima,83,6,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,J. Garcia Carrion
54580,Spain,"Seems sort of waxy and baked, with mildly acrid aromas of burnt corn leading the way. The palate has an o.k. feel but the flavors are rather bitter and burnt, and the fruit isn't pointed or expressive. May already be past its prime.

54586,Spain,"Not bad on the nose, where strawberry and cream aromas are doused a bit by a burnt-field smell.

54589,Spain,"Pleasant but very basic, with a nose of dry cherry and a palate that's crisp, lean and features flavors of tart plum and cherry.

Imported by Classic Wines, Inc.",Añares Crianza,83,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Olarra
54590,Spain,"Starts out on shaky ground with coconut and chemical aromas. In the mouth, it hits very hard with cola, raisin and cherry flavors. Falls flat and empty on the finish, and as a whole it seems overdone. Seems like a novelty, and at $36 it fails to impress.",NA,83,36,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Petite Verdot,Casa de la Ermita
54592,Spain,"Roll out the barrel, or the staves, or the oak dust, or whatever it is that gives this modest Chardonnay such an overpowering wood element.

54599,Spain,"With tobacco, licorice, herbs, bell pepper and carob, there's a bit of everything to this Navarran Cabernet. The palate is thick and chewy, but it's also sticky and very tannic. Flavors run toward vegetal and green, with clove, burnt sugar and roasted fruit. Heat and molasses work the finish of this beefy beast that lacks clarity.",Palacio de Otazu Altar,83,54,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Cabernet Blend,Otazu
54720,Spain,"Fresh apple and lime aromas are pure as can be. This is chiseled, crisp and crystalline in the mouth, with lime, grapefruit and other citrus flavors. A long, firm, flavorful finish brings a slight hint of citrus  pith the longer it runs out.",NA,90,16,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Montespina
54725,Spain,"This has a charred, roasted opening along with big black-fruit aromas. Saturated and full-bodied, it offers flavors of baked berry, plum and herbs. It's long, expectedly toasty and fully oaked on the finish, with chunky, rubbery tannins. Drink through 2016.",Venta la Ossa,90,21,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Syrah,Mano A Mano
54726,Spain,"Ripe, jammy, berry flavors are fruity, with a roasted overtone. This feels round, rubbery and fresh, while broad berry flavors include hints of herbs but not much in the way of minerality or nuance. An extracted, slightly tannic finish is weighty and smooth, but ordinary.",Salmos,90,40,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Torres
54750,Spain,"A bit neutral for Verdejo, yet the wine's clean orange, tangerine and lime flavors are appealing. Flashes across the palate quickly, leaving light but lasting citrusy flavors on the finish. Solid, standard and ready to drink.",NA,87,15,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Marqués de Irún
54753,Spain,"Strawberry and raspberry aromas are muddled by a burnt stalky character. In the mouth, it has good weight and flavors of fresh herbs, mint and slightly burnt, sulfuric cherry and raspberry. Shows a candied raspberry finish along with notes of herbs.",Brut Rosado,86,15,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Castillo de Perelada
54757,Spain,"Maybe it's already late in this wine's lifespan but the nose has a corny, overly mature set of aromas that fail to convey freshness. The mouth is more zesty and citrusy, with round flavors of orange, tangerine and dry melon. A basic wine without a lot of complexity or finish.",Rebisaca,86,25,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,White Blend,Do Ferreiro
54771,Spain,"Crusty, sweet, medicinal aromas open the game. The palate has a creamy sweetness to it along with black cherry and plum flavors. Tastes more candied and oaky as it unfolds, but overall it's more than decent and very modern.",La Vendimia,86,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Palacios Remondo
54773,Spain,"Racy cherry and red plum aromas are a bit fiery and jumpy, while the palate is forward and juicy, with sweet berry fruit flavors that carry a bit of vanilla from three months of oak aging. Fades fast on the finish, leaving a touch of caramel flavor.",Old Vine,86,12,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Tempranillo,Monastir
54776,Spain,"Nice, simple and still showing staying power for an '09. Tastes of white stone fruits and melon, and shows body and adequate acidity. Not the most citric or angular Verdejo; it's more round and easy. Finishes clean with no funk. Uncomplicated white wine for immediate consumption.",NA,86,13,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Ermita de Nieve
54789,Spain,"Ripe and modern, with a bold color and no shortage of oak. But with clean black fruit, integration and great structure, the wine handles all the wood thrown at it.

Ripe and complete, and drinkable now through 2010 at least.",Cuvée Especial,92,29,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Sierra Cantabria
54790,Spain,"Opaque in color, with reduced aromas of mushroom, rubber and so forth. But do not give up on this masculine bruiser; it will loosen up with air and offer plum, leather and chocolate flavors that are nothing short of excellent. And while it's a touch zesty at its core, the wine still mixes in enough coffee and richness to make it a modern-style success story.",Norte,92,92,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Pujanza
54902,Spain,"A mixture of tomato, jammy red fruit, alcohol and grit gives this four-grape, Garnacha-led blend a tough path to hoe. In the mouth, the fruit is shrill as it settles on raspberry and cherry, while the feel and length are short. Hits the palate then it's gone in a flash.",Garnacha & smc,83,17,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Red Blend,Viladellops

54904,Spain,"Standard berry along with warm, earthy aromas give it some size, and the palate shows medium-bodied raspberry and strawberry flavors.

54907,Spain,"Rhubarb and brambly black cherry aromas set up sweet, candied, fairly forced red-berry flavors that have a green element and a slightly cloying feel.

54910,Spain,"Neutral smelling, with a hint of pool water to the nose. The palate delivers a strange combination of mustard and white grapefruit, and the finish is pithy to the extreme and mildly bitter. The blend is the uncommon mix of Sauvignon Blanc and Macabeo (Viura).

54911,Spain,"Aromas of strawberry, cassis and mocha are brought down a notch by vegetal notes, while the palate is heavier than the winery's straight-ahead Tempranillo.

54918,Spain,"Same score as the prior vintage, and pretty much the same tart wine. It's red in color, sweet and candied on the nose, and awkward in general.

Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Monte Castrillo Rosado,82,14,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Finca Torremilanos
54923,Spain,"Seems like the hot sun of central Spain got to this three-grape blend because it's undeniably sweet and baked. The aromas are pure raisin, while the palate is drawn down and syrupy. Too thick and sweet for its own good.",Crianza,82,18,Central Spain,Manchuela,NA,Red Blend,Vega Tolosa

54994,Spain,"This barrel-aged Viura shows the upside of what is normally a pretty ordinary grape variety. Melon, apple, hay and minerally aromas are lively and don't seem nearly five years along.

Drink now.",Plácet,90,45,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Viura,Palacios Remondo
54995,Spain,"Despite heavy aromas of baked berry, prune and raisin, this is solid on the palate, with a firm grip.

Drink through 2018.",Reserva,90,45,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Contino
54996,Spain,"Initially, this comes across as being baked out and tired, but give it time to spread out and it reveals mature, earthy, leafy aromas and a round palate with choppy, firm tannins.

55010,Spain,"As is normal for Embruix, the nose is generous and jammy, with extracted flavors of grapy black fruits and earth.

55054,Spain,"Leafy and smoky on the nose, with a firm, crusty topping. The palate is driving but has sheering acidity, while the palate shows blazing cherry, plum and tomato flavors.

55055,Spain,"A lot of toasty oak on the nose announces this wine's barrel-fermented roots, and additional lemon and apple aromas are classy. In the mouth, however, it runs narrow, with sugary, almost late-harvest flavors of honey, mango and pineapple. A different style of Godello that's sweet and soft. Drink now.",NA,86,30,Northern Spain,Valdeorras,NA,Godello,Avanthia
55074,Spain,"Smells baked and a little sweet, and also a touch raisiny.

55098,Spain,"A leader in user-friendly Monastrell from Jumilla is Luzón.

55102,Spain,"Dark, ripe and handsome. Those are the basics on this showy wine. Aromas of leather, shoe polish and char darken up the berry fruit, while flavors of blackberry and plum vie with oak-based mocha.

55103,Spain,"Light in color with aromas of finely scented bath soap, strawberry, fresh cream and steel.

Still, it's an elegant wine with punch bowl flavors.",Rosé Brut Reserva,91,20,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Llopart

55216,Spain,"Thin and saline on the nose, with a chemical-chlorine smell. The palate is fairly sour and raw, with tough tannins and a killer grip.

55300,Spain,"Black-fruit aromas are lively and encouraging. The mouthfeel is a touch clamped and narrow, but airing and aging should help things expand.

55313,Spain,"This tiny production (250 cases), single-vineyard wine is boisterous on the nose, with pushy aromas of violet petal, earthy berry, cleaning solution and citrusy oak. Pronounced acidity and a raw, resiny oak texture give a hard, choppy feel, while flavors of cheese, coconut, vanilla and raspberry announce a warm-vintage wine. On the finish, excess acidity and abrasive tannins call for additional cellaring; best from 2015 onward.",Finca La Blanquera,90,85,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Monteabellón

55358,Spain,"Generic smelling, with simple melon and citrus aromas. The palate has the right level of tang and acidity, which uplifts apple, nectarine and gooseberry flavors. Tight on the finish, with lock-down acids. Very zesty stuff; a mix of Sauvignon Blanc and Verdejo.",Bl8 Birlocho,86,10,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo-Sauvignon Blanc,Prado Rey
55359,Spain,"Blackberry, rubber, dark fruit and a lactic note define the bouquet, which leads to a sizable, full-bodied palate with tea, herb and dark fruit flavors.

55377,Spain,"Pointed and fresh on the nose despite a whopping and seemingly heavy 15.5% alcohol level.

55501,Spain,"Reasonably fresh on the nose, but ultranarrow and tart in the mouth. In fact, it's borderline sour in the way it presents such linear red fruit. Tight as a drum and sheering.

55658,Spain,"The price is too elevated given that the wine is simple and already fading. Aromas of peach and melon are soft and a touch mealy, and so is the palate, which has a flat feel and flavors of papaya, melon and apple.

55680,Spain,"The price on this high-flying Rioja continues to go through the roof, and so does the oak and tannin. And while we still appreciate the wine's intensity and power, this vintage pushes so much espresso, burnt nut and rubber that it probably won't impress all comers.

55684,Spain,"Questionable value at $70, but this is very good and rather unique white Rioja. Remelluri uses a multitude of common and unheard-of grapes, and they hit it with a lot of oak.

55978,Spain,"Fresh and healthy for Toro Malvasia, with soft apple and sweet lime flavors. The feel and approach are good, and the wine is acidic but not too much, which helps preserve the mouthfeel. Finishes nice and standard.",NA,85,11,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Malvasia,Cermeño
55988,Spain,"Quite light to look at and seemingly like chewing gum upon first sniff. But give it time and inspection and you'll get melon, lime and crystal-clear acids and body. There's no fat to this Cava nor any heavy toast or cream. It's lean and wiry, and the fruit is front and center.",Brut Nature,89,28,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Llopart
55990,Spain,"Melon and buttercup aromas are clean, inviting and exactly what you should expect from Albariño. The palate is also a success, with apple, pineapple and citrus flavors. A complete, fresh-style wine with the right mix of acidity and body. Drink now and until the next vintage arrives.",NA,89,17,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Nora
56004,Spain,"Deep in color for an '01, with sweet aromas of vanilla, tobacco, leather and hickory. The palate is endowed with big berry fruit and flavors directed by wood spice, and the tannic level is just right given the wine's midterm age. With licorice, resin and additional hickory on the finish, 7 Viñas (vineyards) is one of Baron de Ley's better efforts.",7 Viñas Reserva,89,69,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Baron De Ley
56005,Spain,"Opens with chocolate chip and mint aromas along with solid berry fruit. The palate is pure and firm, offering clean cherry and plum flavors backed by light new oak and chocolate. More like a comfortable pair of jeans than a fine suit, but there are plenty of occasions where that's what you want. Imported by America Uncorked.",Crianza,89,23,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Luis Alegre
56007,Spain,"A touch minty and herbal, but also there's chocolate and creamy richness to the nose. This is a big wine that's hugely flavorful. It rumbles from bold berry to smoky dryness, and along the way there are stops at chocolate, coffee and black pepper. Always one of Jumilla's better wines, assuming you like the extracted, modern style.",NA,89,16,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Juan Gil
56132,Spain,"Mango, citrus and candied white-fruit aromas set up a weighty yet vital palate with melon, apple, citrus and gooseberry flavors. On the finish, mellow flavors of stone fruits and mild acidity create a pure, solid ending. Drink immediately.",NA,89,19,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Abadía de Tortoreos
56133,Spain,"White fruits, fennel and Serrano ham aromas create a sophisticated bouquet. This jabs away on the palate courtesy of citric acidity, while flavors of nectarine and citrus are good. It finishes dry and foamy.",Opus Evolutium Privat Gran Reserva Brut Nature,89,46,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Alta Alella
56148,Spain,"Dusty, yeasty citrus aromas are elegant, smoky and dry. In the mouth, it is well developed and a touch short, but with crispness and focus. Flavors of peach and mild citrus are slightly briny.",de Nit,89,NA,Spain Other,Spain,NA,Sparkling Blend,Raventós I Blanc
56151,Spain,"Aromas of graphite, asphalt, floral berry, black cherry and oak are harmonious and inviting. This wine feels juicy and rubbery, while black-fruit and plum flavors come with herbal notes and overt barrel notes. A fresh, juicy, zesty finish is pure Graciano.",Vendimia Seleccionada,89,19,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Graciano,Viña Herminia
56198,Spain,"A little charred and oaky at first, but also meaty, leathery and true to Rioja and Tempranillo. The palate is flush and full, with expansive tannins and acidity propping up olive and herb-tinged blackberry flavors. Medium deep and long on the finish. A positive, semimodern Rioja that can handle some aging.",NA,89,39,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Pujanza
56199,Spain,"An Albariño with some body and complexity, Nora's single-vineyard, barrel-aged wine is definitely an oaky one. It has lots of wood dust, vanilla and lemon curd on the nose. The flavor profile is led by apples and cinnamon (from the oak), and it flows well. Not a sticky, overoaked load; instead it has balance and quasi-Burgundian feel.",NA,89,28,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Nora da Neve
56205,Spain,"Nice on the nose, with mildly herbal red-fruit, leather, tobacco and tomato-leaf aromas. The palate is full in size, with both creaminess and clamping tannins. The palate delivers earthy raspberry and plum flavors, while vanilla and pepper share the finish. Very nice and still capable of withstanding more cellar time. Drink now through 2013.",Viña Santurnia Gran Reserva,89,36,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,R. de Ayala Lete E Hijos
56207,Spain,"An opening salvo of honey and white fruits is solid as can be. The palate rolls out dry, angular citrus, pineapple and apple flavors in front of a finish that's naturally fresh and nutty. A bubbly with no muss, fuss or confusion. Best if you like ‘em dry.",Capdevila Pujol Reserva Especial Brut Natural,89,15,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Cava Blancher
56209,Spain,"Light yellow in color and slightly woody on the nose. This blend isn't overly oaked but it is plump, rich and textured. The palate features melon, lychee and spice flavors, while the back end is full and dry, with an ending blast of green melon. Drink now.",Blanco,89,35,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Finca Allende
56210,Spain,"Serious and huge, but talk about a ton of oak: this has a ton and a half, yielding sawdust-based aromas along with creamy plum notes. The thing is, once you realize that you're all-in with the wood, it tastes good, feels good and finishes good. A 3M wine: mint, molasses and medicine. But in this style it's done well.",Atteca Armas Old Vines,89,45,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Garnacha,Bodegas Ateca
56218,Spain,"Clean, inviting and lively, with pure berry character spread across the nose and palate. For flavors, we're talking plum, berry and chocolate, while the finish is creamy and toasty, with good balance. Not an over-the-top wine or a full-out thriller, but very good from a region known for pricey red blends.",NA,89,125,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Dits del Terra
56252,Spain,"The first couple of passes are not that encouraging: there's strawberry Kool-Aid and sharp field-like aromas of thistle and bramble. But the palate is not bad at all; it is flush yet racy, with solid raspberry and plum flavors that carry onto the finish. Not a refined wine but a natural one.",Faristol,84,14,Catalonia,Terra Alta,NA,Garnacha,Covilalba
56254,Spain,"A bit cheesy and funky, with rhubarb and leather along with baked berry aromas. The palate feels fine, but the flavors are leathery and sort of salty, with touches of pepper and herbs as well. Not as ripe and appealing as what we're looking for from a Rioja reserva.",Reserva,84,24,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Baron De Ley
56266,Spain,"Solid but unspectacular on the nose, with plum scents and generic sweetness. The palate is also sweet, but it has enough acidity and tannin to create a serious, almost scratchy mouthfeel. And if you hadn't had enough sweetness up to this point, the finish is loaded with brown sugar, cola and cough medicine.",Vega Ibor,84,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Real
56267,Spain,"By no means a special wine but it does deliver full-force if generic dark-fruit aromas and flavors. The nose is a little hard and rubbery, but that's Utiel-Requena for you. Medium-bodied but not harsh or burnt; prune and blackberry flavors linger. Tempranillo and Syrah. Wines Imported by USA Wines Inc.",Las Dosces,84,13,Levante,Utiel-Requena,NA,Red Blend,Chozas Carrascal
56272,Spain,"Bramble and burning brush on the nose, while the palate is murky as it delivers tomato leaf, baked plum and carob flavors. Seems sort of cooked and funky, with a muddled mouthfeel. The 2005 is a cleaner, more focused wine.",NA,83,10,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Coto de Hayas
56274,Spain,"Dill, cheese and mossy fruit give this wine a less than super bouquet. The palate is light, with strawberry flavors mixed with some peppery, herbal overtones. Short on the finish; not much bang for the buck.",Reserva,83,19,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Diez-Caballero
56278,Spain,"Cloudy in appearance but fairly clear on the nose and palate. Rhubarb and cherry aromas give this an austere, red-fruit bouquet, and the palate rests on racy cherry and doesn't budge. Lean late in the game, with coffee and bitterness to the thin, mildly grating finish.",Vertus,83,13,Levante,Utiel-Requena,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Iranzo
56279,Spain,"Lean, dry raspberry aromas and a slight floral essence carry the nose toward a zesty, semisharp palate with crisp cherry and cranberry flavors. Not bad in a lean, stripped-back way; but there's no excess oak, weight or sweetness. Lean stuff for old-school palates nursing plates of ham or salami.",Arderius,83,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Leza García
56281,Spain,"The under-$10 high scorer is fast disappearing, so take a good look at this young, jammy Tempranillo-Shiraz blend that hits nicely with ripe boysenberry and black plum. The Shiraz seems to have darkened the wine, and the mouthfeel is ripe and lush.",Tempranillo + Shiraz,88,8,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Volteo
56288,Spain,"Cabernet Sauvignon and Monastrell made in a ripe, high-alcohol style results in monster aromas of shoe polish and black licorice. The palate is a wave of chocolate and candied black fruits that crashes into a heavy, ultraripe finish of prune and pepper. A lunker wine with a sweet smile and a big handshake.",NA,88,130,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Cabernet Blend,El Nido
56290,Spain,"This wine's nose bears an uncanny similarity to animal crackers, and along the way there's peach and melon aromas. The palate is sweet and slightly punchy, with mango and white raisin flavors. Overall, bank on sweetness and liquidy ripeness from this drink-now Albariño.",NA,88,23,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Fulget
56294,Spain,"Spicy wood notes and black fruit vie for center stage on the ripe, semimature bouquet. This is more of a traditional Ribera wine, meaning it has textured tannins, notes of tobacco and dill, and leathery, earthy berry fruit flavors. Not at all rough and ready to drink now, but still it should hold into 2009.",Reserva,88,25,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Condado de Oriza
56300,Spain,"Clean and focused up front, with appealing cola, cherry and plum aromas. If you like wild berry flavors and juicy, borderline aggressive acidity, then Deyo fits your request. It's a fairly rough, spunky wine with finishing notes of espresso and bitter chocolate. Should match well with salty, robust foods.",Deyo,87,15,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Merlot,Castillo de Monjardin
56303,Spain,"Mature and a little waxy on the nose; this is a plump, fruity, semisoft wine with apple, pineapple and melon flavors. It's round and fairly mild, with plenty of taste, width and drinkability. Drink soon before it softens even further.",El Bino,87,13,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,El Bully
56305,Spain,"Ripe grapefruit aromas take care of the nose, while the palate shows smooth-edged citrus and grapefruit flavors. For a warm-vintage wine, this one is holding in pretty well; it has a plump body but enough liveliness to do what it should with food. Drink now; it's not getting any better.",NA,87,18,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Aura
56431,Spain,"Lime, tarragon and fresh green aromas are a bit minerally and stony in front of a linear, pure palate. Flavors of lemon-lime, peach and nectarine are just right, moderately minerally and fade away with clarity and style. Drink right away.",NA,89,14,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Valdelainos
56443,Spain,"Black cherry and wild berry aromas are appealing and lusty. In the mouth, this blend of Sryah, Graciano, Tempranillo and Petit Verdot is solid but a bit thin in the middle. Flavors of raw oak, coffee and cherry finish with a wave of creamy oak. Despite its modest structure, this is a very good and interesting blend to drink now.",Maza Cruz,89,22,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Red Blend,Dehesa de los Llanos
56444,Spain,"Brandied cherry and cassis aromas are candied and gritty, but get better with airing. The wine is full in body and endowed with just enough acidity. Flavors of baked berry are earthy at the core, with accents of chocolate and herbs. A mellow, not overpowering finish is dry and slightly complex. Drink through 2017.",Reserva,89,30,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Dinastía Vivanco
56458,Spain,"Given that this leesy Albariño is pushing eight years in age, it's remarkably healthy. Stony, briny aromas override residual fruit aromas, while the palate remains zesty. Flavors of white grapefruit and nectarine finish citric and solid.  This is a unique style of wine that no other winery in Rías Baixas is making.",Selección de Añada,89,75,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Pazo de Señorans
56493,Spain,"Ripe and fully oaked, with char, mineral, cola and black-fruit aromas. In the high-flying world that is premium Priorato, this wine is serious and tough. It displays berry, plum and herbal flavors and then a thick, broad, tannic finish. Shows a tiny bit of green at its heart. 750 cases produced.",Primitiu de Bellmont,88,50,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Celler Bartolomé
56494,Spain,"The warm 2003 vintage provided this Merlot-Tempranillo blend with additional ripeness and color. And while there's still the traditional tobacco, dried cherry and herb/spice aromas the region is known for, there's also good raspberry, red plum and vanilla flavors. A well-made wine that's ready to drink now.",Reserva,88,22,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo-Merlot,Earth 2.0
56495,Spain,"Cristalino is always a solid go-to Cava. This brut is round, slightly yeasty and shows citrus aromas that veer toward lemon-lime. The palate is healthy and clean, with a narrow set of citrus and apple flavors. Fairly full and long on the finish, which makes the whole package more than worthwhile given the cost.",Brut,88,9,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Cristalino
56503,Spain,"A dry and austere style is what you're looking at with Heredad. The nose offers simple citrus and soda aromas, while the palate is sheer and defined by apple, light spice and cleansing acidity. Not much depth below the surface but definitely clean and flashy.",Reserva Heredad,88,20,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
56510,Spain,"Dibon is new to us, and after tasting this complete, well-made Cava we are happy to make its acquaintance. The nose offers regal yeast and richness, while the palate has complexity to prop up apple, citrus and grapefruit flavors. Solid from front to back, with health and freshness.",Brut Reserve,88,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Dibon
56514,Spain,"Jammy, rich and a little sweet and reduced on the nose, but once this baby unwinds there's no stopping it. The palate is exceedingly fresh and exuberant, with strawberry and raspberry flavors. Lively to the end; a fruit-lover's wine with no leash. Drink sooner than later to capture the wine's pointed red-fruit essence.",Atteca Old Vines,88,16,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Garnacha,Bodegas Ateca
56516,Spain,"Very nice red wine but for $112 we want to be forced to take notice, and frankly that doesn't really happen here. Still, the wine goes snap, crackle and pop on both the bouquet and palate. It's a crisp one, with live-wire cherry, cola and spice flavors. Not at all flabby, and instead runs lean and fresh. Good now and maybe better in a few more years.",NA,88,112,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,L'Arbossar
56524,Spain,"Light but generic aromas of white fruits and white flowers give this wine a happy bouquet. The palate is starting to tip toward fading, but if you get at it soon you'll find perfectly nice peach, melon and citrus flavors setting up a soft, easygoing finish.",Terra d'Ouro,87,20,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Pazo De Villarei
56533,Spain,"Just a bit mulchy on the nose, which signals that is a wine from the hot 2003 vintage. The palate sits on raisin and mocha, and there's even a creamy, thick feel to it. If you like rich, Porty flavors that border on dessert, it's likable. But be prepared for it to hit with a thud.",Reserva,87,49,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Alidis
56537,Spain,"Inky dark, with deep berry, sandalwood and sawmill aromas. Color and potency are not lacking in this modern-styled Tempranillo, which hits like a hammer. Feelwise, this is a tough, angular wine that will benefit from another year or two of aging. Now it's very tight and tannic, with piercing acidity.",MC,87,46,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marqués de Cáceres
56545,Spain,"Castilla y León can be good bargain country, and all of the 2006 Volteo wines are Best Buy qualifiers. This varietal Tempranillo has a clean, fruity nose backed by bright berry flavors built on a floor or two of structure. It's a composed quaffer with pure flavors, adequate length and overall balance.",NA,87,8,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Volteo
56550,Spain,"The only sweetness on offer is on the nose. After that, things go lightweight and tangy, leaving a racy feel and semiastringent cherry flavors. A real sizzler with zesty red fruit and not much else.",Montesierra Oak Aged,83,9,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Pirineos
56556,Spain,"Simple, candied cava is what this is. The nose deals red licorice and cherry, while the palate is bubbly and plump, with plum and raspberry flavors. Not much detail but plenty of size and carbonation.",Rosat-Sec,83,15,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Família Oliveda
56557,Spain,"Meaty and very oaky, with resin, mocha and milky aromas that amount to a wood cutter's dream. Not surprisingly, the mouthfeel is more shocking and acidic than the oaky bouquet suggests; flavors are racy and tart, and then a bitter lactic quality comes on strong. Too much going on, with nothing pulling in the same direction.",Crianza,83,15,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,Gladium
56564,Spain,"Blocky and brambly on the nose, with a fair amount of funk. The palate is crisp, semitart and lean-bodied, and with tight acidity it's a little scouring. Lots of red-fruit character but not a lot of mouthfeel.",Single Estate Garnacha - Merlot,83,11,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Red Blend,Reula
56566,Spain,"Pickle and sweet funk on the nose give this chunky wine a nose that's less than fresh. Flavors of orange, peach and cantaloupe are sweet but flat, and in the end it tastes more like a fruit juice than a really solid dry rosé.",Rosado,83,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Darien
56574,Spain,"Quite an unusual specimen in that you don't often see Monastrell mixed with Cabernet and Shiraz. The end result is fairly strange and unfamiliar; the nose smells saucy and lean, while the palate is also saucy and a touch medicinal.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz-Monastrell,83,11,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Mad Dogs & Englishmen
56575,Spain,"Rusty in color but natural, which is also this wine's downfall. It has no dosage, so what's left is leafy, herbal Pinot Noir aromas and flavors. It's peachy, drying and zesty, but also saddled with tomato leaf and rhubarb. Such is the life of Brut Nature rosé.",Brut Nature,83,40,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Pinot Noir,Maria Casanovas
56579,Spain,"The name boasts of balance but we find mostly pine needle, skunk and eventually creamy red-fruit aromas followed by lean, tangy stawberry and cherry flavors. Light fruit and simple oak is all that's here.",A4 Nuestro Equilibrio,83,23,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Anta
56747,Spain,"Aromas of cured meat, earthy plum and dry berry fruits are composed and harmonious. This mature wine feels firm and a touch grating, while ripe flavors of blackberry and plum are borderline baked. On the finish, a chocolaty flavor and modest depth are solid but don't amplify the wine. Drink now.",NA,89,25,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,Yemaserena
56753,Spain,"Rubbery, rooty aromas of herbs and berries blend with stalky red-fruit notes. This feels shrill and tangy, with hard tannins, while flavors of roasted berry fruits come with a leafy undercurrent. Roasted, herbal, oaky flavors settle in on a juicy, high-acid finish. Drink through 2020.",F,89,85,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Fuentespina
56791,Spain,"A lively number with kick and effervescence. The nose is kind, with light fruits and a whiff of chocolate. Plum and raspberry flavors are nice and accented by earthy spice, while the wine's texture and structure seem more than solid, given its everyday price.",Brut Rosé,88,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
56792,Spain,"Fairly stylish and quite serious. There's darkness to the nose along with masculine, meaty, leathery aromas. And while the bouquet is sturdy and begs you to dig in, the palate is a little less generous as it shows some herbal sharpness at its core. Overall there's commendable cherry and plum flavors, but the wine lacks some depth.",Finca Monasterio,88,47,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Baron De Ley
56805,Spain,"Alberdi from La Rioja Alta is a slight throwback. The nose has more than a twinge of tomato leaf, wet clay, tobacco and raisin, but also maturity and floral notes akin to a good Burgundy. Meanwhile, the palate pitches tomato leaf, cranberry, tobacco and dried plum flavors. A little bit light and reedy by modern standards, but alluring as well. Drink now. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",Viña Alberdi Selección Especial,88,27,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,La Rioja Alta
56815,Spain,"A little wheaty and creamy, but also pleasantly warm, yeasty and toasty. The palate settles quickly on waxy apple and lemon, while the feel is sort of baked and a touch soft. Cider and sweet-spice notes help the finish along. Drink soon.",Brut Nature Vintage,88,12,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Cristalino
56852,Spain,"Almost volatile, but with reduced raisin below. If you are familiar with   hot-climate California Zinfandel, this is not unlike that. It has a vinegary attack and then a strange but limited sweetness lurking in the weeds. A   challenged wine.",Javier Asensio Tinto,83,10,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Red Blend,Asensio
56857,Spain,"Very dark and seemingly on the cooked side of the ledger. The nose is black and raisiny, while the core flavors are saucy. At least this meaty, overdone Garnacha isn't oaked, so in that sense it isn't offensive. But it is definitely soft, and without much future.",Viñas Viejas,83,11,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Garnacha,Bodegas Agustín Cubero
56859,Spain,"Airén is a big-crop white grape that is usually distilled into brandy or made into Sherry. But here we see it as a dry white table wine, and while it is limited in scope, the wine's punch-bowl approach and cleansing lime and kiwi flavors are decent.",NA,83,8,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Airen,Sierra Virgen
56862,Spain,"Apple and powdery citrus aromas are austere but intriguing. But in the mouth, this thing foams like bubble bath. No matter whether you like the wine's citric flavors and apple essence or not, the fact that it bubbles up like a shaken soda is not an attribute. Oriel's gran reserva is similar in terms of carbonation issues.",Brut,82,18,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Oriol Rossell
56868,Spain,"Brambly and tart, with a peppery, leathery nose. It's zesty, lightly concentrated Garnacha with zingy, mouth-burning raspberry and plum flavors. A sharp, reticent wine in every way. Imported by USA Wine Imports.",Ladera,82,21,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Garnacha,Algairen
56869,Spain,"A lesson in contrasts: the nose is both weedy and sweet, with green strawberry aromas mixing with caramel. The palate is also green and slightly bitter, but that's offset by some jammy berry sweetness. Medium in terms of weight, but with burdensome sugars and a clumsy finish.",Vertus Crianza,82,15,Levante,Utiel-Requena,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Iranzo
56872,Spain,"An herbal and brambly roughneck with forced aromas, lots of leather, and ultimately cranberry and other tart red-fruit flavors. Not much body, and thus it's short and piquant.",Roble,82,21,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Hemar
56888,Spain,"Nice and familiar, and very much in the sweet, creamy style. There's almond candy and caramel on the palate and then maple syrup on the finish. Soft and sweet throughout, with just enough acidity and complexity to save it from being boring.",Oloroso Dulce Cream,87,11,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Osborne
56898,Spain,"This is Cáceres' bread-and-butter red Rioja, and the '04 is fruity, light and very approachable. The nose shows some cotton candy and other bouncy red-fruit aromas, while the palate is easygoing, fleshy and balanced by a beam of juicy acidity. Along the way, you'll pull out flavors of cherry, raspberry and a finishing note of bitter coffee.",Crianza,87,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marqués de Cáceres
56899,Spain,"Superripe, such that it's medicinal and pruny. The nose reeks of reduced blueberry and cassis, while the palate is soft, low in acidity and full of ripe, dark raisin, prune and spice cake flavors. If you like a dense wine, this is it. But expect it to be Port-like and on the liqueur-ish side. Drink now.",Estate Bottled,87,45,Central Spain,Dominio de Valdepusa,NA,Petit Verdot,Marques de Griñon
56902,Spain,"A maturing wine with aromas of burnt leaves, dill, leather and shaded black fruit. It opens up on the palate, revealing cherry, raspberry and plum flavors along with ancillary vanilla. With medium tannins and moderate acidity, the wine shows no ill effects of the broiling 2003 vintage. Drink now.",Crianza,87,15,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Condado de Oriza
56904,Spain,"Cepas Vellas refers to old vines, but what's most noticeable on this wine is the popcorn and cream that characterizes both the nose and mouth. In between the oak-aided folds there's melon, waxy papaya and banana flavors sitting on a plump, cushioned palate. It's a holdover from 2005, so drink it while you have it.",Aquis Celenis Cepas Vellas,87,18,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Fernando Diéguez Otero
57092,Spain,"Clean and stylish, with hints of ginger ale and citrus on the nose. Good in terms of texture and flavors, with citrus and juicy nectarine working the palate. Focused and fairly long on the finish, with depth and integrity. Sweet in the extra dry style, but not candied or artificially sugared.",Aria Estate Extra Dry,88,12,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
57100,Spain,"Crisp as it should be, with fit aromas of apple, fresh lettuce and honey. The palate is crystal clear in its delivery of lemon, apple and green banana, while the finish is vivacious and runs the distance. Quite satisfying and fairly serious given its under-$15 provenance.",Brut Nature,88,14,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
57106,Spain,"Seems like the best wine under the Mercedes Eguren label. This Shiraz-Tempranillo blend is wholesome, ripe and rich. It starts with earth, leather and dark, herbal fruit aromas, which are backed by lip-smacking blackberry and mocha flavors. Shows agility and balance, but also brawn and guts. Drink now into 2010.",Mercedes Eguren,88,13,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Shiraz-Tempranillo,Bodegas Eguren
57111,Spain,"With aromatic touches of haystack and vanilla in addition to green apple and mineral, the nose is inviting. On the palate, it's nice and lemony, with green apple acids offering a modest scour. Cleansing and ideal with simple finger foods. Very nice for the price.",Brut Reserva,88,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
57113,Spain,"Lemon-lime, dry talc and mineral make for a clean, no-issues bouquet. This is a fruity, steely wine with pineapple, orange, green apple and lime flavors. The feel is like a kiss of the razor, while the finish is fresh and persistent.",Brut Reserva,88,14,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Sumarroca
57116,Spain,"Crisp, neutral and just a little lemony on the nose, with a small hint of sulfuric burn. The palate is genuine and firm, with nectarine and citrus flavors holding court. Clean and lightweight on the finish, with overall elegance. Shows good flow and balance while keeping things modest.",Cuvée 21 Brut,88,14,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Parxet
57117,Spain,"A little bit round given that it's a blanc de blancs, with applesauce and spice on the nose. The palate deals a white-fruit mélange that's one part tangy and one part generous. Holds steady on the finish and doesn't show any warts or faults. Nice Cava with an elevated persona.",Blanc de Blancs Brut,88,16,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Paul Cheneau
57146,Spain,"This is about as aromatically complex as Bierzo gets. It shows radical minerality, bright berry fruit, purity and passion. The palate is a fast and exciting ride highlighted by excellent acidity, kick and ripe but restrained flavors. Corullon gets better and better with each passing vintage.",Villa de Corullon,94,50,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Descendientes de J. Palacios
57155,Spain,"An obscure Catalonian wine made from indigenous grapes, this pricey oddball starts with bubblegum and candy aromas mixed with smoke and meat. The color is dark and the wine is a bit rough. But in a country, unusual way it redeems itself with zippy cherry flavors and a fresh, tight mouthfeel. Best with food.",Gaintus,87,49,Spain Other,Vino de Mesa,NA,Red Blend,Heretat Montrubí
57164,Spain,"Earth, leather and tomato are accents to the dry, lean bouquet. The wine is expectedly juicy and tight, with snappy raspberry and cherry flavors. It shows clean lines and an unbreakable personality; elegant, juicy and firm. Drink now–2009.",Faustino V Reserva,87,22,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Faustino
57179,Spain,"Dusty and still fairly fresh, but with that said this wine was certainly more in its prime six or eight months ago. Now it is slick but softening, with peach and citrus flavors doing their thing without much edge or kick.",Faustino V Rosado,86,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Faustino
57181,Spain,"Ribera is not prime rosé country, and this wine doesn't much help the cause. Cherry cough drop aromas are about all you're going to get, while the palate is jumpy and sour, with apple skin and grapefruit flavors. Too much like a sucking candy.",Monte Castrillo Rosado,82,13,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Rosé,Finca Torremilanos
57189,Spain,"Rooty on the nose, with green herb, tea and raspberry aromas. Patience and airing only brings it to the acceptable level, which means the wine's reasonably good prune and dark-fruit flavors are scuttled by a disjointed, overly acidic mouthfeel.",Fill del Temps Gran Selecció,81,25,Catalonia,Terra Alta,NA,Red Blend,Covilalba
57196,Spain,"There's something not right about the way this winery is fermenting its Cavas because both this and Oriol Rossell's regular brut are excessively foamy. As a result, this gran reserva's apple and spice aromas and flavors are rendered moot by the gaseous explosion that occurs when liquid hits palate.",Gran Reserva Brut Nature,80,27,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Oriol Rossell
57197,Spain,"This is mucky and sweet. Its best foot is not put forward via the compost-like nose, and from then on there's little more than prune, leather and a sticky mouthfeel.",NA,80,8,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Garnacha,Castillo de Monséran
57198,Spain,"Eight grapes comprise this weird, peanutty, almost dirty red blend. The nose is like a salad of bitter greens and peanut vinaigrette, and the palate shows big fruit, bigger tannins and then a finish of asparagus and green beans. Imported by USA Wines Inc.",Las Ocho,80,25,Levante,Utiel-Requena,NA,Red Blend,Chozas Carrascal
57277,Spain,"Another winner from Emilio Moro. The nose is a touch minty and very spicy, but the black fruit element is there and overall the bouquet sings of integration. Pure, enthralling and big, with monster black fruit flavors, complexity, rich oak and a long, smooth finish. Stylish yet powerful; drink from 2013 through 2020.",Malleolus de Sanchomartin,94,205,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto Fino,Emilio Moro
57363,Spain,"With minerally, clean aromas of lemon-lime and seashell, this is ready for summer sipping. A tangy, citric palate offers pure orange, tangerine and lime flavors, with mango thrown in for moderate sweetness. A citrusy, cleansing palate is exactly as it should be.",Fuente Milano,88,11,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Verdejo-Viura,Pedro Escudero
57368,Spain,"Tarry upfront aromas of berry fruits, pencil lead and shoe polish announce plenty of oak.

57371,Spain,"The nose on this no-dosage rosé is neutral except for a touch of brine and nuttiness. The palate is fresh, sharp and a touch rough. Flavors of dried red fruits are matched by briny notes and popcorn, while the finish tastes toasty and briny.",Privat Rosé Brut Nature,88,21,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Alta Alella
57373,Spain,"Off the bat, this smells of minerals, vitamins and iodine, but with airing plum and blackberry aromas arise. The wine has snappy acidity but soft edges and mild tannins. Flavors of cola, baking spices and black fruits finish wide and easy, with a dusting of pepper. Drink now.",Reserva,88,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Conde de Altava
57392,Spain,"Wet and zesty white wine from Northwest Spain? Sounds good to us. Salneval is from Condes de Albarei, and it offers perfectly proper peach, melon and pastry aromas. The palate is lithe and fresh, with orange and apple. Yes, it's straightforward and common. But it is also clean, balanced and will drink well with all sorts of finger foods, salads and seafood.",Salneval,87,10,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Condes de Albarei
57398,Spain,"A little rubbery and spunky at first, but patience reveals foresty berry fruit, mint and spice. The palate is vibrant as can be, with red-fruit flavors coming in front of a peppery backdrop. Everything from cough drop to kir to espresso shows up in this toasty, testy and tasty organic Monastrell.",Luzon Verde Organic Grapes,87,9,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Bodegas Luzón
57401,Spain,"Warm, crusty and attractive up front, with a ripe blend of plum, raspberry and pepper flavors. Seems plush and focused for such an inexpensive wine, yet it's also a little bit juicy and wild. Made in the fresh style that Borsao excels at. Drink now.",Monte Oton,87,7,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Borsao
57408,Spain,"Standard as good brut Cavas go, with yeast, citrus and a hint of matchstick on the nose. The palate shows a good fabric comprised of lemon-lime and apple flavors. Good up front but a little weak on the back end and finish. Still, as a whole this is perfectly good, affordable bubbly that does what it's supposed to do.",Aria Estate Brut,87,12,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
57410,Spain,"Tea, floral and black cherry aromas give this aging wine some character. The palate has held onto its darkness, thus plum, blackberry and coffee flavors are in charge. The palate is flat more than lively, but overall it's a good, toasty wine with some earthy complexity. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",Monastrell-Shiraz,87,13,Levante,Yecla,NA,Red Blend,Montgó
57411,Spain,"Roll out the barrels! This is one heavily charred, very toasty number. At first the oak seems forced, and always is it front and center. But with some time in the cellar, today's dark, resiny bitterness should subside. At least we hope it does, because the wine has structure, density and pretty good fruit. Definitely for folks not opposed to barrel influence.",Selección Crianza,87,24,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Ramirez de la Piscina
57413,Spain,"Quite rich and yeasty, with bold aromatics of baked bread and toasted corn. That rich, individual style carries onto the palate, which is sort of chunky and soft, with cidery flavors that finish thick and a touch sweet. A much heavier style of Cava made for near-term drinking.",Imperial Gran Reserva,87,NA,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Gramona
57414,Spain,"Clean and modest on the nose, with plump but standard apple and spice flavors. There isn't much unique or stirring about this wine, but it's flush and solid on the palate and fairly long on the finish. Perfectly good, with more yeast and size than most basic bruts. In addition, it's a little more pricey than the competition.",Brut Jove,87,17,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Gran Rigau
57416,Spain,"The bouquet provides plenty of kick as well as a hint of acacia. The palate is dry and full of green apple and nuts.

Not overly flavorful or complex, but a solid white Rioja for near-term drinking.",Monopole,87,18,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Viura,CVNE
57443,Spain,"Twenty months in oak has created coconut aromas to go with the ripe, sappy boysenberry scents that are draped on this studly, full-force RDD. The palate is a powder keg of massive blackberry, boysenberry and chocolate flavors, and the finish is like a retaining wall that keeps everything focused on the impressive midpalate. Great if you like 'em big. Imported by Fine Wines from Spain.",AlfaSpiga,93,54,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,O. Fournier
57466,Spain,"A lean and peppery style of Rioja that's very much from the old school. Red fruits such as raspberry and pie cherries steal the palate, giving the wine a tangy sensation and a spicy, almost sharp feel and finish. Very young and fresh right now; it improves with patient airing.",Crianza,86,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Salceda
57469,Spain,This Macabeo (Viura) blend is neutral on the nose but fairly big and bulky on the palate. Flavors of lemon-lime and banana are spritzy at first and then stickier late. The rest of the composition (Macabeo and Parellada) dictates that the flavors will be short; but what's on display is nice and creamy.,Proyecto Cu4tro Blanco,86,10,Catalonia,Catalunya,NA,White Blend,Bodegas Concavins
57473,Spain,"A powerful berry-based wine with no oak is what's on offer. The nose exudes rubber and leather at first, and then comes a wave of rambunctious black fruit. The palate is bright and packed, with ripe plum and cherry flavors. Shows good mouthfeel and chewy tannins. And once again: no oak!",NA,86,10,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Condado de Oriza
57474,Spain,"Persistently murky and leafy on the nose, this traditional-style Rioja brings juicier, brighter fruit to the palate along with some tangy, somewhat sharp acids. In the folds, a dash of oak brings vanilla and additional tannin into the picture. Improves with airing.",Crianza,86,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Loriñon
57575,Spain,"It's not easy to find mature Rioja from a great winery and a great year. This is all that; it smells of tobacco, earth and dried fruits. The palate is lively and not dying, while the flavors of cherry, raisin and marzipan are spot on. Compact and long on the finish, indicating that it still has another 10–15 years in it.",Prado Enea Gran Reserva,93,63,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Muga
57588,Spain,"Big and sultry as always, with bacon, smoke, black fruit and a full rack of spices making for a wonderful bouquet. Concentrated and ripped for a 2007, with blackberry, clove, pepper, cinnamon and vanilla flavors. And then comes tobacco and more spice on the finish, which is grabby but understandable because it's so young. Best from 2012 through 2019.",Malleolus de Valderramiro,93,176,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto Fino,Emilio Moro
57593,Spain,"Once again this is a stalwart modern-style Rioja with a mix of floral aromas, licorice, blackberry and coconut. The palate is both lively and subtle, and the flavor profile shows an impressive blend of cherry, plum, cream and cocoa, while the finish is long and smooth. A high-quality wine that should impress. Drink now through 2015.",NA,93,62,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,San Vicente
57665,Spain,"Wiry, scratchy raspberry aromas are a touch herbal but stop short of veering toward green. This blend is full, rubbery and a touch sticky in feel.

57676,Spain,"This dry, floral, exotic Rioja is a different breed of cat. The bouquet is jammy and herbal, with flowery notes.

Drink now.",Reserva,88,19,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Olvido
57697,Spain,"There's a nice shine to this slightly sweet but solid rosé out of Navarra. The bouquet is fresh for the most part, while the palate offers lively raspberry, citrus and melon flavors. A touch of residual sugar is sweetening things up, but overall it's very drinkable. Open right away or wait for the 2008 to arrive next summer.",Old Vine Rosé,87,12,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Garnacha,Red Guitar
57702,Spain,"If the choice is between sleek packaging and good product, take the product every time. And with Garnacha de Fuego, the product is sound to the point of surprising. A bouquet of huge berry aromas is the opening act, followed by flavors of red apple, kirsch and plum. Offers lots of fruit in front of a short, simple finish. And then it's time to open another bottle.",Garnacha de Fuego Old Vines,87,8,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Garnacha,Bodegas Ateca
57706,Spain,"Muga always makes a solid, clear-style rosé, and this one fits that mold. It's light in color, with peach, melon and mineral on the clean, steely bouquet. Narrow on the palate, with peach and citrus flavors. Shows a sly touch and will work with food.",NA,87,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Rosé,Muga
57708,Spain,"Not overly fruity up front; instead there's a strong hint of lettuce, greens and peach pit on the bouquet.

Finishes dry and firm, making it perfectly good in the $12-and-under category.",Cordon Negro Brut,87,12,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
57712,Spain,"Subtle aromas of white fruits, talc and powdered sugar are totally what they should be given that this is an extra dry Cava.

Shows good clarity from start to finish.",Extra Dry,87,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
57723,Spain,"Solid as can be, with sweet-styled aromas of berry syrup and tire rubber. In the mouth, the wine shows juicy cherry and raspberry flavors in front of a lively finish.

57729,Spain,"It's hard to rate an aging, oxidizing, barrel-fermented Verdejo and take into consideration the wine's faded qualities versus its complexities. If you like dried apricots, dehydrated mango slices and fruit jellies, then this will tickle your fancy. Adherents to the school that believes whites should be fresh and palate cleansing should take a pass.",Fuente Elvira - Fermentado en Barrica,86,22,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Pedro Escudero
57736,Spain,"This tiny production SB is sweet and easygoing, with canned peach aromas along with pineapple and mild citrus flavors. Roundness and a smooth feel work in the wine's favor, because there's just enough acidity to push the length on the finish. Drink right away.",Doña Beatriz,86,12,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Sauvignon,Bodegas Cerrosol
57737,Spain,"Smooth and friendly on the nose, with easy melon and peach aromas that give you confidence in the wine's core character. The palate is nothing special; there's citrus and pineapple before a medium-long finish. Solid but not the most expressive Albariño out there.",Selección,86,25,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Adegas D'Altamira
57741,Spain,"Starts out sharp and funky, and then quickly you realize that it's showing signs of age. The wine blends sweet and sour notes on both the bouquet and palate, issuing primary grapefruit flavors and some mustard greens on the finish. But the feel is chunky and it's losing its zest day by the day.",NA,86,15,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Vega de la Reina
57761,Spain,"This blend of six vineyards is great. It's dense and full of minerality, finely polished leather and pure berry aromas. The palate sings a melodious tune that begins with creamy oaky notes and expands to more defined plum, vanilla and fine herb flavors. The '04 Bembibre is a rounder, more complete version than the impressive but more austere 2002 (the last Bembibre we reviewed). It is immediately pleasing and keeps you on the hook to the end.",Bembibre,93,50,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Dominio de Tares
57945,Spain,"A pure and intense rendition of Priorato. The nose is stacked with minerality, smoke, ink and tough but regal black fruit aromas. It's powerful and concentrated in the mouth, with bold cassis and blackberry flavors in front of a long, flavorful, slightly lemony finish. Needs a few years to show its best; drink from 2011 through 2017.",Mas Sinén Coster,92,74,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Celler Burgos-Porta
57946,Spain,"A big-time Priorato with tobacco, minerality and dark fruit aromas in front of a lush and smooth palate full of cola, blackberry and licorice flavors.

57962,Spain,"Jammy but generic berry fruit aromas are crowded by lactic, pasty oak scents and vanilla. The wine is hard as cement in the mouth, with jagged tannins.

This could use more time; try after 2016.",Lo Mon,88,38,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Trossos del Priorat

57979,Spain,"Horsey, leathery aromas are earthy and funky, although with time blackberry notes rise up. The wine is lively, tough and offers bracing acidity. Flavors of herbs, licorice and lemony acidity support core blackberry fruit, while the finish is herbal and woodsy, with dark notes of espresso and black licorice.",NA,88,96,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Señorío de Caleruega
57986,Spain,Minerally black plum and boysenberry aromas set up a rubbery palate with medium weight and intensity.

57993,Spain,"Aromas of rubber, leafy red fruit and herbal raspberry are solid. It's crisp in the mouth, with raspy tannins supporting tight cherry and raspberry flavors. Finishes like it flows, with firm acidity and zest more than richness, leaving a hint of creamy vanilla and heat as it fades away.",Criança,87,48,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Morlanda
57994,Spain,"Muga has crafted a steely, no-fat Viura (with 10% Malvasia), despite the wine being fermented in barrel. The nose is clean and passive, while the palate is crisp and tight but largely neutral in its delivery of apple and lemon flavors. From a cool vintage, this wine is like kissing the razor's edge. Good stuff but limited in what it has in store.",Barrel Fermented,87,17,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Viura,Muga
57995,Spain,"The unheralded Tarragona D.O. delivers a basic winner in this varietal Tempranillo. It comes out of the gate well, with deep cherry, kirsch and coffee aromas. The palate falls off a touch from the promise of the bouquet, but overall the wine is generous and fruity and sincere. More balanced and complex than one might expect from a Catalonian value-priced red.",Old Vines,87,11,Catalonia,Tarragona,NA,Tempranillo,Nostrada
58002,Spain,"Citrusy on the nose, with just a hint of sulfuric burn and smoke.

Good but a touch flat on the back end and finish.",Cordon Negro Extra Dry,87,12,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
58004,Spain,"Both Freixenet and its sister property Segura Viudas put out myriad Cavas in this price and quality range. This one shows cherry candy on the nose and some seltzer. The palate is balanced between sweet red fruit and citrus, while the finish is dry despite some earlier sweetness. Bouncy and nice for a Pinot Noir Cava.",Aria Brut,87,12,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Pinot Noir,Segura Viudas
58019,Spain,"Nothing outrageous but this Garnacha, which now has a little age on it, is more than satisfying. The nose delivers cherry, plum and even a little cookie, while the savory palate features molasses, plum and spice. Subtle, composed and sort of old-school. Drink now.",Selección Reserva,87,18,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Garnacha,Bodegas Alconde
58033,Spain,"A little baked and flat smelling, with licorice and stewed fruit aromas. Sounds kind of dark and heavy, right? But the palate runs to the thin side, with lean but pure raspberry and cherry flavors. Vitality and snap are its virtues; not much depth or character are its fallbacks.",Reserva,86,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marques de Arienzo
58035,Spain,"Magenta-tinted and ready to go; that in a nutshell is this easy, no-oak blend of Tempranillo and Grenache. It's fruity to the max, with aromas of boysenberry and black cherry as well as similar flavors. Ripe and easy to drink.",NA,85,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,El Circulo

58040,Spain,"The winery has dialed back the time in oak for its barrel-fermented Viura to two months from five or six, and it's a decidedly less oaky wine than in years prior. Now it shows a controlled lees character along with lemon and apple flavors. Limited in what it offers, but made well.",Blanco Fermentado en Barrica,85,8,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Marqués de Cáceres
58046,Spain,"Oily and pungent, as if the cat were not let out of the house. But airing reveals a wide spectrum of green, yellow and orange fruits and vegetables. There's passion fruit, green pastures and some citrus in this varietally typical Rueda SB.",Montesol,85,19,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Sauvignon Blanc,Vinos Sanz
58055,Spain,"Very dark for Mencía, which indicates that it is an old-vines wine of pedigree. The nose is composed of cigar box, licorice gumdrop, balsam wood and berry fruit. In a word it's hedonistic, and the richness and full-bodied berry and plum flavors may just bowl you over. It's definitely more oaky than many, but it still qualifies as Bierzo at its most bountiful.",Tares P.3,92,90,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Dominio de Tares
58063,Spain,"Rock-solid Tempranillo that wows with its richness and depth, but also shows a touch of ripeness-based sweetness that critics could see as candied and simple. But that's splitting hairs, and we prefer to compliment the wine's dynamite intensity and its rangy finish. Maybe a touch bigger and less complex than Fournier's AlfaSpiga, but still excellent. Imported by Fine Wines from Spain.",Ribera del Duero,92,85,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,O. Fournier
58068,Spain,"A swaggering, slightly traditional holdover from the amazing 2001 vintage. This wine delivers cumin, pepper, turned earth and vanilla-infused berry aromas in front of a juicy, forward, complex palate featuring prime red-berry flavors along with hints of red pepper flake and tobacco. It still shows ample oak and vanilla but the fruit quality, tannins and structure can handle it. Drink now–2015.",Manuel Quintano Reserva,92,56,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Castillo Labastida
58247,Spain,"Really nice and lush, with an aromatic mix of tobacco, baked fruit, mocha, vanilla, shoe polish, earth and more.

Drink now through 2012.",Expression,92,59,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Alidis
58273,Spain,"Heavy char and cedar aromas sit atop green-leaning black-fruit scents. This is tight, juicy, acidic and woody on the palate, with shallow black-fruit flavors that are largely covered by charred oak. A zesty, toasted and tangy finish is full of life but falls short on complexity and depth.",JME,88,25,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Graciano,Bodegas Muriel
58281,Spain,"Rubber, cured meat and herbal berry aromas feed into a tomatoey palate with raw acidity and rough tannins. This features gritty flavors of berry and raisin, while the finish is a bit flat in feel and tastes of prune and stalky, roasted berries. Unlike many Ribera wines, this is earthy and not overly ripe. Drink through 2017.",24 Meses en Barrica,88,42,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Monteabellón
58296,Spain,"Rubbery, meaty and fully ripe smelling: that's the nose on this round and dark Monastrell. Yet while it hints at being bold and burly, the palate is more restrained and subtle. Don't expect a ton of stuffing, and instead look for savory plum and olive flavors in front of a short, stout finish.

58300,Spain,"There's nothing not to like about this affordable Spanish bubbly. The nose is a little candied and shy, but it's pleasant overall.

Fresh yet soft, simple and easygoing.",Carta Nevada Brut,86,9,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
58302,Spain,"Good but basic wine from southern Spain that shows cherry aromas with a citrusy twist. The mix is Monastrell with Syrah and Tempranillo, and as a whole it is composed, with berry, plum and other straightforward flavors. A plump, friendly sort of wine that isn't too complicated.",NA,86,12,Levante,Yecla,NA,Red Blend,Altos del Cuco
58303,Spain,"Campo de Borja's “everyman's” red rides again in 2007. Sure, it's sweet and candied, but that's the 75% Garnacha talking. Flavors of berry, plum and chocolate are bold and forward, though not very complex. Seems more lush and heavy than in the past. Good for those who don't want to think much about what they're drinking.",NA,86,8,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Red Blend,Borsao
58313,Spain,"Slightly more chunky and dusty than lively, with dry apple aromas and not much else. The palate offers a medium level of intensity and flavors of melon, banana and white pepper. Turns drier and more soda-like on the finish. Good but a little short on flavor.",NA,86,17,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Dom Bardo
58314,Spain,"A little cloudy and minty, with aromas of herbs and reeds bumping up against cherry cough drop. That medicinal cherry flavor joins plum and light pepper, while the feel is lively, bracing and forward. Gets better with airing, and overall it tastes a little more natural than some Jumilla heavyweights.",Monasterio de Santa Ana,86,12,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Casa de la Ermita
58315,Spain,"Stylistically speaking, this oak-aged wine is very different from all of Borsao's fruit-first Garnachas. And that isn't exactly a full-out compliment. So while the wine has balance and structure, the oak seems dominant on the nose and palate, which lends more vanilla and cream than spice and character.",Crianza Selección,86,16,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Red Blend,Borsao
58316,Spain,"Quintessential value wine from Spain is what you're getting with Viña Borgia's 100% Garnacha. The nose is candied for sure, but it settles to show the upside of Grenache rather than the weaker, more remedial side. Flavors of bright cherry and raspberry are high-toned and pure, and the finish offers a little pepper and edge.",Viña Borgia,86,6,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Borsao
58321,Spain,"Interesting and unique blends get bonus points, but in the long run this conglomeration of indigenous grapes from Mallorca is a touch too resiny and bland to really deserve a call out. But for soft melon and pithy flavors, and the fact that it's made from the obscure Prensal and Muscat, we like it well enough.",Quíbia,85,15,Spanish Islands,Vi de la Terra Illes Balears,NA,White Blend,Ànima Negra
58324,Spain,"A warm vintage (2006) may be causing this wine to expire prematurely, but tasted in 2008 it seems to be losing its drive. The nose has wild flower and melon aromas, while the palate shows simple apricot, pineapple and mango flavors. The tropical notes are here, but the texture is watery and as a whole it doesn't go the extra yard.",NA,85,14,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Sauvignon Blanc,Blanco Nieva
58332,Spain,"Approach this simple Tempranillo with modest expectations and the jammy cherry aromas and flavors will strike you as pure and fresh. Complexity and style are not part of the equation, but an unoaked raspberry character, length and correct balance make it worthy.",NA,85,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Spanish Vines
58349,Spain,"Clean, wet, a bit sweet and rather formulaic, this Verdejo has a soft, chummy personality and seemingly more than a dash of residual sugar. Still, it manages to push tasty apple cider, papaya and other fuller-bodied, less acidic flavors.",NA,85,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Verdejo,Tapeña
58358,Spain,"With each vintage this bruising Toro gets more comfortable and familiar. Yes, it's still a tannic behemoth with a ton of new oak, but under all that bluster there's wonderful Tinta de Toro blackberry, licorice and tobacco flavors. And the finish of mocha and more is better than any visit to Starbucks. Hold until 2009.",NA,92,73,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Campo Eliseo
58365,Spain,"This small-production, ultraexpressive Bierzo features dynamite structure and intensity, a clear reflection of old vines grown at altitude. The nose exudes minerality and dense black fruit along with a good whack of fine French oak. The palate runs for miles while distributing warmth, richness, chocolate, minerality and length. Already drinking well but will age nicely for another three to five years.",NA,92,80,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Paixar
58370,Spain,"It seems that all of Monsieur Magrez's new wines from around the world have a similar DNA: size, ripeness, plenty of new oak and ultimately quality. This big-boned Toro shows tons of ripe black cherry flavors darkened by bitter chocolate and espresso. It's immensely oaky now and should benefit from a couple to 10 years on its side. Imported by Bernard Magrez.",Paciencia,91,75,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tempranillo,Bernard Magrez
58371,Spain,"From what will go down as a legendary vintage, the '01 Lanciano is a full-boned but elegant wine with deftly balanced aromas of chocolate, mint, graphite and berry compote. The feel is satisfying and chewy, while the flavors of cherry cola, black plum and cocoa are pure and lasting. Good now through 2012. Imported by Monsieur Touton Selection, Ltd.",Viña Lanciano Single Vineyard Reserva,91,25,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas LAN
58373,Spain,"Some early gas and sulfuric aromas blow off from the nose, leaving meaty berry scents. This wine sports a natural personality; it mixes leather and herb notes with polished but not overdone berry and plum flavors. And the finish is rich with molasses and leather. Probably best from 2008 through 2012. Imported by Fine Wines from Spain.",Spiga,91,33,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,O. Fournier
58375,Spain,"This shows classic dill, vanilla and brambly fruit aromas. Meanwhile, the palate deals wave after wave of vanilla-infused red fruit. For classicists this will constitute a trip down memory lane; a testament to the greatness of 2001.",Viña Santurnia Reserva,91,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,R. de Ayala Lete E Hijos
58376,Spain,"This is truly a unique wine in the sense that hardly any Verdejos are fermented in oak. Not only that, the end result is stellar. There's soft buttercup aromas leading into a layered, vanilla-edged palate of spiced apple, melon and greens. The wine is round, substantive and it stirs interest. And for that we're grateful. Drink now through 2008.",José Pariente - Fermentado en Barrica,91,31,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Dos Victorias
58470,Spain,"Staunch red fruit aromas are a bit prickly at first, but within a few minutes they settle on mineral, herbs, anise and licorice. The palate has a firm but pure feel, and the tannins aren't too tough at all. Flavors of cassis, cherry cough drop and raisin are deep yet narrow, and just complex enough. Drink now through 2013.",Clos de l'Obac,92,87,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Costers del Siurana
58471,Spain,"Another great Tempranillo from Sierra Cantabria? Indeed it is. The nose bleeds cedary, sweet black fruit aromas and coconut, while the palate is pure and layered, with a lush feel and rich flavors of black fruits and chocolate. Long and lasting on the finish, and delicious overall. Approachable now but ageable for at least five years.",Cuvée,92,29,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
58481,Spain,"Thoroughly modern in style, with an oaky nose of campfire, spice, vanilla, sawdust and molten berry. The palate is solid and shows good vital acidity, while the flavors of blackberry are meaty and thorough, with hints of coconut, chocolate and cream. Seems a little more balanced and interesting than FB's richer, softer Selección.",NA,91,45,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Ferrer Bobet
58491,Spain,"Concentrated and sweet, with a baked, raisiny richness that maintains its clarity. The palate is dense but not punishing or tannic. Flavors of blackberry and prune veer toward syrupy, setting up a sweet, generous finish of fig paste and coconut. Modern-styled Rioja done right.",Seleccion Personal,91,55,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Abel Mendoza
58495,Spain,"A complete modern Rioja with cola, cassis and smoky aromas. Excellent mouthfeel and toasty black fruit and licorice flavors work well together, and the finish is refined, warm and peppery. Not an overly lush wine but it is generous and loaded with a bit of everything good: body, tannin, acidity, flavor and complexity. Drink now through 2014.",Reserva,91,27,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Muga
58583,Spain,"Aromas of burnt orange peel, apricot, cinnamon and clove are accented by wild herb and nettle scents. This is full, resiny and borderline cloying in feel, while flavors of blow-torched caramel, peach, dried mango and oak finish honeyed and spicy, but also bitter. Drink this amber, mature wine now.",Molino Real,88,60,Andalucia,Málaga,NA,Moscatel,Telmo Rodríguez
58586,Spain,"Plum, cranberry and blueberry aromas come with earth and ample oak. The wine is jammy and a touch lazy on the palate. Flavors of savory, baked plum and spicy, stewed berry fruits finish with leftover oak and spice flavors as well as a jammy feel.",Clàssic,88,20,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Grenache-Carignan,Onix
58602,Spain,"Ginger ale and a touch of powdered sugar give this extra dry Cava its proper sweet aromas. The flavors are solid, if you like candied orange slices and lemon-lime soda. Shows good mouthfeel and more than adequate freshness. Perfectly competent given that it's $9.",Extra Dry,86,9,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Cristalino
58605,Spain,"The bouquet delivers some of that creamy, corn-like smell that many Cavas show. There is also cereal and citrus to the nose. Flavors of nectarine, grapefruit and green herbs are fresh and in the lead, and the feel is soft-edged. Shows some green bitterness on the finish.",Brut de Bruts,86,20,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Gran Rigau
58608,Spain,"Probably not a Cava for wine snobs. But who says all wines have to be super serious and complex? This one shows cured meat, tarragon, sweet tea and Muscat aromas, while the flavors are pure lychee and honeydew. Frothy and sugary, but that's the spumante style. Best with birthday cake, etc.",Spumante,86,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
58616,Spain,"From the Freixenet group of wineries, Vionta is clean but more neutral than we'd like to see. You won't be offended by the wine's green apple and lemon flavors, which are wet, fresh and zesty. But you might like a touch more refinement and dimension. A good wine, but a basic one.",NA,86,18,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Vionta
58617,Spain,"Gets off early with fresh tomato, spiced red plum, tobacco and vanilla aromas. The palate is fine but tight, with herbal fruit flavors, pepper, tomato and sharp acidity. Finishes with olive and tomato notes. Not the sweetest or softest thing going, but good if you like Navarran wines and their patented herbal, red-fruit character.",Crianza,86,17,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo,Ochoa
58621,Spain,"This wine is a “product” in every sense of the word. It's consistent from year to year, and if you know Esmeralda, with its sweet blend of Moscatel and Gewürz, then you know that it delivers simple but pleasant lime, kiwi and cantaloupe flavors with a certain watery freshness.",Viña Esmeralda,85,15,Catalonia,Catalunya,NA,Moscatel,Torres
58623,Spain,"While we'd suggest waiting for the 2007 to hit the market, this softer-styled wine is showing mature melon, tropical fruit and bee's wax aromas in front of mild citrus, lemon and pineapple flavors. It has a medium-weight body and almost a honeyed roundness. Drink now.",NA,85,10,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Analivia
58627,Spain,"White raisin and touches of lettuce and celery give this multigrape blend some richness but also a bit of green character. The palate shows lemon, green apple and pineapple, and this lean quality is confirmed by the wine's modest 11% alcohol level. Drink now to catch it at its scouring, sorbet-like best.",Versatus,85,10,Galicia,Ribeiro,NA,White Blend,Bodegas Campante
58628,Spain,"Matchstick, mushroom and licorice nib aromas add character to this fading but textured wine that struggles to offer peach and nectarine flavors. Expect additional softness with each passing month, and along the way you should only hope to salvage some citrus, white chocolate and melon notes.",Gran Feudo Rosé,85,12,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Garnacha,Bodegas Julián Chivite
58634,Spain,"Dry black cherry and berry fruit shows some early chemical accents, and the wine stays sort of thin and hard all the way to the end. It's peppery and tight, with a simple dark-fruit personality. A little awkward at 14.5%.",Crianza,84,16,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Barzagoso
58652,Spain,"The traditional side of Rioja is exhibited in the wine's vanilla, dill and peppery aromas, but the palate shows lots of red fruit, butter and a core of perfect acidity and tannins. This is a consistent wine that doesn't overwhelm. If you're looking for Nuevo Classico heft, color and power, look elsewhere. Best from 2008 through 2014.",Imperial Reserva,91,48,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,CVNE
58654,Spain,"Clearly Bodegas Roda threw all its best fruit at its '02 Roda I: it's as smooth, succulent and ripe as we've come to expect from this front-line alta expression Tempranillo. There's oak, vanilla, tannin, resin and lots of studly red and black fruit to give you something to ponder. Good now and better in a couple of years.",Roda I Reserva,91,67,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Roda
58661,Spain,"From 80-year-old vines planted on steep slopes, this shows an early blast of buttery oak, but underneath there's mineral, coffee, lemon peel and potent fruit. Power and tightness define the palate, which is also intensely mineral as it teeters on the border of overoaked and leathery.",Carracedo,91,75,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Bodega del Abad
58662,Spain,"CVNE must have done a strict selection in chilly, wet 2002 to get a reserva that's this sound. The nose is a lovely, traditional blend of earth, leather, coffee, spicy wood and red fruits. The palate follows suit, showing raspberry, strawberry, plum and vanilla flavors. A great, understated wine from what was a forgettable year for most Rioja producers.",Cune Reserva,91,27,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,CVNE
58664,Spain,"An excellent Verdejo from Rueda is as good as fresh, crisp white wine from Spain gets. And the two Victorias that make José Pariente know their stuff. After an overly ripe 2005, this vintage shows more of Pariente's patented lemon, citrus and mango flavors. The feel of the wine is super solid and the finish is long and properly acidic. It's a treat for fans of Spanish whites.",José Pariente,91,17,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Dos Victorias
58666,Spain,"This is Descendientes' so-called starter Bierzo, but it rises above the tried and true value zone to exhibit mineral, crushed violet petals, graham cracker and pure dark-fruit aromas. The palate is smooth and plush, with lush black-fruit flavors, easygoing tannins and some creamy length. It's not as vivid as the 2005, but it's still mighty impressive.",Petalos,91,22,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Descendientes de J. Palacios
58770,Spain,"Somontano is not exactly prime real estate among Spanish wine regions, but Blecua, a four-grape blend led by Cabernet Sauvignon, is one of the best wines the region has to offer. Smoke, licorice, rooty cola and lemony oak aromas mix with flavors of blackberry, coffee, cola and roasted meats. It's a bit choppy and hard now, but time will help it along. A classy wine to drink from 2011 through 2016.",Blecua,91,100,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Red Blend,Viñas del Vero
58776,Spain,"A rewarding wine that isn't overly pricey or difficult to enjoy. Dark, lightly baked aromas hint at raisin and marshmallow, while the palate has a deep texture and vital acidity.

58778,Spain,"Earth, rubber, spice, oak and bold berry aromas give this a classic Ribera nose, while the palate is pure and sensual, with shining raspberry, strawberry and plum flavors.

58861,Spain,"Gold in color, with mineral, toast, baked apple and stone-fruit aromas, this Albariño is plump and mature on the palate. Flavors of peach, papaya and minerals finish long and peachy, with baked apple and minerally notes to the finish. This is showing its age; drink immediately or  wait for the 2012.",Selección Finca Monte Alto,88,25,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Fillaboa
58863,Spain,"Dusty, yeasty aromas of red apple skins, cherry and chocolate lead to a solid and true palate with a good bubble bead, moderate elegance and full flavors of plum, red apple, cherry and spice.

58864,Spain,"Boysenberry and blueberry aromas are accented by violet notes and cedary oak.

Drink now.",Cabernet de Familia Finca Los Cerrillos,88,19,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon,Montalvo Wilmot
58865,Spain,"Dust, lime, lychee, thyme and oregano aromas create a complex bouquet. It is round in texture but also juicy due to core acidity. Flavors of lychee, melon and spiced apple rest on a full body. Finishing notes of herbs and tropical fruits are fresh and appealing.",Selección Especial 1,88,18,Andalucia,Málaga,NA,Moscatel,Jorge Ordoñez & Co.
58869,Spain,"This mature Albariño is mellow on the nose, then wide and melony in feel. It's leesy but also healthy in terms of acidity, with flavors of papaya, melon and peach. It's flavorful for sure, but a touch bland on the finish.",Don Álvaro de Bazán,88,NA,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Granbazán
58871,Spain,"Cava from Rioja may not compute but it's definitely an approved category of sparkling wine. This is minerally and smells a lot like vitamins. The palate is round, moderately foamy and wide. Flavors of passion fruit, papaya and nectarine finish smooth, with an easy bubble bead.",Conde de Haro Brut,88,26,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Muga
58890,Spain,"The nose delivers a light but perceptible blast of sucking candy, children's vitamin and perfume aromas. The palate shows additional candied characteristics, but for the most part it's fresh and easy, with a good feel. Generic as a whole, but competent and satisfying.",Brut,86,12,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Conde de Subirats
58893,Spain,"The smell of honey and lemon-lime soda give this a basic but respectable opening. It's sort of foamy and plump in the mouth, with apple and green-herb flavors. Lacks a little touch but offers bouncy fruit and no overt faults. Imported by Winelink Imports.",Brut Nature,86,14,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Dibon
58896,Spain,"The neon pink color is a dead giveaway that Garnacha is the basis of this rosé. Smells spunky and quite fresh on the nose, with a touch of bubble-gum sweetness. Flavors of raspberry and cotton candy catch the tart and sweet sides of things, so overall it's offering a little of everything. Drink now.",Rosado,86,11,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Rosé,Ilurce
58898,Spain,"A little aggressive out of the chute, with a nose that's sort of raspy. The fruit on the palate is tangy and tastes like early picked nectarines with a lemon twist. Crisp and short, but very clean and focused.",Cordon Rosado Brut,86,12,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet

58900,Spain,"Age is beginning to show up on this gran reserva. It's a little raisiny and Sherried on the nose, while the palate is wiry but not exactly thin, with dry raspberry, pie cherry and plum skin flavors. Baked bean, caramel, vanilla and tobacco all play big roles on the finish, which is scouring and tight. Drink now; it's probably not going to improve with further age.",Viña Real Gran Reserva,86,56,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,CVNE
58902,Spain,"Aromas of cherry-chocolate and rubber are firm and a little closed. And such a bouquet doesn't really portend a flavor profile dominated by pink grapefruit and tight citrus. But that's really where this Cava rests: in the mouth, it's single-mindedly about pink grapefruit, which is fine if that's a flavor you like.",Brut Rosé,86,12,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Conde de Subirats
58903,Spain,"Savory and deep given the price, with dark color, obvious ripeness and even a touch of vanilla and mocha on the nose. Round in the mouth and immensely fruity, with plum and berry flavors blending with vanilla. Textured and medium-long on the finish. Good for everyday quaffing, especially in the cold fall and winter months.",Riscal 1860,86,9,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo,Riscal
58923,Spain,"A bit too much new American oak was thrown at this crianza, leaving minty, drying aromas that veer into the butter and dill range.

58926,Spain,"Cloudy in color, with tart rhubarb aromas. The palate shows some acidity and tang, with pink grapefruit flavors offering a shrill kick. But overall the wine has seen better days and has become limited in scope at this point.",Rosé,84,11,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,Condesa de Leganza
58927,Spain,"Fiery, hot aromas feature raspberry, burnt leaves, balsamic notes and earth. It's wild and jumpy in the mouth, with rhubarb and cranberry defining the tight, underdeveloped palate, while the finish is tangy and almost peachy. Shows many cool-year characteristics of a 2002.",Reserva,84,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Baron De Ley
58930,Spain,"Fresh peach and nectarine dominate the nose on this semisweet blend of Viura and Malvasia. The flavors are mostly melon and citrus, while the finishing touch is that of fruit cocktail. It's a touch sticky in the long run, but at least it isn't cloying or cooked.",Satinela Medium-Sweet,84,9,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Marqués de Cáceres
58934,Spain,"Aromatic notes of talcum powder and scented candles give this Bordeaux blend from Navarra a light, pleasant bouquet. But the palate is more starching and hard than ideal, leaving a spiky, jagged feel to the wine's raspberry and plum fruit. So rugged and jarring that food is downright mandatory. Ripped but punishing.",Ars Mácula,84,25,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Tandem
58941,Spain,"Rueda is best when it's fresh and dancing, but this 2006 is showing too many signs of the hot year from which it came. It's already tired and soft, with compost and mealy citrus aromas going head to head with grapefruit and marmalade notes. Tasted in December 2007, this was probably a tastier, fresher wine six months prior.",NA,84,16,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Martinsancho
58956,Spain,"For an old-school highlight, look for this lesser known selection-based Reserva, because good grapes from a good year should add up to good wine.

58960,Spain,"This is what Albariño is all about! The nose issues a salinic combo of salt water and sea shells along with green banana and melon, while the palate is jumpy, fresh, balanced and intriguing.

58963,Spain,"Smoky, alluring and sexy; this is a fine holdover from the excellent 2001 vintage.

58965,Spain,"Coffee grounds, some minty wood and lots of ripe fruit greet you, and the lower levels contain all the sweet, dark fruit and oak-based chocolate and vanilla one could ever ask for.

58971,Spain,"This is not a blow-you-away RDD, but it is a smooth, well-composed red wine with clean, alluring aromas and ripe-styled fruit flavors that touch on raisin but then pull back to black cherry and dark plum. With its integrated tannins and mild finish, this is ready to go now and should hold form for about five years, maybe eight.",NA,90,30,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Comenge
58978,Spain,"With red wines joven usually means a few months in oak. It seems as though this wine was made the same way; there's a kiss of popcorn and buttered toast to the lemon and melon nose, while the palate has life, texture and complexity.

59190,Spain,"A touch scratchy and rough on the nose, with pepper and leathery fruit aromas. The palate keeps that edge while offering peppery berry flavors and oak.

59193,Spain,"Even though it's a sweet-styled Cava, the nose kicks up lemon and apple aromas that are familiar as can be. The palate, however, is quite sweet and supports the Semi Dry labeling.

59201,Spain,"Ultra purple and sort of gummy and confected. But it's also pretty solid in the mouth, with tannin instead of flatness holding things together. Tastes like sweet dark plums and candy, while a hint of black coffee darkness enters on the finish.",Viña Berceo Crianza,85,18,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Berceo
59202,Spain,"The Borsao brand is a bargain pioneer, and while the wines aren't $4.99 anymore they are still squarely “value” oriented. This rosé is fairly steely and fresh, with pithy grapefruit and nectarine flavors. Lean and peppery on the finish, and ready to be consumed right away.",NA,85,8,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Rosé,Borsao
59206,Spain,"Already in the twilight of its lifespan, this is a friendly rosé with a little wiggle and kick. The palate sits on ripe nectarine and pink grapefruit, while the finish offers pepper and spice. A little pithy but pretty good if you get at it soon.",NA,85,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Rosé,Tapeña
59222,Spain,"Take the bubbles out of Cava and this is pretty much what's left. The nose is light, with peach and banana aromas. Tangy flavors of orange and pineapple are lively but lacking, and the finish is ripe but simple. For flush flavors and just enough zap, this is good.",Can Feixes Blanc Selecció,84,13,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,White Blend,Huguet de Can Feixes
59224,Spain,"Oily and citrusy, with pungent, almost nutty aromas that are at once exotic but simultaneously funky and sour. The palate hits with chopping passion fruit and citrus, but there's also some banana to contemplate. In the end, it's just too hard to embrace and go beyond a sip or two, which isn't a great testimonial.",Finca la Colina,84,30,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Sauvignon Blanc,Vinos Sanz
59246,Spain,"Sweet and chunky, like Hawaiian Punch. This is heavy and unctuous at this stage of evolution, with raspberry and ripe melon flavors. Round and no longer edgy. Wait for the 2007.",Rosé,83,9,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Grenache,Marqués de Reala
59249,Spain,"An oaky, awkward, lactic lug that offers a ton of wood grain, funky fruit and a hard, overly spicy mouthfeel. It's trying to do too much with smoke and mirrors; the raw material isn't there.",Cenit,83,47,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Zamora,NA,Tempranillo,Viñas del Cenit
59295,Spain,"This wine is at its peak and you may wish to wait for the 2006, but if you encounter this toasty, mineral-influenced Godello, go for it. The palate is loaded with peach, papaya and green melon, while the finish is creamy and smooth. With Gaba do Xil, the stateliness and simple pleasures of Valdeorras on are on full display. From Vinos de Telmo Rodriguez.",NA,90,13,Northern Spain,Valdeorras,NA,Godello,Gaba do Xil
59307,Spain,"Red fruit is the dominant player on both the raspberry-driven bouquet and the currant- and cherry-laced palate. In the mouth there's integrity, natural acidity and restrained oak as opposed to heft and unnecessary burnt coffee and chocolate notes. Very clean and well made wine with aging potential. Good upon release and will hold through 2015.",Finca Valpiedra Reserva,90,40,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Martinez Bujanda
59340,Spain,"Deep and dark on the nose, with licorice, cola and prune aromas. The palate is chunky and full, albeit a touch soft. Saturated flavors of cola, blackberry and chocolate define it as a rich, modern wine, and the finish is appropriately creamy and stacked with sweetness and depth. A lush blend of Garnacha, Cabernet and two indigenous varieties. Drink now through 2011.",Negre,90,20,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Red Blend,Jaspi
59342,Spain,"Opens with earth, tobacco, briar and nutty aromas. This is now aged to its best state, and while there's still some tannic bite, it's at a straightforward, mature place. Flavors of roasted plum and spice are classy, and the finish is reflective of a fine vintage. Drink now or in the near future.",Glorioso Gran Reserva,90,35,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Palacio
59363,Spain,"Dark and dense, with aromas of rich black fruits, grilled meat and a lot of oak. The palate is extracted but it's not the least bit hard or biting. Flavors of Concord grapes and blackberry are sweet, and the finish keeps its fruit. Could it use more minerality and toughness? Maybe, but as is it's very approachable. Drink now through 2012.",Selecció Especial,90,95,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Ferrer Bobet
59476,Spain,"Stalky aromas suggest animal hide and roasted fruit. The wine is rubbery, firm and leathery in feel, with plum, berry, raisin and other dark-fruit flavors. On the finish, it feels earthy and tastes like stewed black fruits and prune. Drink sooner rather than later.",NA,87,30,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Mas de Subirà
59479,Spain,"Initially this wine is flat and a bit chemical on the nose, but with time lime and tropical fruit aromas poke through. The mouthfeel is round but a little bland and broken up, while flavors of yeasty, bready tropical fruits and applesauce finish easy but flabby.",Selección Especial 1,87,18,Andalucia,Málaga,NA,Moscatel,Jorge Ordoñez & Co.
59493,Spain,"A bit of forward oak comes across on the nose, while mocha and pretty good berry fruit keep things focused. Like most Navarran wines, this is snappy and “red” in character, with herbal tomato and plum flavors. Classic finishing notes of olive and dill close things out.",Selección Reserva,85,23,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Alconde
59498,Spain,"A typically reserved Navarran wine is what this is. The nose offers dry red fruit, spice and not much else. The palate is mildly citric and herbal, but there's enough cherry and leather to carry things to a medium-length   finish of dill, vanilla and spice. A nice and simple food wine.",Crianza,85,13,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Red Blend,Señorío de Sarria
59508,Spain,"A little creamy, waxy and scattershot, but also far more exotic and different than most $8 wines. This is barrel-fermented Viura, but the oak level is light and manageable. Flavors of papaya, melon and citrus are almost tropical in scope, and the finish is pretty fresh. Drink right away for maximum freshness.",Conde de Valdemar,85,8,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Viura,Bodegas Valdemar
59550,Spain,"Quite brambly and funky, with a roasted “country” quality that points it toward leather and rubber. An organic wine with 80% Tempranillo and 20% Garnacha; it's sort of tangy and choppy on the palate, with a mix of awkwardly sweet and sour flavors.",Organic,83,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Greener Planet
59556,Spain,"Concentrated aromas of mocha, toffee and burnt coffee bound from the glass, followed by flavors of sour red cherry and berry. Sound balance and soft, dusty tannins make this wine easily enjoyable and easy to drink.",Alate Kosher,83,15,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo,J. Fernández de Arcaya Galdiano
59564,Spain,"So young and simple that one can only describe this as Albariño Nouveau. It's a bouncy, almost spritzy confection with pineapple, green apple and other thin citrus flavors. There's zero body to it, but it is fresh and snappy.",NA,83,28,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Mar de Frades
59592,Spain,"Deep and clear in color, and very solid smelling; the prune and mineral aromas form the base, with woodsy notes offering complexity. The palate is chiseled and juicy, with plum, berry, tobacco and espresso flavors. Best to drink now. Only 600 cases made; 125 imported.",Carracedo,90,67,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Bodega del Abad
59593,Spain,"A big surprise! This shows that it rates many levels higher than what $9 usually buys. The nose is smooth, clean and fresh, with a hint of lemon peel to accent raspberry. The palate is exuberant and balanced, with three-star feel. For unoaked Garnacha that's sure to please, this is where you should turn.",Saludo,90,9,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Garnacha,Bodegas Luis Gurpegui Muga
59602,Spain,"Plump and ripe in style, with a lot of charm to its personality. This is very nice and simple Tempranillo (with 15% Garnacha and Graciano), and it's ready to drink now. The feel is on the flush side, and there's jamminess to the palate along with light pickle notes and vanilla on the finish. Coming along nicely; this review reflects an improvement over a tasting done in May 2007.",Reserva,90,25,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Marqués de Cáceres
59645,Spain,"The label says it: fermented in barrel. And one sniff delivers the buttery, toasted character of a Burgundy or California Chardonnay. Underneath the oak, there's fine acidity and blazing apple fruit, and once it finishes you get a finely baked aftertaste. An interesting, elevated mix of Treixadura, Godello, Loureira and Albariño.",Fermentado en Barrica,90,20,Galicia,Ribeiro,NA,White Blend,Viña Mein
59662,Spain,"The opening of peach, mineral, honey and wild green herbs is alluring, and the palate runs smooth and full, and also a little soft and mature. Banana, papaya and melon flavors are pretty and the finish holds its stature. Not as minerally and tight as some; this wine has sweetness and depth. Drink soon.",NA,90,18,Northern Spain,Valdeorras,NA,Godello,Gaba do Xil
59669,Spain,"A treasure at this price. The nose is impeccably clean, with tropical fruit and honeyed melon aromas. Elegant in the mouth yet there's also just the right acidic pop to liven up the melon, kiwi and apple flavors. A pure, fruity ride. Treixadura, Torrontées, Loureira and Albariño comprise the blend.",NA,90,14,Galicia,Ribeiro,NA,White Blend,Viña Costeira
59763,Spain,"Dusty red-fruit aromas set up an easy, likable palate with a mix of citrus and briny apple flavors. There's good tang and acidity along with length to the finish. That briny character from the flavor profile comes back on the finish.",Brut Reserva Rosé,87,18,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Pinot Noir,Marqués de Gelida
59764,Spain,"Cedary oak, vanilla, tobacco and lemony notes blend with floral plum and berry on the nose of this Tempranillo-Cabernet blend. The mouthfeel is wiry and reduced in feel, while flavors of baking spices, wood grain, stewed berry and raisin finish minty, with licorice and anise accents. Drink now.",Colección Privada Finca Las Cerrillos,87,19,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Montalvo Wilmot
59785,Spain,"Gritty leather and raisin aromas suggest overripe fruit. In the mouth, this wine shows an expected jammy, plump mouhtfeel that's almost mushy. Flavors of blueberry, stewed plum and licorice finish loamy in feel and candied in flavor, with chunky weight and mild heat. Drink through 2016.",NA,87,24,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,L'Atzar
59786,Spain,Cherry and raspberry aromas are lively and inviting. This wine offers plenty of body and good balance for the price. Flavors of candied plum and berry are not complex but have support from density and weight on the finish.,Los Bohemios,87,10,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Garnacha,Jardín de Lúculo
59817,Spain,"Smells more meaty and leathery than you might expect for a basic, young Tempranillo. But enough berry fruit sneaks through to make it a solid but narrow wine driven by red plum and other standard red-fruit flavors. Finishes fresh but lean.",NA,84,11,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo,Rivera de Castilla
59857,Spain,"Young and a bit fiery at first, but give it time in the glass and it unfolds in a way that you would never expect for a wine of this price. Medium-bodied without any harshness, it has Mencía's typical soft tannins and berry compote flavors backed by a touch of char and vanilla. A super good wine that proudly represents Bierzo at the value level.",NA,90,13,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Luna Beberide
59859,Spain,A mile deep on the nose. The palate starts out grapy and jammy and then develops to show herb-infused plum and berry flavors. The finish of chocolate and black truffle ensures that this is a top-level wine. Drink now through 2014.,Tinto Crianza,90,34,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Pago de los Capellanes
59862,Spain,"Earthy and heavily toasted, especially upon first take. This is a serious multigrape wine from the outskirts of RDD that needs a few years in the cellar and then a decanting. With that TLC you will get saucy berry flavors, aggressive spice and tannins, and a dynamic, multifaceted finish. Drink it too soon or without airing and it may seem overoaked, hot and bitter.",NA,90,50,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Red Blend,Quinta Sardonia
59874,Spain,"Now this is Albariño! The nose sings a pretty tune, backed by aromas of white fruits, candle wax and flower blossoms. The mouth is perfectly racy but balanced, with forward apple, mineral and honeyed flavors. Get at this as soon as possible to enjoy Albariño's classic crisp, oceanic qualities. You won't be disappointed.",NA,90,15,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Condes de Albarei
59900,Spain,"Waxy and burning on the nose, and then very heavy and sugary on the palate. The orange marmalade and honey flavors are over the top and sticky, while the wine leaves an unctuous, resinous finish. Too much of this 15% Moscatel could cause a headache.",Vino Dulce Natural,82,18,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Moscatel,Señorío de Sarria
59907,Spain,"With 20% Garnacha, this Navarran Merlot carries a green and lactic streak that makes it a tough go. The palate is gigantic and oversaturated, which makes the whole clumsy and rough.",Palacio de Eza,82,12,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Merlot,Tandem
59940,Spain,"A little more herbal, stalky and tomato-influenced than the riper, fresher 2005, but still an elegant, complex wine that shines a positive light on this little-known region at the base of the Pyrenees. Tobacco, tomato leaf, root beer and bouillon flavors set up an herbal, almost Bordeaux-like finish. Layered and structured to boot. Drink now through 2012.",Blecua,90,100,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Red Blend,Viñas del Vero
59950,Spain,"Full and dark, with aromas of bacon, crusty minerality, black fruits and spice. Balanced yet bullish, with integrated tannins and toasty, coffee-infused flavors that go straight to black. Long and showing additional coffee on the finish. Drinkable now.",Crianza,90,30,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Felix Callejo
59961,Spain,"Aromas of leather, smoked meats, charred oak and lacquer are not for the weak, while the mouthfeel is firm, deep and just right. Juicy and bright in terms of flavors, with black cherry, vanilla and coconut. Toasty and alert on the finish, but with smacking tannins. Drinkable now and good for another four or five years.",Reserva,90,19,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Beronia
60074,Spain,"Fresh-cut oak is front and center on this now-aging blend of Monastrell and Merlot. There's a green, almost cheesy accent to the nose, which is followed by generic plum flavor. Always resiny and creamy due to the oak, with some prune to the finish.",Enciro Monastrell Merlot,84,10,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,El Bully
60082,Spain,"Mildly raw and reduced, but at $6 expectations shouldn't be too high. In the mouth, it's tangy and light, with zingy strawberry/raspberry flavors that have some scour. Bland but lively.",NA,83,6,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Casa Solar
60085,Spain,"Raw and rough more than flush or lush. The nose deals mildly pickled red-fruit aromas in front of a tight, acidic palate that tastes of pie cherries. Firm and zesty but not much length or substance. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",NA,83,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Herminia
60086,Spain,"Fizzy and foamy and aggressive. To give it a frame of reference, it is similar to Brachetto or Frascati from Italy, but it's clumsy on the palate and tastes too much like red licorice and candied fruit to be taken too seriously. Also a bit cloying on the finish. Imported by National Distributing Co., Inc.",Reynal Vino de Aguja,83,10,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Rosé,Pinord
60096,Spain,"Here's an affordable Bierzo red that earns big points for its straightforward, no-nonsense accessibility and balance. The bouquet offers ample minerality, a sprinkle of burnt toast and friendly red fruit. The palate is moderately deep and pure, with spice, pepper and vanilla on the finish. A fine reflection of the region and the 2005 harvest.",Pago de Valdoneje,90,14,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Vinos Valtuille
60111,Spain,"Old-vines Verdejo from Rueda can amount to something special, and this vineyard-select beauty has it going on. The bouquet is clean, with touches of saline, mineral and lime. The palate is mostly about freshness, but soon power and depth of fruit take over. And the finish is a whopper in terms of length and purity.",Pie Franco,90,20,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Blanco Nieva
60118,Spain,"Consistency is a virtue in this business, and this wine tastes almost exactly like the highly recommended 2005. The nose blends green grass and golden fruits, while the palate is clean, intense and snappy. This is a wine that sings, and the interspersed notes of bell pepper, grapefruit and mineral are just right for Verdejo. Drink right away for maximum freshness.",Valdelainos,90,11,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Pedro Escudero
60131,Spain,"Very dark and oaky, with lemon, bacon, charcoal and high-toned black fruit aromas. The palate is rich and warm, almost heavy, with intense blackberry, chocolate and figgy flavors. Shows very nice texture and size but also tips toward molten ripeness and heavy sweetness. Drink soon.",AlfaSpiga,90,47,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,O. Fournier
60138,Spain,"Dark, sweet and candied on the nose, with hints of raisin and licorice that become more prominent in the mouth. Saturated but also somewhat monotone and single-leveled in terms of flavor, where you get a narrow band of sweet black cherry and raisin in front of a short finish. Very nice as always, but not the best Allende we've reviewed.",Allende,89,26,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Finca Allende
60148,Spain,"A well-made and refreshing wine for the price. The nose is crisp and smells of nettles, grapefruit, cilantro and stony minerals, while the feel is zesty and the flavors bring a mix of green fruits, citrus and tropicality. Stays on point from start to finish. A fine wine for summer sipping.",NA,89,15,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Palacio de Bornos
60180,Spain,"A lot of wood sits up front, and in back of that things seem a touch murky and lactic. Freshness and precision are not this wine's best attributes, but there is decent weight and body carrying berry, tobacco and vanilla flavors. Would be better with more purity.",Pomar de Burgos Joven,84,14,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Pomar Viñedos
60182,Spain,"Hard-driving aromas of smoke and graphite drown out shy fruit, while in the mouth the flavors are more distant than ideal. The feel is typically deep and and tannic, while a lasting flavor of chocolate is a welcome finishing touch.",NA,84,10,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,"Vivir, Vivir"
60193,Spain,"Musky and leathery at first, with a hint of cough drop. And it never really gains its legs. The palate shows a pruny character along with some wayward acidity, while the finish is indifferent. Adequate but lacks elegance and appeal.",Pomar de Burgos Crianza,84,24,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Pomar Viñedos
60194,Spain,"As pink wine goes, this Tempranillo-Merlot is extremely forward, heavy and aggressive. The nose is loaded with raspberry and cherry aromas, but there's also alcoholic heat reflective of its 14.8% alcohol. In many ways this drinks like a medium-bodied red wine, meaning it's fuller and beefier than your usual lighter-framed rosado. Imported by Dana Importers, Inc.",Rosé,84,15,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo-Merlot,Prado Rey
60196,Spain,"Baseball card bubble gum and leafy spearmint aromas shade dark, dusty fruit notes, while the tannic palate houses mildly tart cherry flavors followed by hints of sucking candy and finally coffee. Decent but a bit overoaked and out of sorts.",NA,84,17,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Rubiejo
60206,Spain,"Torres claims to be serious about Ribera del Duero, but early on the Celeste wines, made from purchased grapes, are so-so at best. The 2004 is a touch damp and leathery on the nose, with toasty dark cherries as the driving flavor. It's got some weight but it's also drying and oaky on the finish. Needs some fine tuning.",Celeste,84,22,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Torres
60209,Spain,Pretty good except for some hardness and a touch of chemical that runs onto the finish. Along the way there are heavy aromas and rugged blackberry and dark plum flavors. Finishes full but drying toward the end.,Dominio De Nogara,84,10,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Valtravieso
60216,Spain,"Starts shy, but then reveals a smoky nose of dried cherries and freshly fallen leaves. Still fairly youthful on the palate, where plum and cherry flavors are braced by a ripping note of hickory smoke. Barrel notes take over on the finish, but overall it has a lot of what you want from a 21st-century Rioja.",Reserva,88,28,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Darien
60219,Spain,"Round and nutty, with mild floral and honey hints up front. The formula for Tio Pepe calls for a salty, crisp flavor profile with just enough complexity to thrust it into the upper echelon of finos. Slight mushroom and iodine notes appear on the finish.",Tio Pepe Fino,88,NA,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,González Byass
60221,Spain,"An example of a well-made, lightweight red that puts clarity and freshness ahead of bulk and oak. The palate is racy and slick, with some peppery spice and milk chocolate along with pure cherry and raspberry. Finishes warm, tight and spicy.",Crianza,88,19,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Marques de Tomares
60236,Spain,"La Ina always has its own likable style. It's fresh, with plenty of apple character, and always dry as a bone. Maybe it won't overwhelm or surprise, but if served properly chilled, La Ina always satisfies. A quintessential aperitif with tapas and finger foods.",La Ina Fino,88,14,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Domecq
60237,Spain,"Sweet and candied on the nose, which  draws you in. Runs a touch chunky, with plum and licorice flavors. Good acidity creates a racy mouthfeel, even teetering on fiery. Tight on the finish, but crisp and fresh. The blend is 80% Cabernet and the rest Merlot.",Reserva,88,NA,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Enate
60239,Spain,"Full and fresh, with pungent leather, tobacco and red-fruit aromas. On the mark in terms of feel, with laudable plum, cherry and earth-like flavors. Entirely holes-free, with ripeness that matches the wine's smooth texture.",Crianza,88,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Vallobera
60360,Spain,"Garnacha-Cabernet Sauvignon is the blend and it's showing some age. The nose is a little heavy and murky, and so is the palate. Flavors of melon and papaya are more plump than zesty and driven. Falls rather flat on the finish. Wait for the 2008.",NA,83,8,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Rosé,Vega Sindoa
60365,Spain,"All over the map. The nose offers toast offset by gym sweat, while the palate is both tangy yet pickled, with zingy orange flavors. The wine flows across the tongue but leaves a bit of citrus rind and vinegar. Not bad per se, but has some weak links. Imported by Winelink Imports.",Demi Sec,83,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Dibon
60366,Spain,"Big in color, with meaty, rubbery aromas that seem reduced and gaseous. The palate is black and toasty, but sort of rubbery. Burnt toast, black coffee and some bitterness control the finish. More colorful and big than flavorful and complete.",Vino Joven,83,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Lar de Sotomayor
60374,Spain,"A bit too rubbery and gassy to qualify as “clean,” with leafiness running the bouquet. The palate is sort of flat, with raisin, baked cherry and prune flavors. It's on the borderline of being stewed.",Tinto,83,9,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Agustín Cubero
60378,Spain,"Not super fruity. Instead it's a generic, racy specimen with lots of zap, kick and zest but not much style, warmth or fruit. Shows fiery flavors and a tight, driving finish. Expect many 2007s, including this one, to be on the miserly side.",NA,83,11,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Campellares
60380,Spain,"As a young wine, this is bold, dark, crusty and slightly out of joint. There are salty, balsamic flavors along with muscular berry notes, and then butter and other barrel-driven flavors on the finish. It's chunky bordering on huge, with balance and integration issues. Maybe a little better in six months.",Saludo,83,11,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Luis Gurpegui Muga
60382,Spain,"Gummy, pasty and sweet, with no real elegance or finesse. It's simply a dark, candied wine that's pure tutti-frutti. And the feel is more narrow than one might hope for given the wine's immense color and body.",El Chaparral Old Vine,82,13,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Grenache,Vega Sindoa
60389,Spain,"Toasty and rubbery aromas lead to a drastic, rather sharp palate of brazen red cherry and plum. More tang and pickled than rich and rewarding, with a fiery mouthfeel and scouring acidity.",NA,82,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,El Circulo
60392,Spain,"Leather, baked berry fruit and coffee make up the nose, while the palate is tight with cherry, raspberry and zesty acidity. This wine could use a few more years of bottle time, and then maybe that pronounced acidity will soften. If not, it is going to seem a little thinner than it should be for $125.",Pagos de Viña Real,89,125,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,CVNE
60393,Spain,"This wine shows Viura at its most elegant and expressive. It has weight, balance and body along with tangy lemon drop flavors. If you like pure but weighty citrus with a touch of mineral and brine, this has it. Better than most Viura by leaps and bounds.",Cune Monopole,89,16,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Viura,CVNE
60405,Spain,"Young and vibrant; it's straightforward Albariño from a good vintage. In the mouth, expect green melon and stone-fruit flavors backed by solid acidity and a bit of fleshy weight. It's comfortable around the edges, and overall it's sure to satisfy fans of this type of crisp, clean white wine.",NA,89,17,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Gundian
60420,Spain,"Nice on the bouquet, with aromas of licorice, tobacco, earth, mineral and solid berry fruit. The palate is a blend of power and smooth tannins, and the flavors of black fruit tilt toward fleshy, with buttery oak as an accent. A little flat on the finish, with herbal notes, toast and fig spread. Ready to drink.",Crianza,89,32,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Resalte
60421,Spain,"Initiates with savory, mildly soupy aromas on top of berry fruit. The palate is plump, ripe and balanced, with mocha, coffee and dark, meaty berry flavors. Toasty, dry and very solid on the finish, and convincingly rich as a whole.",JC,89,24,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Vizcarra
60423,Spain,"Miserere offers most of what you'd expect from a high-end Priorat red. The nose features mineral, grilled meat, raisin, berry, cherry and even a citrusy accent. The palate has a full, complete feel and warm flavors of black cherry, licorice and raisin. Very nice but one step short of excellence. Drink now through 2012.",Miserere,89,80,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Costers del Siurana
60427,Spain,"Toasty, earthy, chocolaty and meaty, but not overly fruity or sweet. The palate features solid structure and body, with rooty raspberry, plum, nutmeg and other spice-based flavors. A little rough and short on the finish, with firm tannins. Gets better the longer it sits, so decant or let breathe before pouring.",Cosme Palacio Reserva,89,25,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Palacio
60428,Spain,"Baked, roasted and earthy, with a deep palate of plum, berry and spice aromas. We wouldn't label this a complex or complicated wine; what you smell and taste initially is more or less what you get. Spicy and chocolaty on the finish, and satisfying.",Tábula,89,29,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas y Viñedos Tábula
60435,Spain,"Having not seen the Valsacro wines for several years, it's nice to know that they are up to good things. This is a dark wine dominated by aromas of cassis liqueur and earth. It's lively and structured, with layers of toasted berry, chocolate and black pepper flavors. Shows a lot of shadings and trimmings, including creamy oak on the finish. Drink now and over the next two years.",NA,89,31,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Red Blend,Valsacro
60436,Spain,"Aromas of mineral and jammy raspberry are attractive, yet the palate seems a bit metallic and clicky, with hard to penetrate flavors of rooty fruits, vanilla, coconut and cola. Opens with airing to display secondary berry fruit flavors in front of a tough, firm finish. Nice and ripe, and ready to drink.",Furvus,89,34,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Red Blend,Vinyes Doménech
60444,Spain,"Solid as a rock, with earthy berry and mild herbal aromas. The palate is firm and a touch angular, with sweet raisin, blackberry, candy and chocolate flavors. Long and steady on the finish, with a nice mix of freshness and richness that serves it well. Drink now through 2013.",NA,89,NA,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Mas Dels Frares
60492,Spain,"Heavy fruit in the form of raisin controls the nose, while cranberry and rhubarb flavors anchor a surprisingly tart, red-fruit driven palate. Not sour per se, because there is core sweetness, but it just seems rough, snappy and sharp throughout.",Tamiz Joven,83,15,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Reyes
60504,Spain,"Light in terms of fruit potency, but heavy on the spicy oak. This is your typical dry, lean, somewhat shallow Tempranillo with spice and vanilla as the dominant forces. Some red cherry is evident in the mix.",6,83,14,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,Valdrinal
60510,Spain,"Hailing from a more obscure mountainous region, this Chardonnay-based white blend is a potent brew. The nose offers pointed lime, citrus and cream aromas, which are followed by vanilla-tinged pear and spice flavors. Big boned yet clean, with a piquant finish.",Clarion,88,NA,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,White Blend,Viñas del Vero
60511,Spain,"Begins with mature aromas of toast, sugared pastry and yeast. Ultra dry in the mouth but flavorful, with almost sterile apple and spice flavors. Crisp but forgiving on the finish; a good match for poultry.",Torre Galimany Brut Nature,88,NA,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
60515,Spain,"Impeccably clean, with light tropical fruit gracing the bouquet. A wine that's better than the sum of its parts; the palate is lemony fresh and satisfying, while the overall impression is that of elegance and simplicity. Perfectly good but not overly flavorful.",Pazo Piñeiro,88,35,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Lusco
60518,Spain,"Sweet and grapy on first look, but shows more complexity once you get into it. Rich plum and other black fruits carry the bulky, sizable palate. The finish offers oak in the form of chocolate and mocha. Devoid of serious nuance and depth, but charming in an easy, fruit-forward way.",Albares,88,11,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Dominio de Tares
60519,Spain,"Leathery and smoky, with woodsy aromas as well as the essence of dried red fruits. Like many classic Rioja, it's a touch racy and acidic, but that zest pushes the cherry, cranberry and raspberry fruit toward an even finish. As a whole it's snappy, with a solid core.",Coto Real Reserva,88,42,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,El Coto
60520,Spain,"The crude oil of PX Sherries, Noe won't appeal to everyone. For starters, it's thick as molasses, with heavy caramel and toffee aromas and flavors. And while there's nothing not to like about caramel and toffee, this wine is fat and chewy, arguably too viscous to drink with ease.",Noe Muy Viejo,88,NA,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Pedro Ximénez,González Byass
60524,Spain,"Starts with a big, dusty nose of cherry, blackberry and forest notes. Fresh and proper on the palate, with plum and boysenberry. Finishes with vanilla and toffee, while the feel is warm and round. Very functional and moderately complex.",Reserva,88,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Vallobera
60525,Spain,"There's not a region or grape type that Telmo Rodríguez won't tackle, and here he's on to Moscatel in the deep south. This wine exhibits lilac aromas with hints of smoked ham and hard cheese. It's not a perfect bouquet, but it is intriguing. In addition, look for a bulky but rewarding palate featuring chewy sweet fruit and moderate acidity.",Molino Real Mountain Wine,88,48,Andalucia,Málaga,NA,Moscatel,Telmo Rodríguez
60535,Spain,"Kicks off with a bouquet akin to chocolate-covered cherries before moving on to cured meat and bacon. Strawberry and cherry flavors are touched up by buttery oak, while the finish is so broad that it seems like pulled dough. Shows much of what's good about this appellation.",Reserva,87,24,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Valdubón
60537,Spain,"Begins with tight sulfuric aromas that transform into rubber and red fruit. Flavors of cherry, plum and dried herbs are tart and precise, while the finish offers some tomato. Overall it's a solid, tight wine that gets better with airing.",Reserva,87,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marques de Ulia
60538,Spain,"This well-priced red from Tarragona shows a glimpse of what the Montsant region can produce. The nose is all red fruit, with a splinter of oak. The palate is chunky and easy as it deals blackberry and raspberry in spades. Chocolate and mocha on the thick finish should please the sugar mavens.",NA,87,12,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Red Blend,Fra Guerau
60631,Spain,"A different breed of cat. The nose is akin to nail polish and sweet perfume, while the palate is super simple and doesn't rise much above liquid candy. Not awful but not challenging or refined. Has a lasting simple jamminess that isn't elevating.",Old Vine Seleccion,82,9,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Mirone
60637,Spain,"Violet in color but sassy. The nose is pickled and brambly, while the palate offers crusty berry fruit and herbal, marinated flavors. Edgy and sharp as feel goes, with an angular, acid-driven finish.",Heredad de Las Suertes,82,14,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodega San Pedro Apóstol
60640,Spain,"Tobacco, spice and cranberry aromas mix with nutty leather and sweat. This is a tangy, choppy wine with more tomato and citrus flavor than ripe berry fruit. So even for fans of classic Rioja this will seem light, lean and leathery.",Antaño Crianza,82,9,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,J. Garcia Carrion
60643,Spain,"A little jammy up front, but mostly this is dull and bland, with generic citrus-inspired flavors and some bitterness late. Can't see this really helping out food or standing alone as an apéritif.",Rosé,82,6,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Casa Solar
60644,Spain,"Mami Mia, this is heavy stuff. The nose on this Garnacha-Graciano mix is muddled and rubbery, while the palate is saturated but murky. Finishes almost salty, with a hint of the veggies. A loud wine that doesn't really say anything.",NA,82,13,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Garnacha-Graciano,Casita Mami
60650,Spain,"No Time is the name but unfortunately there's no substance and no richness. As a whole, this Garnacha smells of bramble and pickle, while the palate is fresh and bouncy but sour.",Garnacha Cepas Viejas,81,11,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Garnacha,No Time
60652,Spain,"Despite basic strawberry and red licorice aromas, this wine is decidedly tart. It hits with snappy nectarine flavors and then turns citric and finishes up sour. Doesn't offer much rosé pleasure; makes you wonder what's the point.",Rosé,81,11,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo,Rivera de Castilla
60654,Spain,"Flat and loamy on the nose, and then slightly floral. There is not much going on here; the palate offers distant strawberry flavors accented by pickle, and the finish is thin, tangy and hints at tomato. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",Excelsus,81,23,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Viña Herminia
60657,Spain,"This wine doesn't do much for Navarra's reputation as prime Spanish rosé country. It's a little burnt and acrid, with weak and muddled raspberry and pickle flavors. Finishes dry as a soda cracker.",Rosado,81,10,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Rosé,Señorío de Sarria
60675,Spain,"This high-priced 2003 parcel-based Tempranillo hits with funky citrus peel and wet clay aromas, which are followed by cherry and savory, almost stewy berry flavors. The heat of 2003 is evidenced on the soft, hollow finish. It's a very good wine with character and typicity—but for $225?",Parcela El Picón,89,225,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Pago de los Capellanes
60692,Spain,"Rooty smelling, with cola, sarsparilla, spiced meats and leafy berry aromas. The palate is plump and soft but healthy, with round, sweet berry fruit flavors and ample spice. A generous wine that's hefty, broad and ready to drink. Impressive given that its run is 45,000 cases.",Crianza,89,29,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Matarromera
60695,Spain,"An immense, heavily concentrated and sweet wine with aromas of bacon, wood smoke, citrus peel and jammy berry. The palate is rich and unctuous, so much so that it might qualify as syrupy in some circles. The flavors run toward roasted berries, fig paste and chocolate, and all totaled it's bold but a little overripe. Drink now.",NA,89,77,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,O. Fournier
60705,Spain,"Some patience is required to plow through the early aromas of cherry cough drops, bitter chocolate and smoke, but once you make it past that the wine turns decidedly red and fresh. The palate has tang and a citrusy quality, while flavors of zesty red fruits hint at lemon and pie cherry. A high-toned wine that's ready to drink now and over the next five years with lamb or beef.",Reserva,89,40,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Finca Valpiedra
60706,Spain,"Aromas of apple, fresh hay, pineapple and natural vanilla draw you in, while the palate is lively and fresh, with citrus, pineapple and pithy lemon flavors. Juicy, clean and zesty on the finish, and chiseled in terms of structure and acidity. Very nice Albariño for the price.",Pionero Maccerato,89,15,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Viña Almirante
60711,Spain,"Black as night, with chunky, sweet, candied aromas as well as notes of bacon, shoe polish and cough medicine. This is a classic modern-styled wine with intense roasted berry, herb and exotic spice flavors. Licorine, prune, coffee and oak emerge on the broad finish. Very ripe yet it does a good job of straddling the line between big and overripe.",NA,89,16,Central Spain,Almansa,NA,Red Blend,Atalaya
60750,Spain,"Smells a lot like a pot of baked beans, meaning it's not that fresh and probably too earthy for most tastes. The palate offers mostly cherry tomato and green herbs on top of dried cherry, while the finish, which has a good feel to it, tastes too much like tomato.",Roble,82,20,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Valdrinal
60769,Spain,"Flat, murky and mildly vegetal on the nose, and no matter how many times you swirl and sniff that's what comes out of it. Bottom line: it's a stewy, pruny Tempranillo with baked flavors and hard tannins.",y Llanahermosa,81,36,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Montecastro
60771,Spain,"There's really no good reason why a reserva from such a fine year like 2001 should be so thin and tart. But in this case, that's what we're dealing with. The nose offers earth, tobacco and red fruit aromas, but the palate is all acid and in the end everything seems stripped down and sour. Imported by Dana Importers, Inc.",Reserva,81,35,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Prado Rey
60772,Spain,"A sweet, clumsy wine with gumball aromas in front of a funky palate that deals hints of vinegar and olives along with candied fruit flavors. Not a very good wine but drinkable.",NA,80,NA,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Gormaz
60775,Spain,"With 14% Cabernet and Merlot added to prime Tempranillo, this wine jabs early with toasty oak, forest floor and roasted berry aromas, and then follows it up with full-bodied blackberry fruit accented by tobacco, leather and warm earth. It has body but also a firm, acidic core; and the tannins are totally manageable. Already drinking well but will improve over the next two to five years.",NA,92,35,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Finca Villacreces
60776,Spain,"Round, meaty, colorful and full of oak, chocolate and ripe fruit aromas. The palate is big and broad, with plum and boysenberry leading the troops. The mouthfeel deals some choppy tannins but all in all the wine has the right stuff, meaning it tastes fairly regal and offers a well-rounded feel.",NA,90,29,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Valderiz
60777,Spain,"Viña Mayor has been around for ages; in 2005 its young wines show huge fruit, nuance and quality. This basic youngster rides high with boysenberry flavors followed by toast, earth and mushroom on the finish. Smells and tastes better than its price.",Roble,88,10,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Mayor
60882,Spain,"Offers an attractive mix of herb, oak and ripe fruit aromas. The palate is sunny, and thus bright fruit in the form of raspberry and cherry shines. Full and lengthy on the finish, with chocolate as the lasting flavor.",Hacienda de Susar,87,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marqués de la Concordia
60899,Spain,"Thinning, but with catchy aromas of leather, citrus peel, forest floor and cola. The palate offers sweeping dried fruits, mostly cassis and cherry. Meanwhile, the finish is tight and guarded by mature tannins and vital acidity. Interestingly, root beer and turnip show up at the very end.",Gran Reserva,87,23,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Montecillo
60905,Spain,"A dud given that this is the winery's top effort. It's green and vegetal, with ashtray aromas. More like salad than wine. Not too many wines these days are blatantly bell peppery, but this is.",Reserva Especial,80,40,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Red Blend,Señorío de Sarria
60936,Spain,"This small-batch, single-vineyard heavyweight has a lot of stuffing, power and tannin, but it's also a rough ride, meaning the fruit and tannins hit like a jackhammer. But with good fatty foods and some decanting, the beast can be tamed. As for flavors, it delivers mostly plum and chocolate.",Pago la Jara,89,57,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Telmo Rodríguez
60947,Spain,"Having never tasted Heras Cordon's wines, the verdict is in: the current releases are all winners. This basic Reserva is lighter in frame, buttery and full of dill and red fruit; with air it settles to show ripe strawberry and raspberry notes as well as good structure. Perfect for drinking now.",Reserva,89,42,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Heras Cordon
60956,Spain,"Mineral, crushed flowers, black olive, dark fruit and herbs carry the hefty bouquet toward a round, earthy and fully packed palate that offers accents of cured meat, leather, creamy oak and some heat. It's definitely a big wine that's warm on the finish, but not tannic. A good deal at $16.",Baltos,89,16,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Dominio de Tares
60995,Spain,"A nicely made and easy to like kind of young Ribera red with clean, bold blackberry aromas and flavors that fit the wine's big, tannic structure. Composed on the back palate and beefy on the finish. Perfect for grilled meats. Drink now through 2012.",Viña Pilar Crianza,88,22,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Felix Callejo
61003,Spain,"Dark in color and hefty for an '07, with vanilla, balsam wood and berry aromas. The feel and body here are appropriate, while the flavors of black cherry and plum are snappy, direct, pure and clean. Bold, lively and nice, but nothing too complicated or powerful.",Spiga,88,31,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,O. Fournier
61004,Spain,"This is a higher-end blend from Onix, and it offers an earthy, almost compost-like opening with leafy notes of tobacco, coffee grinds, leather and hard cheese. The palate is solidly built, with cheek-blasting berry and coffee flavors. Toasty on the back end, with bitter chocolate. Very big but lacks some precision and purity of aromas and flavors. Drink now through 2012.",Fusió,88,32,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Onix
61005,Spain,"Roasted and dark on the nose, with raisin, prune and exotic spice aromas. The palate is chewy and a bit lemony, with sweet baked fruit flavors and a load of chocolaty richness. Mocha and fudge are the key finishing notes, and overall this is a proper yet full-bodied big boy.",NA,88,44,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Valpiculata
61010,Spain,"Big, bawdy, hard and concentrated, with black fruit and floral aromas. The palate is grabby and fully tannic, while the flavors run toward blackberry, coffee and vanilla. Rich and espresso-like on the finish, with no shortage of oak and richness. Very big at 15% alcohol.",Crianza,88,57,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Pago de Carraovejas
61011,Spain,"Fruity, minerally and nice, with aromas of pear, apple and pineapple that make you want to take a drink. The palate is juicy and fresh, with slate-driven green apple and citrus flavors. Quick on the finish, with a revisiting of the wine's mineral component.",Alma de Blanco,88,15,Galicia,Monterrei,NA,Godello,Pazo das Tapias
61176,Spain,"Broad and rubbery, with ripe black fruit and citrus peel on the nose. Good on the tongue, with a solid mouthfeel. And the finish is   attractively marinated, offering hints of soy sauce, molasses and sea salt. Fresh enough, and definitely forward in thrust.",Reserva,87,34,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Valenciso
61178,Spain,"Chunky and ripe, with more power and potency than precision or finesse. Which still means it's pleasant, warm and tasty. The   palate offers ample raisin and toffee, while the finish is aptly spicy. Good heft and texture, but short in the midsection.",Crianza,87,16,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Lealtanza
61179,Spain,"Looks good in the glass, and smells pretty nice despite a hint of barnyard. In addition, there's cola, vanilla and plum to consider. Fairly meaty in terms of feel, but not overly expressive and not quite reaching the upper echelon. Finishes with some gritty, hard-fighting tannins.",Crianza,87,31,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Páramo de Guzmán
61187,Spain,"Leathery and maturing, as the fruit seems to be on the fade. Dry cherry and raspberry notes carry the aging palate, which is bolstered by ample vanilla. Finishes warm, with licorice and pepper notes. Likable and more traditional, but drink soon.",Reserva,87,14,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Red Blend,Bodega Jario
61193,Spain,"Quite hard on the nose, with classic petrol aromas that almost smell of rubber cement. Tough and tight on the palate; it takes some effort to penetrate. Once inside there's crisp apple and lime zest. A true “nature” in every sense.",Reserva de la Familia Brut Nature,87,20,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Juvé y Camps
61197,Spain,"Plump and fruity, with aromatics of tobacco, leather and dark fruits. Features sweet, sturdy black cherry and plum flavors before a finish of warm earth, plum and vanilla. Very straightforward in its approach, but solid on all accounts.",Crianza,87,19,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,Blasón de San Juan
61198,Spain,"A bit of brett and barnyard on the nose, with minty raspberry coming on to take over. A little leafy on the midpalate, but not what you'd call green. Bitter chocolate carries the finish. A blend of five red grapes, a couple of which are local and virtually unknown.",Marboré,87,34,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Pirineos
61246,Spain,"A touch grassy and raisiny at first, but soon it gets into step and shows cleaner, fresher spice and cherry notes. For an average vintage, this is a nice wine with pepper, mildly jabby tannins and lots of oak. With air it settles nicely, and with food it should make for a good partner.",Selección,88,39,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Estancia Piedra
61249,Spain,"Hard smoke and raspberry aromas are balanced and pure, and the mouth is ripe, juicy and bright. This makes its point with subtlety and smoothness. It's not a bumpy, aggressive wine as it holds its balance all the way to the end.",Roble,88,14,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Abad Dom Bueno
61254,Spain,"Nice Albariño, no ifs, ands or buts. The nose is floral and clean, and that's backed by a no-fuss palate of citrus, namely orange and grapefruit. As it holds form from front to back, you know this is a good wine. Will go great with light salads and shellfish. Drink immediately.",NA,88,12,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Nessa
61261,Spain,"Floral and lighter bodied, with attractive red fruit aromas and a modicum of exotic spice. The palate is tight, pure and a little sharp and pointed, while the flavors are of flashy, zesty raspberry. A juicy wine that treads lightly rather than with a hammer.",C21,88,25,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto Fino,Cepa 21
61263,Spain,"Leafy and spicy, with notes of paprika, tomato, dried leaves and broth. But in the mouth, it's fresh and vital, with good balance and flavors of dried cassis, tobacco and herbs. For an older wine from industrial Valdepeñas it's doing a good job. But now is the time to drink it.",Gran Reserva,88,15,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,NA,Tempranillo,Anciano
61264,Spain,"Smoky and dry, with aromas of tire rubber and mildly herbal, leafy red fruits. The palate has a dry, rugged, scratchy feel while the flavors veer toward baked raspberry, earth notes and coffee. Finishes nicely, with berry fruit at first and then herbal, oaky afternotes.",NA,88,19,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Arrocal
61271,Spain,"Dark and very toasty, with espresso, bacon and roasted black fruit aromas. Tight and drying in the mouth, with biting tannins, a lot of oak and finally mildly herbal flavors of blackberry and burnt toast. Hard and dark, but big and boisterous, with a blatant barrel influence.",Abuela Cleofé,88,50,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Paramo de Corcos
61276,Spain,"Leather, tobacco, citrus peel and herbs make for a controlled bouquet that doesn't smack you in the face. The body, however, is tannic and grabby, while the flavors of sweet berry carry a roasted angle and a dash of spice. Chocolaty and spicy on the finish, but again it goes down hard and tannic, which is a drawback.",Reserva,88,70,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Resalte
61282,Spain,"Very sweet and rich, and probably a little too much so for some folks. Aromas of cassis, berry liqueur and black fruit candy are sweet, sweet, sweet, but after the sugary richness subsides you do get a dark, brooding, mammoth Garnacha with prune, chocolate and baked power. A 15.5% heavyweight to drink before 2011.",Atteca Armas Old Vines,88,45,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Garnacha,Bodegas Ateca
61396,Spain,"Alluring bubby, regardless of origin or composition. The bouquet is dry, clean and spicy, with crushed raspberry. Full in the mouth, with a perfect texture; the peach and nectarine flavors are delicious. Finishes a bit racy and citrusy, with pink grapefruit and passion fruit. Outstanding rosado cava. Imported by Jorge Ordoñez Selections.",Rosé Brut Reserva,91,25,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Llopart
61474,Spain,"Seems a touch green and stripped at first, but airing brings it around. Still, there's a lot of fresh wood and resin, which somewhat masks the plum and berry fruit that's eager to emerge. Spicy on the finish, with a decent feel.",NA,86,19,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Red Blend,Clos Dels Coduls
61482,Spain,"Meaty on the nose, with chunky leather aromas along with mature fruit. In the mouth, it's a touch racy and acidic, which serves to bolster its raspberry and pie-cherry personality. Pretty good overall, with a sizable allotment of zest.",Reserva,86,47,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Altanza
61485,Spain,"Lean on the bouquet; there's almost zero yeast or lees character. But there is an interesting smoked-meat aroma that conjures memories of sausage or ballpark franks. Aggressive in the mouth, with green herbs and paprika. An unusual cava with confusing characteristics.",Aniversario PA 84 Brut Nature,86,70,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Parxet
61486,Spain,"Quite aggressive and murky at first, with a gassy, heavy bouquet of leather, earth and cooked plums. A lot of dryness comes out on the palate, courtesy of starchy tannins and medium-weight red fruit. Finishes with grip, size and a heavy hand. For best results, give it as much time as you can.",Elite,86,55,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Prado Rey
61487,Spain,"Saucy and mildly seductive, with aromas of herbs, leather and exotic spices. In the mouth, however, things seem a touch rustic and burnt. The palate carries some serious zing and spice, but to call it smooth would be a stretch.",Gran Reserva,86,30,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Mayor
61495,Spain,"Fat and melony on the nose, with tons of pear, cantaloupe, almond and vanilla on the palate. Heavily oaked, especially on the finish, where wood resin is mostly what you get.",Vinya Gigi,86,29,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Chardonnay,Jean León
61498,Spain,"Riper and deeper than some in this class, but arguably overoaked and roasted, such that the finish tastes like burnt coffee and the bouquet smells of peeled tire rubber. In between look for plum, blackberry, cumin and black pepper.",Crianza,86,19,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Prado Rey
61499,Spain,"This basic RdD delivers a smooth, ripe nose with doses of forest, bacon, road tar and violets, and there's some plum and blackberry at the foundation. Juicy and raw on the tongue, with racy, slick blackberry fruit. Finishes broad and medicinal, likely a sign of the hot vintage.",NA,86,14,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Valdubón
61505,Spain,"This starts with a strong blast of black olives, leather and blackberry, followed by condensed fruit flavors and a tinge of black cherry. A nice wine with character, but for $80 it comes up short of thrilling.",Paredinas,88,80,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Estancia Piedra
61513,Spain,"All in all this is a perfectly good wine. But in this pricey class and category we get picky, and we're finding some reduced, raisiny aromas and a slightly flat, edgeless mouthfeel. However, we do like the wine's berry and plum core and its intensity; too bad it's not more evenly balanced.",Cerrado del Castillo,88,75,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Castillo de Cuzcurrita
61515,Spain,"Dense and fairly earthy, with a big coating of chocolate and char courtesy of full-force oak. The palate is dark and heavy with blackberry fruit, compact tannins and some burnt notes, while the finish is a little salty but long. Not stellar but showing a lot of qualities.",Estate Bottled,88,54,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Alma de Tobia
61520,Spain,"Rich and a bit syrupy on the nose, with pepper and black cherry notes that keep things moving along. The palate is deep and round, with broad tannins housing beefy dark-fruit flavors and reasonable depth. A stocky wine that's ready to drink now or over the next few years.",Gran Reserva,88,35,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Marqués de Cáceres
61560,Spain,"Opens with black fruit aromas, dry oak and spice. The palate shows an oaky creaminess, sticky tannins and solid berry fruit flavors that are matched and maybe even trumped by buttery oak. A little dry and drawing on the finish, but still a very nice RDD.",NA,88,25,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto Fino,Emilio Moro
61569,Spain,"A black wine with aromas of graphite, molten earth and black fruit. The palate is a pounder with strong tannins and blazing acidity, and that creates a mouthfeel with grating intensity and roasted black fruit flavors. Lively late, with herbal notes and a lasting tannic bite. At over 15% alcohol, there's a lot of fire and toughness, so hold for a few more years and hopefully the tannins will soften.",Reserva,88,25,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Prado Rey
61579,Spain,"Flowery and fresh, with a bit of talc and creaminess to the bouquet. A little soft in the mouth, but still wet and likable. Flavors of lemon-lime and celery are solid, while the finish is dry and peachy. Treixadura, Godello, Loureira and Albariño comprise the grape blend.",NA,88,18,Galicia,Ribeiro,NA,White Blend,Viña Mein
61583,Spain,"Tropical smelling, with green banana, minerality and firmness to the bouquet. The palate is clean and cleansing, which are two very different things, while the wine tastes of tangy citrus and green melon. Fresh, tropical and uncomplicated. Drink this year.",NA,88,14,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Lícia
61629,Spain,"This smooth, stylish wine is on the way up, as evidenced by the two-point bump it's receiving from its last review, in December 2004. Today it's round and full, with aromas of hay and popcorn that draw you in. Layered through the middle, with expressive white fruit, dryness and sweetness all in one. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",Brut Reserva Privada,90,15,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Marques de Monistrol
61721,Spain,"Bulky and ripe, with raspberry and punch-like aromas. If you like sweet notes like kirsch, sugar beets and coulis, this has it. Clearly the wine reflects the hot vintage, so it's soft, chewy and bent on sweetness. Good, but not an ager.",Tinto,86,9,Catalonia,Catalonia,NA,Red Blend,Mas Marçal
61723,Spain,"A bulky, fruity style of cava that begins with aromas of floor polish, fruit essence and roasted corn. Shows much more citrus in the mouth, where the flavors run toward orange juice, lime and tarragon. Crisp and apple-based late, but never exciting enough to stir fandom.",Extremarium,86,16,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Mont Marçal
61726,Spain,"Typically amber in color, with aromas of dried cherries merging into apricots. Tangy and sharp on the palate, as is standard. Neither fruity nor deep, even according to Tondonia's track record. Newcomers may not be impressed.",Viña Tondonia Reserva,86,39,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,R. Lopez de Heredia
61733,Spain,"Extracted and raw, but with enough rustic country charm to make it worth a go. Four major grapes were thrown together, yielding cherry, beet and tomato aromas. The palate is ripe and edgy, with red plum and herb flavors. A tight, basic wine with ample tannin and acid.",ADA,86,10,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Finca Zubastía
61734,Spain,"Shows hickory-style wood aromas along with jerky, briar patch and cherry. Fairly fresh and forward, with a tangy palate dealing standard berry-cherry fare. Tight on the finish, with chocolate, pepper and coffee notes. A cut above the mass-market products; quite acceptable for the price",Roble,86,13,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,Blasón de San Juan
61802,Spain,"Clean, pure and a touch slight, but fine in terms of minerality and zest. This is nice with lots of melon, lemon verbena and almond notes. It finishes very long and nutty, showing good acidity. Drink as soon as possible for best results.",NA,88,17,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Agnusdei
61808,Spain,"Molasses, saddle leather and black olive aromas add complexity and masculinity to the bouquet, while flavors of black cherry, roasted plum and vanilla fit correctly into the wine's meaty, firm style. With obvious oak and raw tannins, this wine is still kicking and should drink well for another three to five years.",Roble,88,28,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Estancia Piedra
61821,Spain,"Crisp, green and friendly, with aromas of celery and fairway grass. The palate also has some green to it, namely celery and edamame, but there's adequate melon and grapefruit to balance things off. The finish is dry and pithy, with a lasting flavor of pink grapefruit. Imported by USA Wine Imports, Inc.",NA,88,12,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Valdelapinta
61822,Spain,"Standard but nicely done. This is a solid representative of 2001, and it's showing nice, mature cherry flavors along with integrated tannins, vanilla and an easygoing plumpness. Drink now.",Reserva,88,19,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Rioja Vega
61831,Spain,"Minerality is a major player in this peachy white blend that throws off some salinity and pool water on the nose. The palate has a round balance to it, while the flavors of lemon-lime, pineapple and mango get it done. Fresh and melony on the finish.",Vendimia Oro,88,36,Galicia,Ribeiro,NA,White Blend,Bodegas Docampo
61832,Spain,"Colorful and fresh, with a bit of latex/Band-Aid on the nose to go with bacon, raspberry and oak-based maple aromas. The feel is stout and chewy, while flavors of cassis, cherry and chocolate work well together. An oaky customer but a good and tasty one. Drink now and over the next two years.",Old Vines Reserva,88,17,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Navarro López
61836,Spain,"Slightly earthy and herbal, as Somontano reds are prone to be, with a gritty mouthfeel and sweet black fruit flavors that come with proper herbal accents. Tastes roasted and toasty, with pepper and heat on the lusty finish. Balanced and good; drink now through 2013.",Gran Vos Reserva,88,20,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Red Blend,Viñas del Vero
61845,Spain,"Clean, solid aromas of black cherry and berry are just what you want from Spanish Monastrell, and while this isn't the most unique or original wine, it sure is tasty, balanced and pleasing. Flavors of lightly baked black fruits are lush, while the finish is medium-long and easygoing. Hard to find anything wrong with this affordable red from Alicante.",La Tremenda,88,11,Levante,Alicante,NA,Monastrell,Enrique Mendoza
61855,Spain,"From Freixenet, this is perfectly good yet familiar, which for $15 is about as good as we can expect. The palate is juicy and also smooth, with red berry, tomato and herbal flavors. There's good depth and balance throughout, and the finish rounds into form and closes things out in a tasty, subdued fashion.",Crianza,88,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Vaza
61875,Spain,"Perfectly approachable and wholesome. Aromas of bread dough, pear and lemon-lime are alert and attractive. The palate provides a lush bowl of kiwi, apple and pear, while some citrus coats the finish. Imported by European Cellars.",Imperial Gran Reserva,90,48,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Gramona
61987,Spain,"Exhibits dry red fruits and mushroom on the nose, with accents of forest and spice. Somewhat minty and forward on the palate, and arguably a touch gritty and sweet. Raw as it might be, no one can say this wine doesn't have guts. Imported by The Marchetti Co.",NA,85,6,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Crucillon
62001,Spain,"Not a bad little quaffer. From Martinez-Bujanda, this colorful, ripe red is solid and chunky, with sweet aromas of berries and black plum. It is what you would call straightforward, with little to no complexity but lots of girth. Finishes full, almost creamy.",NA,85,10,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,Finca Antigua
62006,Spain,"More heavy and ripe than expected, with a creamy, almost lactic nose. Round on the palate, with plum and black-cherry fruit. Good acidity and overall balance keep it afloat. Finishes with coffee, chocolate and spice. Not a world beater but good.",Hombros,85,22,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Casar de Burbia
62007,Spain,"From Bodegas Bretón, this medium-weight red is a touch stewy, with peanut and black-olive aromas along with red licorice and Tootsie Roll. The palate offers strawberry and red cherry, while the finish is surprisingly tangy, with a shock of overt acidity.",Crianza,85,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Loriñon
62053,Spain,"Bright apple, pear and pineapple aromas are indicative of the sharp white fruits this wine has to offer. The flavors of apple, pear and lime are refreshing, and like any Txakoli it hits with quick jabs and a lot of zest. Drink now.",NA,88,20,Northern Spain,Bizkaiko Txakolina,NA,Hondarrabi Zuri,Itsas Mendi
62077,Spain,"Dark berry, spice cake, savory leather and roasted meat aromas give this a deep, brooding, heavy exterior. The mouth has acceptable acidic kick for Toro, while the flavors are saucy and meaty, with licorice and earth notes. Not overly fruity or lively; it's more meaty and thick.",NA,87,19,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Finca Sobreño
62082,Spain,"The nose of red fruits comes with oak, mocha and toast, while the palate is crisp and tight, with juicy, dry red berry flavors and backgroud notes of chocolate and spice. Seems like an Old World throwback due to its leaner body and an emphasis on dry spice and acid-driven red fruit.",Cosme Palacio,87,18,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Palacio
62086,Spain,"More tan in color than the usual light yellow, with true aromas of flower blossoms, lemon and tropical fruits. The acidity is a bit pronounced and scouring, but that only means that the citrus and green apple flavors cut and cleanse. Juicy but modest when it comes to depth of flavor. Drink now.",NA,87,20,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Valmiñor
62096,Spain,"A bit rubbery and earthy, with compost, smoky bacon and black fruit aromas. Nicely balanced with a good mouthfeel, and showing solid berry and plum flavors. Peppery on the finish, with some roasted overtones. Perfectly good for a tough vintage.",NA,87,28,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Alonso del Yerro
62221,Spain,"Light as if it were even older than it is, but nicely perfumed and mild in scope. The nose is mature and woodsy, while the palate is light, acidic and still dancing with plum and cherry. Best if you don't expect too much from it.",Crianza,85,16,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Zitua
62223,Spain,"A bit sweet on the nose, with notes of caramel, blackberry and earth. Better at first, where it comes on ripe. But then it turns a little sluggish and heavy as it opens. Still, it's largely a good Rioja, maybe more in the “modern” style than old-school.",Reserva,85,24,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Origin
62230,Spain,"Rich and creamy, but lacks zest and drive. The nose and palate offer sweet banana and oak, while the feel is almost too pillowy. Tastes more like a dessert than a dry white should. Still, it's neither bad nor poorly made.",Fermentado en Barrica de Roble,85,NA,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Chardonnay,Enate
62238,Spain,"More minty oak than fruit on the nose, with simple but clean candied fruit flavors. A bit short on depth and complexity, but totally drinkable, especially after some airing. Decent texture to the finish, with leftover spice and wood-based flavors.",Hoya De Cadenas Reserva Prevada,85,11,Levante,Utiel-Requena,NA,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Vicente Gandia
62241,Spain,"Starts with appropriate earth, cherry and vanilla notes, which are followed by spicy cherry, cranberry and raspberry flavors. Shows red fruit in a more traditional style, while the finish is warm, a bit oaky, and ultimately quite fresh.",Crianza,85,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Montecillo
62248,Spain,"Lean and woody, with mint, herbs and sawdust on the nose. The palate is surprisingly saturated and healthy, with pepper and vanilla running side by side with dry cherry and raspberry. A bit scouring and tannic.",Crianza,85,14,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,Torres de Anguix
62296,Spain,"Light and limpid, with mild almond, palm butter and citrus aromas. This is a basic, clean wine that offers citrus, pineapple and mango flavors. It's a bit sweet and monotone in its delivery, but it doesn't offend and it goes down easy if properly chilled. Imported by Martín Códax USA.",NA,87,15,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Martín Códax
62309,Spain,"Earth, leather and mildly stewed aromas greet you, and right away one can tell this wine came from a warm vintage. It has integrity and depth but maybe it still couldn't escape what 2003 threw at it. Why do we say that? The acidity seems higher than normal, maybe because of early picking, and it lacks the pure-pleasure quotient that we look for in higher-priced Bierzo wines.",Daniel,87,50,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Luna Beberide
62313,Spain,"For a value-priced wine this scores well. The nose offers a nice mix of earth, warmth and berry fruit, while the palate is juicy, fresh and tastes of zesty berry. Composed on the finish, which is also fresh and lively. Perfect for by-the-glass or casual consumption.",NA,87,8,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Maximo
62314,Spain,"Chiseled aromas of lemon-lime and spring flowers are lean but clean, and that pretty much describes this blend of Treixadura, Torrontés and Palomino. Lime and green banana are the key flavors, and the finish brings back lemon-lime and minerality. More basic than flashy, but nice in a neutral way.",NA,87,10,Galicia,Ribeiro,NA,White Blend,Pazo Ribeiro
62319,Spain,"The packaging and name are a little contrived, but what's in the bottle stands up to scrutiny. The aromas are warm and plummy, with a hint of toast and cream. The palate is clean and juicy, with snappy black raspberry fruit and a fruity carry-over onto the finish. Spunky, fresh and pleasant.",NA,87,12,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,"Vivir, Vivir"
62320,Spain,"The sweet, rubbery nose deals earth, herbs, smoked meat and richness, while the palate is candied and big, with sweet, medicinal flavors of blackberry and black cherry. A touch lactic on the finish, but otherwise the wine is alert and ready to drink.",Clássic,87,16,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Onix
62326,Spain,"Mildly pickled and stemmy at first, with earthy compost aromas that fade and are replaced by raspberry and other berry fruit scents. The palate has snap and smacking tannins, with flavors of raspberry, cherry and a staunch buttery dryness. Brambly but with enough good fruit and body to make the cut.",Reserva,87,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,El Circulo
62332,Spain,"A clean, easygoing style of Albariño with salinic aromas along with apple and peach. The palate has a perfectly good feel to it, while the flavors of citrus and peach are a little plump and sweet. Finishes with tropical notes and pithy white grapefruit.",NA,87,20,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Paco & Lola
62335,Spain,"A mature, more traditional Spanish wine that's ready to drink. The nose mixes tomato leaf, mint and maturing berry aromas, while the starchy, grabby palate shows aging raspberry and strawberry fruit with ample leather and dryness. Caramel, vanilla and toast notes grace the finish.",Reserva,87,11,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Albali
62339,Spain,"Roasted berry, marzipan, prune, spice and earth are rolled into a solid whole on the bouquet, while the palate rides on the heavy side with grating tannins and deep but clumsy flavors of blackberry, raisin and fruitcake. Smooth but not complex or demanding. Chewy and bulky, which isn't uncommon for Toro.",Vendimia Seleccionada,87,20,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Puertas Novas
62385,Spain,"More open than many, with lemon-lime aromas that work as a nice entry. Full in the mouth, where mixed fruits mesh together. The back palate offers drier citrus on top of a smooth, creamy body. Finishing notes of green herbs and lettuce are welcome. Imported by Jorge Ordoñez Selections.",Brut Exclusive Reserva,89,12,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Marqués de Gelida
62395,Spain,"Regal in presentation, with its faux-metal label and broad-based bottle. And in every edition it's one of Spain's more elegant, serious cavas. Look for slightly toasted, charcoal-based aromas backed by ripe apple and sweet citrus flavors. Very good feel and length. One of Spain's truly consistent high-end bubblies. Imported by Freixnet USA.",Brut Reserva Heredad,89,20,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
62465,Spain,"Toast, butterscotch and oxidized apple aromas precede a heavy, nearly overripe palate loaded down with sticky apple, nectarine and banana. Where it does well is in texture, which is correct and pleasant. Finishes long and heavy. A different breed.",Brut,85,11,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Torre Oria
62466,Spain,"Earthy and ripe, with jammy, borderline stewy fruit that carries a meaty edge. Fairly one-line in terms of complexity, but it stands on its feet and tastes pretty solid. With some rustic character, it'll do the job.",50th Aniversario Sangre de Toro,85,10,Catalonia,Catalonia,NA,Rhône-style Red Blend,Torres
62474,Spain,"If it seems dirty at first, time will reveal tobacco and leather aromas along with black plum and coffee. Seems more sour than you might expect, with pie cherry and rhubarb flavors. Really high-toned on the finish, where it teeters on the brink of sour. Not bad but not endearing.",Reserva,84,27,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,Blasón de San Juan
62475,Spain,"Tons of color but the nose is a bit soupy, with aromas of heavy oak, black fruit, tomato and herbs. A blend of 60% Garnacha and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon that's solid but shrill. Hits with extract and tannins, but the integration and flavors don't quite achieve the next level.",Tinto,84,20,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Red Blend,Care
62478,Spain,"Plump and a bit stewy, but the flavors manage to take over in a fairly positive way. Upon sipping you take in blackberry and prune, but also some murkiness. Not much in the midpalate, but decent around the edges.",Crianza,84,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Valcortes
62479,Spain,"Muddled to start, with chocolate and earth aromas along with heavy, seemingly chewable berry fruit. Big on the palate, with slightly overripe plum backed by overt vanilla and brown sugar. A three-grape mix of Prieto Pecudo, Mencía and Tempranillo.",Doce Meses,84,17,Northern Spain,Vino Tierra de León,NA,Red Blend,Villacezan
62503,Spain,"Hints of peanut and caramel vie with mineral and acacia blossom for center stage on the nose, while the palate deals nut skins, lime, kiwi and gooseberry. In the end, this is a tangy, streamlined wine that's refreshing. It has some style but it's mostly just racy and lean.",NA,87,15,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,As Laxas
62510,Spain,"This is a nice, traditionally styled Rioja. Delivers smooth, earthy, leathery aromas and then spicy dry fruit that's right out of Rioja 101. With good acidity, it's a very respectable table wine from a weak vintage.",Vendimia Seleccionada,87,28,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Heras Cordon
62527,Spain,"A recommended entry-level Ribera, with aromas of violets, minerals and oak. The palate has a standard, competent feel and balance along with flavors of gangly berry fruit and black cherry. Mocha and vanilla help sweeten and soften up the finish, but overall it's a regular, fresh type of wine.",Finca Resalso,87,15,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto Fino,Emilio Moro
62540,Spain,"Aromas of black fruits, light oak and violets are good but basic, and that pretty much defines the rest of the wine. Expect an easy flowing palate with candied, regular berry flavors in front of a light to medium finish. Nicely done and approachable.",Al Muvedre Tinto Joven,87,15,Levante,Alicante,NA,Monastrell,Telmo Rodríguez
62542,Spain,"A jammy, fruity, extracted Tempranillo with simple, candied berry aromas followed by a heavy, bulky palate that's packed with warm berry fruit. A rich, young, jumpy sweetie that's designed to make you happy.",Codice,87,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
62548,Spain,"Nice and prickly, with aromas of nettles, citrus and minerals. The palate is fresh and acidic, while the flavors of green apple, scallion, pineapple, lemon and grapefruit come together well. Clean and not overly acidic on the finish. Varietally speaking, this is on the money.",Azumbre Viñedos Centenarios,87,18,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Agricola Castellana
62549,Spain,"A full-bodied red blend from Montsant. The nose is big and smells of black cherry, licorice and herbal, foresty notes, while the palate is saturated and grabby at the edges, with herb-tinged, roasted-berry flavors. Snappy and cheek-starching on the finish; drink now through 2011.",Etim Selección,87,18,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Red Blend,Agricola Falset-Marca
62597,Spain,"Fairly big and yeasty, with earth and mushroom notes that offer complexity to the apple and pear aromas that dominate. Fruity enough, with hints of nutmeg and white pepper. Richly texured with a ton of body. Roundness is its calling card. Imported by Winebow.",Gran Brut,89,42,Catalonia,Cava,NA,White Blend,Juvé y Camps
62670,Spain,"Maybe Pinot Noir isn't meant to be in Catalonia. This has a burnt nose, with medicinal cherry and cranberry aromas and flavors. Starts sweet then goes a bit raspy. Unusual.",Brut Rosado,84,NA,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Pinot Noir,Codorníu
62678,Spain,"Heavy and high-voltage, with a strong whiff of green bean to the nose. Flavors of raisin, raspberry and green pepper combine to create a palate that has its high moments as well as its faults. Tight on the finish, with lots of tobacco and bell pepper.",Gran Reserva,84,25,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,LAN
62679,Spain,"A Monastrell with 10% Cabernet, and it is heavily minty and woody, with leaner than expected fruit and a whole lot of resin and vanilla setting things off. Decent structure and mouthfeel, and with plenty of oak. Not bad but nothing too exciting.",Unico,84,27,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Merum
62682,Spain,"Some heft and richness propel this bargain wine to a higher level. There are even some bacon, beef and leather aromas in addition to the plump fruit scents. Chewy and chunky, with flavors of black cherry and raspberry. Yet still tangy and refreshing enough to avoid being clumsy.",NA,84,7,Levante,Utiel-Requena,NA,Tempranillo,Vicente Gandia
62692,Spain,"Not too refined, but still pretty tasty. The palate offers chewy cherry and raspberry fruit, while the finish is spicy and zesty to the point that it creates a tingle. Somewhat sugary, but definitely an easy one to drink.",Crianza,84,10,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Red Blend,Finca Antigua
62697,Spain,"Nice in terms of texture, but a bit strange and hard to identify as far as aromas and flavors go. The nose tosses up Sherry and syrup notes, while the flavors run toward Granny Smith apples and lime. Shockingly, the finish is sweet. Confounding and hard to appreciate, but not a bad cava.",Brut,84,15,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Montsarra
62706,Spain,"A blend of 65% Merlot with 35% Tempranillo;  the nose offers olive, black plum and a touch of resiny young oak. Black fruit, coffee and juicy acidity work the palate, and then some medium tannins and grab come up late. Not that complex but entirely satisfying, and consistent with past vintages that offered very good value for money.",Solaz Merlot-Tempranillo,87,9,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Red Blend,Osborne
62714,Spain,"Serious and true-to-form Verdejo, with dry lime and green fruits on the nose and lots of green apple, apricot and citrus in the mouth.

62734,Spain,"Fresh as can be, with pure aromas of nectarine and cherry blossoms. The palate is light but refreshing and lithe, with semisweet, punchy flavors of orange, peach and pith. Finishes clean and light in the classic, subtle, utilitarian way that a good Rioja rosé should.",Rosado,87,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Rosé,El Coto
62736,Spain,"Warm, lightly baked aromas of berries and earth give this a common, likable bouquet, which is backed by a proper feeling palate and flavors of plum, mulberry, earth and herbs. Settles well on the finish, with good length and more than adequate purity.",Crianza,87,18,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Dios Ares
62741,Spain,"Fairly dense and slightly herbal on the nose, with balsamic notes, dried cheese and mature fruit aromas. This is still spunky and well composed in the mouth, with flavors of tobacco, earthy berry and toasty oak. Shows weight and grab on the finish. An honest, mature wine to drink now; it's not going to improve.",Care Bancales,87,30,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Garnacha-Cabernet,Bodegas Añadas
62742,Spain,"Nice on the nose, with berry aromas, ample richness and rubber. The powerful palate delivers big-time blackberry, toast, roasted plum, coffee and chocolate, while the finish is also chocolaty and stout in structure. Chunky but tasty. A good Jumilla wine consisting of 85% Monastrell and 15% Syrah.",Monastrell - Syrah,87,11,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Bodegas Murtia
62745,Spain,"A chunky, thick, earthy type of wine with syrupy, sweet berry flavors and a friendly palate that's tannic but not too much so.

62754,Spain,"A Priorat blend made in a softer, more simple style. The nose has plum, prune, licorice and rooty scents, which precedes a thick, sweet palate that has mild tannic grip and flavors of raisin, black plum and wild berry. Plump and broad, with good depth.",Isaral,87,46,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Prior Pons
62758,Spain,"Good for a mature wine but it does smell a bit flat and damp. That murkiness blows off somewhat, leaving a solid, aged Rioja wine with acidic zap and lightly baked berry, cherry, tomato and spice flavors. Mild on the finish. Drink now.",Gran Reserva,87,40,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Ramirez de la Piscina
62759,Spain,"Earthy smelling, with slightly murky baked berry aromas. The palate is juicy and snappy, with strawberry and raspberry flavors that carry a bit of richness.

62888,Spain,"On one hand it shows black cherry, plum and licorice. On the other there are green, lettuce-like aromas and flavors. Along the way is some tang on the palate, length to the herbal finish, and an adequate mouthfeel.",Cosecha de Familia Félix Martinez Reserva,84,45,Central Spain,Vinos de Madrid,NA,Red Blend,Vinos Jeromin
62889,Spain,"Black in color and saturated with plum, fruit cake and vanilla aromas. Big in the mouth but clumsy, with dense, thumping black cherry and blackberry flavors. In fact, everything about the wine is black, including the burnt, licorice-tinged finish. Ponderous in the long run.",Tinto,84,10,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,Torres de Anguix
62894,Spain,"A little heavier than ideal, with a touch of raisin along with candied black cherry on the bouquet. Better in the mouth, where it comes to life on the wings of good acids, modest tannins, and simple but proper berry fruit flavors.",Crianza,84,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas LAN
62897,Spain,"Starts somewhat cooked and stewy before finding a better, fresher, fruitier groove. Weighty and full, with bright colors and aggressive flavors. Plum, berry and cherry notes dominate. Persistent airing unveils additional ripeness and soft tannins.",Nerola,84,20,Catalonia,Catalonia,NA,Red Blend,Torres
62903,Spain,"Very sweet, with cherry cola and licorice nibs comprising the nose. It's nothing more than simple Garnacha, which means it's all about red fruit and sunshine. Not a fine wine, but good for those with a sweet tooth.",Tinto,84,7,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Grenache,Marqués de Reala
62906,Spain,"This co-op wine is almost a good deal, but ultimately it does not show enough depth or elegance to reach the next level. The nose is a touch stewy and lifeless, while the palate offers chewy raisin, plum and berry. Flat on the finish, with a syrupy feel.",NA,83,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Don Ramón
62911,Spain,"Round and smooth up front, with fairly pure berry aromas along with hints of leather, chocolate and warm earth. You are getting your money's worth with this  medium-rich, balanced, semicomplex wine. The feel is right, the tannins smooth but present, and the finish touched up by coffee and mocha.",NA,87,13,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Red Blend,Hermanos Lurton
62914,Spain,"Full to the tipping point, with sweet aromas of pears and peaches. Is it over done? Maybe a little, but in between the folds of very ripe fruit there's some mineral and citrus pith. Bottom line: the funky blue bottle catches your eye and the wine is fine. But the 2005 cost $15 and this one is going for $28. Can somebody please explain the drastic price hike?",NA,87,28,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Mar de Frades
62918,Spain,"The west-central plains of Spain get hot and that heat is evident in almost every Ribera del Guadiana wine I've tried. In this case, the prune, leather and dry earthy aromas are controlled and solid, as is the blackberry flavor that works the palate, which is full, tannic and offers pretty good feel.",Vega Esteban Crianza,87,17,Central Spain,Ribera del Guadiana,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Ventura De Vega
62919,Spain,"Salneval is the so-called baby Albariño from Condes de Albarei, and it's lively and complete. Aromas of honeydew and peach nectar are appropriate and welcoming, while the apple, orange and pineapple flavors are fresh and agile. A wine for salads and seafood.",Salneval,87,10,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Condes de Albarei
62930,Spain,"Basic and fresh, yet not very individual in its aromas or flavors. The nose is your standard mineral and snappy citrus, while the palate offers nice apple, lemon and grapefruit flavors. It's more of tangy, cleansing wine than anything deep or cerebral. Drink now with salads or grilled shrimp.",Fuente Elvira,87,14,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Pedro Escudero
62940,Spain,"A sweet, raisiny old-vines Garnacha with candied aromas and a fat, chunky body that houses soft, short black fruit and peppery flavors. Tastes like licorice candy on the finish, which brings some heat and burn as well. An interesting Grenache that is sweet but isn't over the top in terms of ripeness.",Secastilla,87,30,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Grenache,Viñas del Vero
62956,Spain,"Rusty in color, with initial aromas of smoke, dried leaves, herbs, tobacco and subtle berry. That all indicates that it's not overdone, and thus the tobacco, earth and dried fruit flavors are par for the course. Dry and leafy on the finish, which indicates that now is the time to get at it.",Real de Aragón Centenaria,86,18,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Garnacha,Pagos Familia Langa
62960,Spain,"Darker and earthier than most basic Garnachas, with aromas of compost, baked earth, crusty black fruits and leather. The palate has a nice, ripe, bodied feel, while flavors of blackberry and boysenberry bring just the slightest hint of herbal green. Toasty and solid on the finish.",Kickass,86,13,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Garnacha,El Burro
62965,Spain,"Definitely an herbal wine, with tomato, oregano, pizza sauce and savory aromas. The palate has good snap and verve to it, while the feel is on the lean side. Flavors of baked berry, earth, caramel and coffee ring true, and the dry, toffee-tinged finish is a nice ending. Ready to go now.",Reserva,86,12,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,NA,Tempranillo,Anciano
63000,Spain,"Round and fruity, with sweet, attractive aromas. The palate is a bit dark for cava, with plum and bitter chocolate flavors.

63002,Spain,"Open and floral, with acacia and orange blossom on the nose. The palate is full-bore citrus, dealing orange and pink grapefruit.

Imported by Classical Wines.",Extremarium Brut,88,18,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Mont Marçal
63011,Spain,"Crisp and clean, thus it qualifies as a perfect apéritif wine. Secure in its apple and slate aromas and flavors, with a firm but persistent bead that fosters a fine mouthfeel. Best with nuts, olives, chips and especially seafood.",Reserva Raventós Brut,88,14,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Codorníu
63025,Spain,"Nice and fresh, with defined, attractive apple and pear aromas. Dry and fruity in the mouth, with a tad of sweetness to the firm papaya, lime and apple flavors. Ripe and round enough, with balance. The total packagein cava. Imported by Classical Wines.",Reserva Brut,88,12,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Mont Marçal
63106,Spain,"Spicy and inviting on the nose, with no shortage of oak. The palate holds that spiciness as bramble and some tartness enter the fray. More of a ready-to-go food wine; it doesn't really have the depth or complexity to go further.",Crianza,86,25,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Abad Dom Bueno
63107,Spain,"The color and mouthfeel on this modern-styled, expensive Rioja are both very nice. On the palate, it's cushioned and healthy, with smooth tannins and proper acidity. But aromatically and flavorwise, the wine is green almost to the point of vegetal. And there's only so much tobacco leaf, bell pepper and rosemary that one should have to take. Imported by Monsieur Touton Selection, Ltd.",Edicion Limitada,86,45,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas LAN
63108,Spain,"The bouquet of cassis, liqueur and molasses would seem to portend a lush, deep, very ripe wine. But emblematic of the cool, wet 2002 harvest, this wine is crisp to the point of sharp, with oak coming up late and on the finish. Falls off with more time in the glass.",Conde de Valdemar Reserva,86,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Valdemar
63115,Spain,"Big and chunky, with mild aromatic hints of bell pepper and green tobacco mixed with plum and berry.

63116,Spain,"Some hot radiator dust and carrot juice aromas impact the nose, while the zesty palate features orange, cherry skin and other racy flavors. This is a classic Navarran rosé that starts out better than it finishes. Best to drink it right away and well chilled.",Viñedo No. 5 Rosé,86,14,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Garnacha,Señorío de Sarria
63129,Spain,"Opens with common berry fruit aromas as well as a medicinal, minty note. The palate has short length and definition along with bouncy medium-depth berry flavors.

Spunky and clean, with honest flavors.",Urban Ribera,86,14,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,O. Fournier
63138,Spain,"A solid but seemingly standard blend of Tempranillo, Syrah and Garnacha with berry and cherry aromas along with touches of mint and leather. The palate is woody, with spiced berry flavors and decent body and structure. Vanilla and then oak-based bitterness define the finish. A good wine but hardly a knockout.",Corpus del Muni Roble,86,20,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas del Muni
63139,Spain,"Tight and largely neutral white fruit aromas show a little apple but little more. The palate is friendly and easy, with melon as the lead flavor. Turns more citrusy and weighty on the finish, which fades fast.",Viña do Campo,86,18,Galicia,Ribeiro,NA,White Blend,Bodegas Docampo
63143,Spain,"One of the best $7 wines you'll find from Spain. The nose is bright, medicinal and floral, while the palate is loud and peppy, with sweet red fruit flavors that sport a candied coating.

63279,Spain,"Melon, honey and white stone-fruit aromas carry the nose, with a touch of sulfuric match stick sneaking in late.

A nice wine for near-term consumption.",NA,86,10,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Pazo Serantellos
63284,Spain,"The greeting is nothing but pure green coconut, and that essence of powerful, almost overpowering oak persists all the way through. Along the way, and amidst the resin and sawdust, the wine offers dark fruit, potency and flash. But the depth isn't here, thus the wood stands out.",Selección,86,46,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Torrederos
63297,Spain,"This granular, mildly earthy Toro falls into the everyday category, but within that market segment it'll do just fine with steaks, burgers and lamb chops. It offers viscosity, blackberry fruit and a long, chocolaty finish. It's not ultrarefined but it has plenty of stuffing and kick.",NA,86,15,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Tres Barcos
63301,Spain,"Full, roasted and earthy on the nose, with only some coconut and berry aromas to sweeten things up. Tight, level and structured in the mouth, with roasted raspberry and plum along with oaky, buttery, smoky accents that confirm the wine's “roble” designation. Good but with some excess oak to process.",NA,86,18,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Peña Roble
63304,Spain,"Floral, spicy, semi-oaky aromas precede a tangy, fresh, higher-acid palate with snappy raspberry and red cherry flavors. There's an abundance of pop and snap to this medium-bodied wine, and then drying woody notes to the finish.",Sentido,86,28,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Neo
63305,Spain,"Aromas of balsam wood, dry leather, and slightly herbal berry fruit are generally appealing, while the palate has size, balance and a healthy feel to it.

63317,Spain,"Aromas of fresh tomato, citrus peel and red fruits are a touch austere, but the mouth and flavors are more generous. The palate is well balanced and the flavors run sweet, ripe and chewy, with berry fruit and creamy licorice notes on the finish.

63329,Spain,"Opens with a blast of cola and minty grass, and then comes a raisiny wave and mossy herbal notes that are typical of Navarran Merlot, which makes up 60% of this three-grape blend.

63477,Spain,"A heavier, sweeter style with cider-like aromas followed by apple and lime flavors. In the mouth, this is a more citric wine that may go well with shellfish. It's sturdy and zesty, but not that evolved. Tasted twice, with this note reflecting the better of the two bottles.",Esencia Diviña,85,19,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Adegas Gran Vinum
63510,Spain,"Starts with a crusty, almost mineral top over oaky, chunky blackberry fruit. It's a standard, semiherbal, juicy red blend (75% Tempranillo) with flavors of dried cherry and mocha. Short on the finish, with a hint of vanilla and chocolate. Good overall.",Selección Especial,86,NA,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Abadia Retuerta
63518,Spain,"Light and dominated by red fruit from the nose to the palate to the finish. Along the way are edgy accents of spice, stem, citrus and dry oak. Among all the big bruisers out there today, this is more from the old school, meaning it's fresh, lithe and crisp.",Crianza,86,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Lealtanza
63521,Spain,"Starts with punchbowl aromas of berry fruit, flowery scents and candy. The palate has a good freshness to it along with snap and flavors of cherry, plum and berry. Nothing complicated here; just a juicy, fresh wine that's likable and not overpriced.",Monte Castrillo,86,14,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Finca Torremilanos
63523,Spain,"Opens with good berry fruit aromas, mineral notes and coconutty sweetness, which is followed by a plump, well-balanced palate of black fruits, plum and licorice. Finishes solid and warm, with enough vitality and juiciness to maintain balance. More or less what you want from affordable Monastrell.",Castillo de Jumilla,86,10,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Bodegas Bleda
63524,Spain,"On the plus side, there's a smoky, meaty set of aromas. But on the down side, there's a rubbery character reminiscent of burnt tire tread. That rubbery element passes through to the flavors, which also bring roasted berry into the fold. Rustic stuff with just enough bold berry fruit to make it worth a go.",Arderius Crianza Vendimia Seleccionada,86,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Leza García
63525,Spain,"Begins with muddled, murky, syrupy aromas of caramel and berries. The palate is more high-toned, with lemony accents to tomato, baked fruit and savory flavors. Finishes solid albeit lightly damp and bitter. Comes around with time but always seems a bit murky.",Glorioso Crianza,86,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Palacio
63526,Spain,"Roasted and mildly leafy, and then clacky and a bit tannic in the mouth. The fruit flavors are good and mostly pure as they settle on black cherry and blackberry, while the finish is jammy but short. For $8 this should not disappoint.",NA,86,8,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Capa
63528,Spain,"This new wine from the Torres group is a little heavy and baked on the nose, but once you get it onto the palate there's depth, mouthfeel and solid flavors of savory fruit, soy, rubber and dark berry. Dry on the finish, with a mounting note of coffee. Not overly fruity or sweet, which may be a blessing for some palates.",Infinite,86,10,Spain Other,Spain,NA,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Torres
63586,Spain,"Apple to start with, with some sweet doughiness to ease things along. Rather crisp and dry, which is all very classic. Flavors of white grapefruit and lemon are laser-like, while the finish is tight, almost sharp. Good quality; a little short. Made with Chardonnay and Parellada. Imported by North American Beverage Group.",Eric Brut Nature,87,22,Catalonia,Cava,NA,White Blend,Vallformosa
63598,Spain,"Classic and austere, with light toast and vanilla aromas in front of stark green apple and lime flavors.

Imported by Classical Wines.",Gran Reserva Brut Nature,87,25,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Huguet de Can Feixes
63640,Spain,"Typical of many 2002 Riojas, this packs a punch but doesn't hit many high marks. The nose is heavy and dark, while the plum and cherry flavors that carry the palate also have touches of green and bramble. Ample oak covers the wine and its weaknesses, and in Roda's skilled hands the wine isn't bad.",Roda Reserva,85,44,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Roda
63642,Spain,"The nose is floral and tropical, while the palate is clean, zesty and full of melon and papaya. For a basic, straight-ahead wine with no acidic curves or oaky bumps, this is commendable. Best if served well chilled, and in less serious settings.",NA,85,8,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Chardonnay,Coto de Hayas
63644,Spain,"With this Airen and Macabeo blend you'll get almondy aromas in front of apricot and peach flavors. It's a solid, fairly well-balanced wine that won't hurt your budget or your appetizers.",Protocolo Blanco,85,6,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,White Blend,Dominio de Eguren
63646,Spain,This is a nice little Viura (with 15% Chardonnay) that smells nutty and smooth and tastes of tangy citrus and other white stone fruits. It has more acidity than body and it locks onto that citrusy profile and doesn't let go. But overall it's a good quaff for the price.,NA,85,7,Central Spain,Tierra de Castilla,NA,Viura,Infinitus
63654,Spain,"Clean and fresh, and isn't that the first prerequisite for any decent rosé? The palate offers citrus and peppery apple skin flavors, while the finish is long and loud. Pretty good Garnacha that's ready for the summer and early fall. Drink now.",Rosado,85,8,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Coto de Hayas
63694,Spain,"Concentrated, willing aromas of black cherry and sweet plum are nice and friendly, while the palate is lively, juicy and a little tart for Garnacha, with an emphasis on red raspberry. The wine dries out a bit on the finish, leaving vanilla and spice. Good enough for a basic Aragonese red.",Corona d'Aragón,85,13,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Garnacha,Grandes Vinos y Viñedos
63704,Spain,"A pretty good Tempranillo-Garnacha blend with simple but fresh berry and plum aromas. The palate has snap but no overt acidic bite, while flavors of cherry and berry are slightly herbal and end with a mild buttery accent. A touch flimsy but keeps it together.",Old Vine,85,13,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Red Guitar
63714,Spain,"Standard black-cherry aromas carry a candied, vanilla-like twinge, while the feel is juicy and snappy. Flavors of sweet berries and cherry are just fine, and they come with a nod of spice and bitterness. Punchy and fresh overall, with good ripeness and balance.",NA,85,8,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Garnacha,Castillo de Monséran
63725,Spain,"Creamy and yeasty, with mild apple and bread-based aromas. Nice in the mouth, with citrus leading the way. Shows ample kick and acidity, with length and balance on the finish. Perfectly good overall, if not overly exciting. Imported by Bon Vivant Imports.",Brut Nature,87,20,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Castellroig
63733,Spain,"Different from the crowd. The nose concedes light raspberry and cranberry aromas, while the palate is a pink passion play that's not that easy to figure out. It's tangy, with citrus and berry mixing in an unconventional manner. Interesting in the mouth; a quality wine. Not run of the mill. Imported by De Maison Selections, Inc.",Rosado Brut Reserva,87,20,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Avinyó
63771,Spain,"Termanthia is the pinnacle of Tinta de Toro. Aromas of wild blackberry, crude oil, forest floor and truffles are just now showing themselves, while the tight, tannic palate is full of black plum, blackberry and bitter chocolate flavors. Espresso and roast meat notes grace the dark, jam-packed finish, and as a whole this is one bold, boisterous wine. Best in 2011 thru 2013. Only 531 cases.",Termanthia,95,200,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Numanthia
63810,Spain,"Round and sweet, with heavy buttercup and honeyed aromas. This is what we call a candied Albariño; it's loaded up with canned pineapple, melon and mango. The feel is plump and the acid level fairly low. Ripe and ready as it's ever going to be.",NA,85,13,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Lícia
63811,Spain,"While not that distinct, there's nothing wrong with this plump blend of 70% Verdejo and 30% Viura. The wine offers standard green melon and apple flavors, with sweet grapefruit notes on the finish. Better in the near-term; drink well chilled.",NA,85,13,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,White Blend,Hermanos Lurton
63812,Spain,"A touch saucy and soupy to start with, but airing sends it to a better place. This wine falls into the chunky and ripe category, with good but heavy black cherry and black plum flavors. All the way through it's a wide load, but generally speaking an appealing wine to drink now.",Hi.,85,11,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Garnacha,Hi Wines
63823,Spain,"Blackberry and raisin with a sharp smokiness carries the nose. The palate is not overly generous, but it does house berry, spice and vanilla flavors along with some clipped tannins. Has the components but not the harmony. Imported by Newton Land Development, Inc.",Encomienda Templaria Reserva,84,17,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Agribergidvm
63824,Spain,"Deep purple in color; this is a classic young grapeball across the bouquet, with sweet candied fruit aromas. The palate is plump and full of youthful blackberry flavors, while the finish is moderately chewy and substantive. Not a finesse-driven wine by any means; but good if you like simple, forward fruit character.",NA,84,7,Central Spain,Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Infinitus
63826,Spain,"Raisin, baking spices and other soft, cooked aromas set the stage for a dense palate that's easy but flabby. In between the folds there's molasses and raisin flavors backed by a soft, fading palate. It's a sweet and inoffensive wine, but one with little future.",Oscar Tobía,84,35,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Tobía
63837,Spain,"Dry and piercing on the nose, and then crisp and snappy on the palate. For those opposed to overextracted, heavy reds, this could be up your alley. More modern-influenced palates will probably find it a bit lean, stripped down and tart, especially for Toro, which is known for bigger, riper wines.",Cosecha,84,9,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Caño
63879,Spain,"Punchy berry aromas are floral and jumpy, and the palate is more sheering and tart than expected, but still fresh and clean.

Could use more flavor and depth along with less acidic bite.",Hito,85,20,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto Fino,Cepa 21
63881,Spain,"A better wine than the label's varietal Garnacha, so it seems as though the Tempranillo brings character and elevation. Wild berry and cherry aromas mix in citrus and spice, while the palate is fruity, with pepper and soft spice flavors. Turns a touch tart and toward cranberry the longer it's open.",Rojo Granrojo,85,9,Central Spain,Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Bodegas Navarro López
63884,Spain,"A little bit dark and crusty on the bouquet, with murky, earthy black cherry aromas that get clearer and cleaner with air. Briary plum and cherry flavors are solid if nothing else, and the finish is basically more of the same, with length. A competent wine, but that's where it ends.",NA,85,12,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,Finca Antigua
63894,Spain,"Dusty, lightly oaked berry aromas are entirely regular, while the berry driven palate is dry, drawing and oaky, with pretty good body but stand-out acidity as well. Tastes a bit woody and peppery late. A highly generic wine that makes you wonder why it costs $30.",Tríptico,85,30,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo-Shiraz,Storks' Tower
63928,Spain,"Light and lean, with lively fruit aromas and flavors. Freshness is what this wine pushes, because there's not much weight or overt sweetness to it. Light apple, a touch of pear, and some lemon-lime is the most that you're going to get. Still, it works as a palate freshener. Imported by Jorge Ordoñez Selections.",Leopardi Brut Nature,87,18,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Llopart
63956,Spain,"Dense and dark, with huge black-fruit aromas, toasty oak, chocolate and balsamic notes. Numanthia is ripe, rugged and intense, with in-your-face black fruit, coffee and burnt-toast accents. The feel and finish are deep as a cool well, and smooth as a whistle. Masculine to the max, and pretty close to being ready to drink. Best to hold until the fall or winter. 12,000 cases made.",Numanthia,93,60,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Numanthia
63991,Spain,"Functional Rioja Reserva is what this is. The nose starts out smoky and powerful, but the fruit is lean and on the snappy and tart side, with orange peel and cherry skins getting into the game.

64003,Spain,"Bierzo in northwest Spain is best known for the red Mencía grape, but here we find organic Godello with hay, corn and other slightly overripe aromas. To continue on the theme, the palate is a touch baked and soft, with spongy melon and papaya flavors. A pliable wine that may already be past its prime. Imported by Newton Land Development, Inc.",Fructus Odorus,84,10,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Godello,Agribergidvm
64023,Spain,"Super dense and hard as a rock, with bacon and black fruit aromas that lead straight to a saturated, chewy, tannic palate that pounds away as it delivers blackberry, coffee, licorice and other huge flavors. As big, baked and heavy as they come, with gargantuan tannins. Includes 15% Syrah in addition to Monastrell.",Cármine,85,30,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Bodegas Murtia
64044,Spain,"Smells sort of gummy and candied, with aromas of red licorice stick, raisin and raspberry jam.

Burns a little on the finish due to sharp acids.",Cantos de Valpiedra,85,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Finca Valpiedra
64047,Spain,"Lightly stemmy and brambly, with lean red fruit aromas, a touch of saline and red licorice candy.

Tight on the finish; similar is some ways to a simple Chianti.",Crianza,85,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Rioja Vega
64049,Spain,"This is the prototype for an over-the-top, roasted, charred Tempranillo. The nose smells directly of burnt coffee, charcoal and grilled beef. It's super-chunky on the tongue, with dominating roasted black fruit flavors. It has its merits but is still too blackened for our liking.",NA,85,20,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo,Tritón
64096,Spain,"Cherry and dusty cinnamon aromas blend with a touch of cough drop on the nose, while the full-bodied palate pits spicy berry and plum against rather soft acidity.

64132,Spain,"Dark, rubbery and focused on the nose, while the palate is wider, richer and propped up by a band of zesty acidity. The flavors are typical of Toro, meaning dark blackberry and boysenberry. A finish of brandied berries, kirsch and chocolate is almost like dessert.",Termes,92,30,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Numanthia
64134,Spain,"Astrales has really nailed it the past couple of years, and while the '06 isn't quite as good as 2005, it's still an excellent wine. Blackberry, tobacco and cocoa aromas lead into a stacked flavor profile of boysenberry and plum. And on the finish it expands and brings vanilla and fudge into play. Drink now and over the next six years.",NA,92,67,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Astrales
64166,Spain,"Lush and full-bodied, this Tempranillo from vines more than 65 years of age handles its size gracefully, with precise flavors of blackberries and peppery spice rounded out by hints of vanilla and tobacco.",Selección Especial,89,40,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Montebaco
64175,Spain,"Nothing earth-shattering here, but this Garnacha is sweet and syrupy, with jammy berry and black plum flavors. It's totally round and soft, with no hard tannins or confounding complexities. It's a sound, uneventful red wine.",NA,84,10,Central Spain,Tierra de Castilla,NA,Garnacha,Tapeña
64181,Spain,"A little too much canned fruit cocktail and grapefruit juice on the nose, but overall it's generous with its sweetness. The palate offers ripe nectarine, although the feel runs perilously close to being cloying. Better if you don't mind some stickiness to your white wines.",NA,83,13,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Godello,Abad Dom Bueno
64183,Spain,"Dark and resiny, with aromas of leather, black olive and jammy berries. The palate runs quite sweet and without the backbone needed to prop things up. Hence the mouthfeel is lacking and the finish peters out quickly. Tasty enough, but short on feel and structure.",NA,83,10,Central Spain,Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Tapeña
64189,Spain,"Frankly this is nothing to swoon over. The color is salmon and the nose is like matchstick sulfur. The wine is surprisingly sweet for being 80% Tempranillo and 20% Garnacha, and it's borderline cloying on the finish. Has its moments but I'm not really sure what the point is.",Cune Rosado,83,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Rosé,CVNE
64190,Spain,"Gold in color, with papaya, almond and orange on the nose. The palate features a heavy mix of citrus and apples, and in the end it's a style that leaves you questioning its intention. It's dense and wet, but also reduced and clumsy.",El Cerezo,83,10,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Chardonnay,Castillo de Monjardin
64193,Spain,"Noticeably sharp and a touch green on the nose, with earthy, richer accents such as leather and chocolate making an appearance. The mouth is tangy and lean, with strawberry and raspberry flavors. Very un-Toro in its skinny, tight approach.",Selección,83,15,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tempranillo,Caño
64194,Spain,"Spice and warm leather on the nose are worthy aromas, but there isn't much fruit and the palate runs gritty and acidic. It's got freshness and fairly good purity; but it's also kind of narrow.",Vega Esteban Crianza,83,10,Central Spain,Ribera del Guadiana,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Ventura De Vega
64203,Spain,"Uncomplicated and dominated by red fruit aromas and flavors. This is your everyday type of red wine that could probably be made from just about any grape or blend of grapes. Here, Tempranillo and 15% Shiraz make for a dry, mildly oaky red with freshness and little else. Fine if you're not looking for anything special.",NA,85,10,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo-Shiraz,Penascal
64206,Spain,"Opens with peppery, earthy black cherry and berry aromas, yet the palate is clacky and narrow, with high acidity and dry, limited flavors of blackberry and black cherry. Narrow as well on the finish. Middle-of-the road and respectable but hardly a head-turner.",Senda del Oro,85,18,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Vizcarra
64207,Spain,"A little herbal and minty on the nose, but at this price one can't complain too mightily. The palate smacks down with bite and acidity, while the flavors run herbal and a little stemmy, with caramel as a backdrop. Roasted and herbal but not offensive, especially at $7 a bottle.",Tintico,84,7,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo,Castillo de Monjardin
64208,Spain,"Heavy, minty and smelling of shoe polish, barrel char and black licorice. The palate is chunky but overall it has pretty good structure. Meanwhile, the flavors of raspberry and plum carry a heavy oak influence. Spice and resin, additional reflections of the oak, dominate the finish.",Selección,84,17,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Cueto
64216,Spain,"Rather barnyardy and gaseous at first, but air breathes more clarity into the nose. The palate is chunky, grabby and a little awkward, with herbal, medicinal black fruit and buttery flavors. Slight heat and burn hamper the finish.",Misterio de...,84,12,Central Spain,Uclés,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Fontana
64217,Spain,"Big and bold stuff from southern Spain with burnt, hot aromas of roasted black fruits and stems. Better on the palate, where it brings plum and berry flavors but also some heat and saline. Slightly stemmy and roasted on the finish, much like the bouquet.",Taja,84,9,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Bodegas Mähler-Besse
64261,Spain,"Yellow in color and heavy on the nose. Toast is the lead aroma, and with that there's some caramel and peanut butter. Dry and lean in the mouth, with lemon and grapefruit notes. Still, it has class and style to it; not a dullard. Fairly unique. Imported by CIV/USA.",Brut Nature,87,15,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Cristalino
64290,Spain,"The Evo '05 is composed, lively and impressive. The tobacco, coffee, leather and balsamic fruit aromas are lovely, while the berry, plum, herb, chocolate and tobacco flavors are integrated and graceful. Drink now through 2012.",EVO,92,30,Northern Spain,Ribera del Queiles,NA,Cabernet Blend,Guelbenzu
64320,Spain,"Don't expect a lot from this fruity but fading blend of Treixadura and Albariño. It offers heavy green plum and melon flavors, yet it's losing steam as it turns heavy and briny.",NA,83,17,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,White Blend,Pazo Viladomar
64331,Spain,"Sharp and sweaty on the nose, with bulky passion fruit, scallion and citrus flavors. This wine is on its last legs; it's soft, fleshy and starting to lose its final vestiges of freshness. You'll be better off waiting for the 2006, assuming it gets to market soon.",NA,83,22,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Don Olegario
64335,Spain,"Rubbery and not all that convincing on the nose. The palate is sizable but also acidic, which leads to a tart, almost sour flavor profile that is dominated by tangy cherry skins and citrus zest. Imported by Newton Land Development, Inc.",Castro Bergidum Roble,82,9,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Agribergidvm
64337,Spain,"Strange that a 2006 wine will already seem old, but thus is the bane of Somontano, a region striving for better wines but not always hitting the target. This Macabeo-Chardonnay blend goes heavy on the melon and apple character, and in the end it teeters on cider-like.",Montesierra Chardonnay-Macabeo,82,9,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,White Blend,Bodegas Pirineos
64350,Spain,"Dark and chunky, but also salinic and clammy smelling, with black fruit aromas sitting in front of a palate of salinic, woody, baked fruit flavors. The tannic finish is hard and edgy, and there's some heat too. Has its high and low points.",Dos,84,15,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Bodegas Murtia
64352,Spain,"Harder and more oily on the nose than desired, with white-fruit aromas that turn sharp. The palate has ample wetness and acidity, but the flavors are somewhat bitter, nutty and oily. It's also mildly bitter on the finish. Something's not quite right here, yet it doesn't seem flawed.",Zios de Lusco,84,19,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Lusco
64353,Spain,"Light to medium aromas of cherry and berry are fresh and snappy, while the palate has high acidity, light extract and crisp, almost lean flavors of cherry and red plum. A pointed but clean wine that will do well with simple foods like sliced ham or salami.",NA,84,9,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Garnacha,Manyana
64363,Spain,"A touch green smelling, with aromas of coffee grinds and earth. Tannic in the mouth, and then hollow in the middle, with green-leaning, leafy flavors of blackberry and cola. Roasted on the finish, with burnt coffee and chewy, bitter tannins.",Tinto Joven,84,13,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Abadía la Arroyada
64368,Spain,"Rubber and plum aromas are accented by cinnamon spice notes on this fuller-sized, somewhat sticky but basic Garnacha. Dark in color and slightly herbal in terms of flavors, with tart cherry and a slightly dilute feel to the finish. Basic but honest.",NA,84,9,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Garnacha,Legado Muñoz
64375,Spain,"Basa has long been one of our go-to whites from Rueda, but this vintage seems to be on the slide. The nose is oily and short, while the fruit is turning toward bitter. It still has some vitality and green fruit character, but our advice is to wait for the 2009. A blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Verdejo.",Basa,84,15,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,White Blend,Telmo Rodríguez
64376,Spain,"Light berry aromas carry a citrusy edge, while the crisp palate is lean but clean, with dry, peppery plum and cherry flavors. There's not too much body or complexity here; it's juicy, a little metallic and highly regular. 60% Tempranillo and 40% Garnacha.",NA,84,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Tempra Tantrum
64377,Spain,"Jammy smelling, with raisin and cough drop aromas. The palate maintains that jammy profile, while the flavors run creamy and short, with a lean toward strawberry and raspberry. A little grassy and green on the finish, with a final dose of candy.",Joven,84,12,Levante,Yecla,NA,Red Blend,Valle de Salinas
64453,Spain,"The nose is all dense blackberries, while the palate is deep, flashy and ripe, with flavors of black cherry and blackberry. If you like big, bold wines, then this one should strike you in a good way; it's saturated and dark, with a touch of vanilla and mocha on the finish. Great balance for such a big wine. Drink now through 2012.",Élite,91,36,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Muruve
64481,Spain,"A blend of 55% Tempranillo, 20% Cabernet, 20% Merlot and Syrah. But in the end it comes up a bit barnyardy and bretty, with animal aromas giving way to a racy, almost lemony palate that also offers some wild raspberry. For $35 it's scattered and faulty.",6 meses en barrica,82,35,Central Spain,Tierra de Castilla,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Aresan
64482,Spain,"Peppery raisin is the dominant aroma on this condensed, sun-baked wine that surprisingly shows spiky acidity and a rugged mouthfeel. Seems like the winery was shooting for a riper, bigger style than its regular Vega Esteban crianza, and that heft and kick don't really help.",Leyendas de Vega Esteban Crianza,82,20,Central Spain,Ribera del Guadiana,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Ventura De Vega
64484,Spain,"A strong whiff of wintergreen cements the wine's herbal status; it seems as though the grapes were likely picked to beat the heat but maybe weren't fully ripe. Hence the wine shows lean strawberry and raspberry characteristics, and always there's that shot of green.",Crianza,82,11,Central Spain,Ribera del Guadiana,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Canchal
64485,Spain,"Peppery and tough smelling, with tomato-leaf aromas. This is a bland, innocuous wine with a touch of berry sweetness on the midpalate but no complexity or follow through.",Rojo Granrojo,81,9,Central Spain,Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Bodegas Navarro López
64487,Spain,"A native Basque white that's way past its prime. Txakoli wines barely last a year and need to be attacked very young, and this '05 is pretty much DOA. It still has some character and perfume, but it's getting heavier and duller by the minute. Look for the 2006 or wait until the spring/summer for the 2007.",NA,81,19,Northern Spain,Getariako Txakolina,NA,White Blend,Txomín Etxaníz
64488,Spain,"Lemon peel and citrus aromas are the proper foreshadowing of what's to come: a tart, lean, old-style wine that is ultimately lean and grabby. These days you have to give the consumer more richness and flavor than this.",Crianza,81,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marqués de la Concordia
64489,Spain,"Burning hay field, roasted corn and other over-the-hill aromas put this one on life support. The palate isn't much livelier; there's dry, bland citrus and more canned corn. Not a total mess but not very fresh or attractive.",Viña Reboreda,81,9,Galicia,Ribeiro,NA,White Blend,Bodegas Campante
64490,Spain,"Macabeo, Gewürz and Chardonnay all in one...and what's the point? The wine tastes of apricots and other chunky fruits. Basically it's unfamiliar stuff that doesn't strike a chord despite the fact that it seems reasonably well made.",Mesache Blanco,81,11,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,White Blend,Bodegas Pirineos
64495,Spain,"The number of good, even palatable, varietally bottled Gracianos is small. This is typical of what you usually find: lean flavors, spiky acidity and even a chemical burn to the nose.",Viñedo No. 7,81,15,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Graciano,Señorío de Sarria
64497,Spain,"A wine in discord. The nose shows raisiny P.X. Sherry hints, while the palate is underdeveloped and tart. Shallow and almost too sour.",Leyendas de Vega Esteban Crianza,80,12,Central Spain,Ribera del Guadiana,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Ventura De Vega
64499,Spain,"Acceptable, but barely. There's a strange citric, grassy tinge to the nose that makes it smell like Verdejo or Sauvignon Blanc. And it tastes pickled and briny. Decent mouthfeel and sensory balance save it from even lower depths.",T-Sanzo Rosado,80,10,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo,Valsanzo
64519,Spain,"Shows yeasty, earthy, dusty aromas, with just a slight trace of fruit. There are also mild fruity flavors. It's slightly sweet as a semi-seco should be, but has adequate acidity and decent length finishing with some richness.",Semi Seco Reserva,86,9,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Champagne Blend,Jaume Serra
64537,Spain,"A bit strange smelling for Rioja in that the nose deals a mix of candied berry aromas along with stemmy, herbal, compost notes. The palate is thick and chewy, while the flavor profile includes lightly baked, creamy berry and roasted accents. Stocky and fruity but with issues.",Cortijo III Tinto,84,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Cortijo
64551,Spain,"Starts out with gassy, earthy aromas that suggest heat and barnyard, while the palate is chunky and full, with stemmy black cherry, plum and berry flavors along with coffee and chocolate accents. Delivers power and length but not much in the way of character or complexity.",Auroch,84,12,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Tribal
64554,Spain,"A mix of standard berry fruit and leafy, herbal qualities is the starting point. Next up is a tangy, acidic palate of red fruits, vanilla, acidity and ultimately some bitterness. Short and gritty on the finish. Tastes and smells like mass-market Bordeaux. A blend of 60% Tempranillo and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Rívola,84,15,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Abadia Retuerta
64579,Spain,"Light and lemony, with a hint of green astringency. Tangerine with hints of mushroom on the palate run toward a solid but lean finish. Has zest but little roundness. Fresh and crisp, but not the most friendly bubbly.",Brut Nature Reserva de la Familia,86,22,Catalonia,Cava,NA,White Blend,Juvé y Camps
64583,Spain,"Not every wine is easy to read: this one is a case in point. The nose offers sweet toffee and apricot, while the palate starts out toasty and dry before unveiling ripe peach and brown sugar. The dosage on this wine is unusual. A funky bubbly that's worth a try.",Cuvée Dessert Dulce,86,20,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Pinot Noir,Parxet
64601,Spain,"Over a year ago this wine rated only 86, but bottle age has improved it, and now its condensed nose of black fruit and chocolate mint chip is very pleasing. The palate is ripe and offers blackberry and cured meat, while the finish delivers licorice, pepper and a touch of salami. Proof that wines do change over time, and that sometimes we underrate the youngsters.",NA,91,57,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Red Blend,Pago de Larrainzar
64609,Spain,"A forward wine with earthy aromas, leather and a hint of Navarra's herbal essence. The palate is full-bodied and complete, with balanced weight and tannic structure. Flavors of dark berry and black plum are deep and mildly roasted, while the finish is meaty and chocolaty. Chivite Colección 125 is often Navarra's best red wine, and that appears to be the case in 2004.",Colección 125 Reserva,91,45,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Julián Chivite
64612,Spain,"The excellent 2005 Azul is stout and secure, with a ripe, clean and modern bouquet that's backed up by a chewy, toasty flavor profile that pours on the black fruit and character. With roundness, tannic grip and good acidity, this wine is in perfect balance and is delivering the most it can. Tempranillo, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon.",Azul,91,18,Northern Spain,Ribera del Queiles,NA,Red Blend,Guelbenzu
64620,Spain,"Prieto Picudo is a variety unknown to most wine drinkers. And that's probably a good thing, because the grape yields acidic, tight, astringent wines like this. Yes, there's color and size here, but there's not much balance or charm.",Gamonal,80,20,Northern Spain,Vino de Calidad de Tierras de León,NA,Prieto Picudo,Pardevalles
64621,Spain,"Bland as they come, with tangy white fruit and green veggies doctoring up the palate. Try as you may, there's just nothing much to latch on to. Imported by W.J. Deutsch & Sons.",NA,80,9,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Viura,Montecillo
64622,Spain,"Very red in color, an ominous indicator of what's to come. The aromas are close to raisiny and baked, while the palate sort of lugs along. There's nothing terribly offputting about this wine, yet it doesn't offer any thrill or chill.",Rosé,80,8,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Zaza
64660,Spain,"Licorice, pepper and raisin join forces on a can't-miss bouquet that's all Monastrell and all southern Spain. Dark and candied, with tons of cooked brown sugar. This is what you'd call big and tannic, with a hard, grabby mouthfeel. One glass we can recommend; two or more might be tough to handle.",Dulce,86,24,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Bodegas Silvano Garcia
64669,Spain,"Loud and basic, with ripe fruit aromas and flavors but also a detectable heaviness. The palate pushes ripe apple and pear, while the finish is big but quiet. Deep and dense but dull along the edges.",Gran Cuvée,86,18,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Gramona
64717,Spain,"Hot, earthy aromas settle on leather and tomato, while the palate is gritty and tastes of dark, smoky, chunky black fruit. More tangy and angular on the finish than desirable, with limited depth. Standard stuff on its best day.",NA,83,17,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,El Arte de Vivir
64720,Spain,"Warm and smelling of menthol, cough syrup and sweet, jammy berry fruit. The palate is also fairly medicinal in terms of flavor, while the feel is a bit hard and underdeveloped. Turns more tart and herbal the more you get to know it.",Roble,83,14,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Legón
64721,Spain,"Stemmy and leathery smelling, with heat, roasted fruit and cheesy aromas. The palate is full but soupy, with roasted, baked black fruit flavors. A bit of cinnamon and spice help out the finish, but by then the wine's very average fate has been sealed.",NA,83,9,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Rioja Vega
64726,Spain,"A little burnt and leathery smelling, with stem, bramble and raspberry aromas. The palate is sheering and tight, with semisharp acidity enlivening herbal, peppery red fruit flavors. As a whole, there isn't a lot of substance here to weigh.",NA,83,9,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Garnacha,Viña Paquita
64739,Spain,"Clearly this isn't a vintage for long keeping. In fact, one of our usual favorite Ruedas is already on the downslide.

Wait for the 2009.",NA,83,23,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,José Pariente
64764,Spain,"Full and boisterous red wine, with a ton of natural ripeness and a high pleasure quotient. We have always liked the Abadal wines, and this Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend gets both sides of the Old World/New World argument right. It's loaded with dark berry and earth aromas, which are followed by cola, blackberry and chocolate flavors. An alert, acid-driven wine with enough depth to impress.",Abadal Crianza,90,17,Catalonia,Pla de Bages,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Masies d'Avinyo
64850,Spain,"With its dried-cherry and rose-petal aromas and flavors, this beautiful, mature red is every bit the equivalent of a fine, older Bordeaux or Burgundy.

64852,Spain,"The bouquet of dried cherries, plums, prunes and tobacco opens to a palate of dense fruit that's dry and structured. This wine is big, but even textured and not heavy.

64855,Spain,"Deep, sweet dark-cherry fruit forms a solid foundation for this impressive wine. There's a touch of menthol oak on the nose; plenty of leather and earth accents in the mouth, coupled with good acidity, keep the palate complex and lively. Finishes long, with full—but not harsh—tannins. Editors' Choice.",Faustino I Rioja Gran Reserva,92,26,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Faustino
64857,Spain,"Beautifully balanced, this shows all the positive attributes of mature Rioja. Though 30 years old, it is still very alive, with deep sweet fruit that wears tobacco and meat accents.

64864,Spain,"Minty and herbal smelling, with stemmy, generic fruit aromas. The palate is sticky and creamy, while the flavors are chunky, flat and lean toward herbal berry. An oaky, syrupy wine with a mild green streak.",NA,83,17,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Colina Verde
64867,Spain,"Flat and fleshy smelling, with little zap and only soft green fruit aromas. The palate maintains some tang and citrus, while flavors of lemon and tangerine are chunky, loud and lean toward bitter on the finish.",Bajoz Ovacion,83,11,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Pagos del Rey

64876,Spain,"Nothing special about this blend of Tempranillo and Shiraz. In fact, it's more austere and less pleasing than the brand's basic 2007 Temp-Shiraz blend. That said, this wine shows thin raspberry flavors and a tangy, almost sour back end. Probably best with food; not real good on its own.",Selección Especial,83,12,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo-Shiraz,Penascal
64878,Spain,"Cherry and mild sawdust aromas are brought down by sharpness that is almost vinegar-like. The palate has an acceptable mouthfeel along with sweet and sour flavors of plum and berry.

More stewed and medicinal than anything.",NA,83,8,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Infinitus
64897,Spain,"Ripe, dark, a little oily and totally compelling from an aromatic standpoint. The palate is right where it should be, as neither the tannins nor the acidity are out of whack.

64917,Spain,"Purple in color and meaty on the nose, with a hint of raisin and reduction but not too much.

Just reaches the cut of excellence.",Fincas de Ganuza Reserva,90,51,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Remírez de Ganuza
64956,Spain,"Avinyo does not make cookie-cutter cavas, and thus this wine is out of the ordinary and not always the better for it. The nose is lean and spritzy, with aromas equal to lemon-lime. The palate is drawn in for a brut, with tart flavors. Slim in profile, but not a bad or indifferent wine.",Brut Reserva,85,16,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Avinyó

65020,Spain,"Sharp, medicinal and a little skunky to start with, and it remains acidic, tangy and hard in the mouth, with cranberry and cough medicine for flavors. Herbal and cutting on the finish. Not much to write home about.",6 Meses en Barrica,82,15,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Emina
65023,Spain,"Smells like wet cement, spearmint and light red fruits. The palate is dilute and acidic, with tangy, citrusy flavors of raspberry and cherry.

65026,Spain,"While this wine doesn't really appeal to us, we can envision fans of Old World, leaner, more acidic wines signing on. What we see, however, is a light-bodied, high-acid wine with tart, lean raspberry and cherry skin flavors and a sour finish. Fresh for sure, but hollow and in need of more.",Paradigma,82,26,Levante,Valencia,NA,Monastrell,Nuestra Familia Bodeguera
65034,Spain,"Gassy smelling and candied on the nose, with medicinal, jumpy cherry aromas. The palate is hot and hard, with underwhelming, semisour plum and berry flavors.

65125,Spain,"Full and heavy, with mango and orange juice flavors. Creamy in the mouth, with a full, foamy feel. Good citrus and apple characteristics keep it moving forward, while the weight is definitely there. Good in cava cocktails or as a Spanish mimosa.",Brut,85,11,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Paul Cheneau
65159,Spain,"This is classic Rioja Reserva, with textbook cherry, earth, leather and meaty Tempranillo flavors supported by a good acid spine and moderate tannins. The elegant finish is dry and spicy.",Faustino V Riserva,89,17,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Faustino
65162,Spain,"Candied on one hand but also gassy, barnyardy and less than clean and pure on the other. A basic mouthfeel is probably the high point, while flavors of underdeveloped berry fruit are more salty and leathery than anything. Fails to impress.",NA,82,9,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Bodegas Copaboca
65163,Spain,"Funky smelling and unfamiliar, with sweet, candied spice notes and strange candied cherry aromas. Vibrant and bouncy in terms of feel, but follows the nose by tasting sweet and weird. Weak on the finish as well.",Rojo Granrojo,82,9,Central Spain,Tierra de Castilla,NA,Garnacha,Bodegas Navarro López
65164,Spain,"Smells like compost, and never does that earthy, stenchiness lift. The palate is thick and muddled, with wan, dry, buttery raspberry flavors that lack direction. Finishes dry and bland, without much structure.",Roble,82,20,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Convento Oreja
65172,Spain,"Smells candied as well as burnt and stemmy. The palate is adequate on the surface but hollow in the middle, with dry, herbal raspberry flavors. Tastes more stemmy and distracted the longer you play with it. Not ready for prime time.",NA,82,10,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Merum
65178,Spain,"Dull aromas of raspberry and plum skins turn sweeter with air, but the palate is too centered on thick, creamy, generic berry flavors that turn raisiny and chunky with time. Not grabby or cloying, but even so this wine doesn't hit many high notes.",Al Muvedre Tinto Joven,82,16,Levante,Alicante,NA,Monastrell,Telmo Rodríguez
65182,Spain,"Jammy, sweet and extremely raisiny, with a nose that matches the palate. Low in acid, so low in pulse. Pruney on the finish and seemingly overripe. Not well balanced.",Stylo Old Vines,81,10,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Garnacha,Agustín Cubero
65183,Spain,"Colorful but aromatically defined by lean, green alfalfa, which doesn't portend much good. The palate is hard and underwhelming, with herbal, almost green berry fruit flavors. Similar on the finish. A 200,000-case product that comes across like a 200,000-case product.",Ilagares Tinto,81,8,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas San Martín
65186,Spain,"Only if you enjoy very lean, ultrafresh and tart red wines will this work. It starts with simple punchbowl aromas of red grapes and berry, and then comes a skinny, tart, grating palate that's all acid and no substance. Calling it “traditional” or a “terroir” wine would only be misleading.",NA,81,13,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Torre Castillo
65188,Spain,"A weird wine in every way. The nose smells like something off the grid, with briney fruit, funky spice notes and compost. Creamy and oaky in the mouth, with herbal flavors and a dash of nutmeg and/or cardamom. Hard on the finish, and just too strange to bother with.",Campellares,81,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodega San Pedro Apóstol
65189,Spain,"A burnt, stemmy nose is an indicator of what's to some. And while the palate has an o.k. feel to it, the flavors here are bitter, herbal and burnt. A wine that lacks freshness of fruit.",Flor del Montgó,81,12,Levante,Yecla,NA,Monastrell,Montgó
65300,Spain,"Sweet cherry and dried-rose notes on the nose are offset by some noticeable barnyardy scents. Elegant, but less generous on the palate and decidedly drier than the much older 1970, this finishes with dry tannins.",Faustino I Rioja Gran Reserva,89,72,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Faustino
65311,Spain,"Stemmy, brambly raspberry aromas lead to a scouring, light palate of snappy, sharp-tasting red cherry and plum-skin flavors. Lean to the point that it's almost sour, and overall it's stretched extremely thin.",Arderius Tinto,81,8,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Leza García
65312,Spain,"Burnt smelling at first, and tart throughout, with pie cherry and raspberry aromas and flavors. There's not much to measure here; the wine runs sour and tastes mostly of red fruit skins and citric acid. 65% Tempranillo and 35% Garnacha.",Bardosa,81,9,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Bodegas Lomablanca
65315,Spain,"Way too charred and roasted. The mouthfeel is acceptable and ranks as the best part of the wine. The rest is just a burnt, charred, overoaked mess with flavors of earthy berry, leather, peanut and resin. A poor effort that makes you wonder what the winery was thinking.",Elaboración Especial,80,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Beronia
65316,Spain,"Flat and gaseous smelling, with sulfur and no fruit to speak of. Tastes like bland nectarine and tangerine, and the body and finish are almost flabby. Borderline in terms of its acceptability.",Pindal,80,9,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo-Viura,TorresManur
65318,Spain,"Soft, chunky and fading fast, with aromas of asparagus and canned green beans. The palate is flat as a board, with vegetal flavors and bitterness on the finish. Barely worth a sip at this point in its evolution.",NA,80,15,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Aromal
65319,Spain,"If it weren't for the wine's stout color and pretty good mouthfeel, we'd sink it. The nose is green and cheesy, and the flavors are also green almost to the point of vegetal. Stemmy on the finish.",NA,80,20,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Red Blend,Finca Constancia
65322,Spain,"Heavy and definitely on the mealy side of the fence, and fighting for any semblance of balance. Pithy as well. Sadly, the citrus fruit in this wine is not that appealing.",Gotín del Risc Joven,80,15,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Godello,Abad
65323,Spain,"Quite sweaty, oily and hard, almost like an underdeveloped Verdejo or Sauvignon Blanc. The palate is also on the bitter, oily, pithy side, with only a little grapefruit and orange working their way through.",NA,80,17,Galicia,Ribeiro,NA,White Blend,Coto de Gomariz
65369,Spain,"With pretty flower blossom aromas mixed with lemon verbena, the nose on this Albariño is very nice. There's body and weight, but balance, too. Melon, citrus and mineral flavors are clean and satisfying, and the acidity is bright and entirely food-ready.",NA,89,15,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Condes de Albarei
65451,Spain,"Toasty oak and tobacco shadings are wrapped around the dark-cherry fruit core of this 100% Tempranillo wine. The full and supple palate shows good depth of fruit, leather and spice accents. This handsome modern-style Rioja finishes long and tangy, with moderate tannins.",Rioja Crianza,88,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Faustino
65501,Spain,"This blend of Tempranillo, Merlot, Cabernet and Graciano has a sultry, earthy, almost minerally nose that's backed up by blackberry, cassis and melted brown sugar flavors. Chewy and modern, with a brawny finish that houses baked-fruit notes and a dash of chocolate.",NA,89,45,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Red Blend,Señorío de Andión
65509,Spain,"A big, ripe and earthy wine, with some baked black fruit and chocolate to the nose. Far more saturated and dense than Siruela's other Ribera wines, but amid the heft there's rich plum and roasted berry flavors and good overall balance. The finish has an herbal tinge.",Élite,89,48,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Conde de Siruela
65510,Spain,"A mixture of baked fruit, bacon, asphalt and leather aromas is impressive, and so is the bright, composed palate and its flavors of plum, raspberry and tobacco. It's crisp and zesty, which is probably reflective of the cool 2002 vintage, but still it's a very nice wine with depth and dexterity. Drink now.",Vendimia Seleccionada,89,48,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Luis Alegre
65641,Spain,"The aromas are powerful and just the slightest bit brambly. A little hot and rugged on the palate, but loaded with prime black fruit, pepper and mocha notes. It's a potent wine with meaty blackness and plenty of raw power. With 65,000 cases produced, it's not a “boutique” wine, as evidenced by the friendly price tag.",Crianza,89,16,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Muruve
65790,Spain,"Violet and blackberry aromas are an inviting first act, while the palate is lush and fairly deep, with thick blackberry and mildly brambly flavors. Maybe it doesn't reach the penthouse, but as Ribera del Duero goes it more than makes the grade. 45,000 cases made.",Crianza,88,22,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Conde de Siruela
65792,Spain,"Dark plum aromas are sweetened and softened by oak-based coconut aromas, while the color and weight are deeper and darker than average. The palate is full, ripe, semicushioned but also acidic and vital, with black fruit, mocha and coffee notes. It finishes chocolaty, with a slight herbal note.",Finca Monasterio,88,55,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Baron De Ley
65798,Spain,"Not much different than the basic Sarria rosado, with maybe a touch more concentration and richness. The nose is a bit dusty, with good berry fruit notes and a whiff of cherry blossom. The palate is wet and fresh, with raspberry and plum-skin flavors. Crisp and refreshing.",Viñedo N° 5 Rosé,88,14,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Garnacha,Señorío de Sarria
65909,Spain,"This pleasant wine shows clean apple, hay and mildly floral aromas. Even and round on the tongue, it has a slightly waxy feel and decent acidity. Green apple, citrus and slightly nutty flavors play on the finish, with a crisp, dry grapefruity aftertaste that lingers. Best Buy.",NA,86,7,Central Spain,Tierra Manchuela,NA,Viura,Santana
65943,Spain,"Admittedly we are tasting this later than we'd prefer, but for an '07 it is still showing vital signs and attractive aromas of sugared pastry, candied apple and lemon-lime. The palate is mostly fresh, though not as lively as it probably was nine months ago, while the flavors of 7Up and peach are refreshing. Drink immediately or wait until the 2008 arrives.",Dona Rosa,88,25,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Adega Martínez Serantes
65968,Spain,"The “value” label from Condes de Albarei is always a good bet. Oceanic aromas and a spritz of lime make the nose just right, and the lively palate of lemon, melon and banana is charged up. Tight on the finish, with citrus and almond skins, and then a lasting impression of pineapple. Young and raring to go.",Salneval,88,10,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Condes de Albarei
66038,Spain,"Dried cherry and spice aromas and flavors accented by peppery, meaty notes mark this joven (young wine). A blend of 80% Tempranillo and 20% Mazuela, it has a light, even mouthfeel. The acids are tangy, and a little prickly now, and the bright finish shows spicy elements.",Faustino VII,86,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Faustino
66206,Spain,"A straightforward basic red, with dried cherry, oak and slightly meaty scents. The palate shows dark fruit and spice flavors, medium weight and an even texture. Finishes with decent length and tangy, spicy notes.",NA,84,7,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Santana
66240,Spain,"Opens with exotic, earthy aromas and lots of black fruit, but it turns more quiet and timid with airing. The palate shows plenty of bright acidity and some heft and grab, while the flavors of dark berries and plum are accented by light herbal notes and other common Ribera accents like thyme and oregano.",Pavo Real Crianza,88,27,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Xavier Flouret
66247,Spain,"Slightly dusty, spicy and cider-like on the nose, with a tight palate holding nectarine, melon and apple flavors. It's fairly exact in terms of mouthfeel, while the finish is clean and reflects well on the wine. Drink now.",Esencia Diviña,88,23,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Adegas Gran Vinum
66353,Spain,"This Rioja rose displays a full bouquet of rose petal, spice and the slightly meaty element that Tempranillo so often shows. No White Zinfandel, this is a fairly lean and dry wine with spicy notes, a decent match for hors d'oeuvres or light meals.",Faustino V Rosado,84,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Rosé,Bodegas Faustino
66390,Spain,"Meaty and composed, with an earthy nose that carries plenty of dark fruit and minty herbal accents. The palate shows clarity and density, but it's a touch gritty, hard and tannic. Flavors of cola, blackberry and burnt toast are masculine, while the finish is also kind of crusty and dark.",Barrancos de Pizarra,88,48,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Garnacha,Pegaso
66410,Spain,"Earthy black cherry aromas give this easygoing Rioja an honest and true nose. The palate is almost what you'd call flush, but on the other hand it's snappy and fresh, with commendable black cherry and plum flavors. With a touch of oak and mocha on the finish, it's a complete wine that should come across familiar.",Viña Zaco,87,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Bilbainas
66584,Spain,"Round, mossy and deep smelling, but austere in the mouth. A berry and plum flavor profile is infused with tomato and herbal notes, while the finish is long, healthy and cleansing. Very sturdy and Navarran in every sense because it blends juicy fruit with cool-climate typicity. Good but not for fans of sweet, bulky, superripe reds.",Crianza,87,17,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Finca Albret
66590,Spain,"Pleasant but a little light on the nose, with candied fruit notes. Flavors of green melon, apple and citrus are standard fare and clean, while the feel is fresh and peachy. A balanced and nice wine, but not overly exciting or precise. Drink now with salad or fish.",NA,87,18,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,As Laxas
66731,Spain,"Berry, earth and a touch of citrus peel make for a good bouquet, while the palate shows structure and lots of verve. The flavor profile of plum, cherry and roasted berry is solid and complete, while the finish is fresh, clean and reaches a proper finale. Call it a well-made but familiar type of old-vines Garnacha.",Tinta,87,16,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra Ribera del Jiloca,NA,Garnacha,Vega del Jiloca
66733,Spain,"Clean, fresh and layered up front, with peach, cherry and nectarine flavors and then apricot on the finish. The feel is good throughout, with no excess weight or sweetness. An uncomplicated, no-frills rosé, which is what Navarra and Señoría de Sarria do best.",Rosado,87,10,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Grenache,Señorío de Sarria
66736,Spain,"Interesting blanco from the inland Galician region of Ribeira Sacra. It's Albariño with 15% Godello, and it's ready to drink now. Aromas of pulpy peach and pineapple are nice, while the apple and lime flavors are fairly gentle and flush. Finishes with adequate freshness for an '07, making it a no-qualms type of white wine.",NA,87,16,Galicia,Ribeira Sacra,NA,Albariño,Abadía da Cova
66886,Spain,"Cuatro implies four grapes blended together, and the nose on this Tempranillo/Cab/Merlot/Syrah mix is a bit leathery and tight. In the mouth, it's linear and borderline lean, with plum and bramble flavors backstopped by tomato and herb notes. Juicy, intense and solid, but not overly generous or evolved. Typical Somontano red wine.",Cuatro,87,40,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Red Blend,Olvena
67163,Spain,"A solid, earthy style of Navarran red wine, with plum, berry and meaty aromas. The palate is forward, with solid flavors of tobacco, plum, tomato and leather. More fruity than herbal, with heat, thyme, mocha and coffee on the finish. Tastes like something from the Old World. Not currently imported.",Malón de Echaide Crianza,87,NA,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodega del Romero
67164,Spain,"Dried fruit, a touch of compost and then bold coffee and mocha aromas give the wine a decent nose, and the palate, while zesty and snappy, is endowed with pretty good raspberry, cherry and strawberry flavors. Overall it's fruity and ready to drink but fairly ordinary, and while we like the wine we can't say it's a knockout.",Barón d'Anglade,87,50,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Franco-Españolas
67297,Spain,"Gets going with earthy, lightly leathery aromas of red fruits, and that bouquet is backed by lively raspberry, plum and fresh-tomato flavors. It's not narrow, but it's hardly broad either. Finishes with a lively herbal note.",Crianza,87,14,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo,Ochoa
67317,Spain,"Look for the wine wrapped in banana-yellow paper, and you'll likely be surprised and pleased by its ripe, clean aromas and easygoing plum and cherry flavors. It's medium-bodied and nice on the palate, with a smooth, nonprobing finish. It's 75% Garnacha and 25% Tempranillo done well.",Castillo de Fuendejalon Crianza,86,8,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Aragonesas
67318,Spain,"Dark, balsamic aromas blend with hints of wood, bramble and briar to give this wine rusticity, while the palate is slick and medium in weight, with black-fruit and tea-like flavors. It's a little narrow on the finish, but there's also a creamy, oak-driven vanilla flavor that softens things up. A good wine that's 70% Tempranillo and 30% Garnacha.",Becquer,86,22,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Escudero
67485,Spain,"Put this Spanish rosado in the summer rotation. The nose gives you raspberry and strawberry aromas in light, airy form but avoids the candied side of the rosé spectrum. Pink grapefruit and nectarine flavors give it a fresh, clean, Mediterranean style.",Rosado,86,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Rosé,El Coto
67620,Spain,"Starts out sort of jumbled, with heavy aromas, deep fruit scents and a shot of leather or animal hide. The palate is healthy, however, with proper acidity pushing earthy plum and berry flavors. Shows good structure and ample size and mouthfeel. The blend is 75% Garnacha and 25% Graciano.",Sur,86,15,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Red Blend,Inurrieta
67747,Spain,"Two vintages running this is good, even-flowing rosé. The color is on the red side, but the nose dials in on fluffy red-berry aromas. Plum is the primary fruit flavor, and there's body and a flame of heat and spice to the finish. A good food wine to drink now.",NA,86,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Rosé,Tapeña
67752,Spain,"Light cherry and raspberry aromas take it to a level above neutral, while the palate is just as clean and light, with apricot, peach and strawberry flavors. With some tang and good acidity, it shows freshness and persistence.",Rosado de Lagrima,86,11,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Garnacha,Viña Sardasol
67753,Spain,"Initially it smells a bit cheesy and drawn, but with time it evolves to show plum, raspberry and tire rubber aromas. In the mouth, it's tight, fresh and a little gritty, with red-fruit flavors of cherry and raspberry. Not overly generous in terms of mouthfeel, but it does push the fruit until the final bell. More of a food wine than a solo sipper.",Reserva,86,12,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Malumbres
67756,Spain,"Opens with marshmallow-like sweetness on the nose, but that changes to lean fruit and saline with time. The palate is solid and zesty, with standard Rioja-style plum, berry and dill flavors. It's a fresh but quiet wine, with a tight body, medium tannins and pretty good flavors. Well done but nothing unusual.",Reserva,86,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Montecillo
67758,Spain,"Ochoa usually puts out a good rosado made from Garnacha, and this vintage keeps the winery's reputation intact. It starts with fresh peachy aromas and then comes on with light berry and peach flavors. Arguably a bit candied, but perfectly good for summer quaffing.",Rosado,86,9,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Garnacha,Ochoa
67766,Spain,"Light aromas of melon, apple and pear are just fine, and the mildly chunky palate sporting apple-based flavors is good, as is the pineapple finish.

68239,Spain,"The best new release in the Eguren family's collection of modern Rioja wines is this small-production, 100% Tempranillo.

68373,Spain,"Classic in color, and backed by aromatics of lavender, graphite and pure blackberry. This is not overly weighty, as the acidity keeps it pointed and pure.

68374,Spain,"Masculine and heady stuff, as leather, espresso, smoked meat, mocha and intense blackberry aromas set the stage for an intense, driven, structured palate that's full of coconut, vanilla bean, cocoa and pure plum and berry.

68375,Spain,"What a superb combination of new oak, leather, mineral, mocha and berry fruit this wine delivers.

Best in a few more years.",Finca El Bosque,95,145,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
68376,Spain,"Full and ready, this fabulous wine from Rioja Alavesa sets the bar very high for any of its Vanguardia co-runners. Gloria hits hard with bacon, tire rubber, tobacco and pastry crust aromas, but also pure dark fruit. Then it's wave after wave of boysenberry and crisped brown sugar flavors prior to a finale of heady European chocolate.

68382,Spain,"Plant-by-plant fruit selection leads to intensity, concentration and structure. Aro shows gripping tannins and juicy acidity, and overall it reeks of power and precision.

68390,Spain,"Only a select portion of a prized 30-year-old vineyard gives fruit to the wine named after the Eguren brothers' great grandfather.

It's definitely tighter and more compact than the more generous, richer 2005 La Nieta. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",La Nieta,93,145,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Viñedos de Paganos
68490,Spain,"Herbal aromas come with bell pepper and berry fruit notes, while the palate is solid in terms of feel but shows classic Navarran flavors of jalapeño and green pepper. Good texture and mouthfeel, but probably too green for a lot of people. Tempranillo with Merlot and Cabernet is the blend.",Dimension Crianza,85,12,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Otazu
68520,Spain,"A very pretty middle-aged wine that has at least another decade in it. At this point in time, the nose is still showing a lot of black-fruit aromas, while the palate is chewy, meaty and rich as it spreads out with ripe flavors mixed with touches of mushroom, truffle and vanilla.

68536,Spain,"Char and chocolate, then a dollop of rum raisin and black cherry, and there is your nose. This version of Cirsion, one of our very favorite modern Riojas, is relatively soft, raisiny and simple, and for that it doesn't quite rate with some of the past vintages, which were spectacular. But that doesn't mean you won't love the wine's smooth texture, cocoa and baked berry flavors, and its overall generous character.

68538,Spain,"Right away this shows the requisite signs of excellence. The meaty, earthy, leathery, full-fruit nose is just right, and the palate is elevated in how it is infused with pure blackberry and plum as well as chocolate and fine herbs. Finishes with class and kick. Best from 2008–2011.",Altos de Lanzaga,92,82,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Telmo Rodríguez
68539,Spain,"Like all young Sierra Cantabria wines made from old vines, this has a purple color that's supported by aromas of coffee, mocha and black fruits. It's half aged in American oak (the other half is French), and it's much more tannic, acidic and structured than the fleshy 2003. A wine with pure flavors and a dynamic structure. Just under 1,000 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Colección Privada,92,48,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
68544,Spain,"Benjamin Romeo makes nothing but big, idiosyncratic wines. And some are big hits while others may not be your thing. This modern, round, polished blend is creamy and smooth but also loaded with almond, pear, citrus and toast flavors. Certainly there's a strong wood element, but it handles it with aplomb and oozes class. Drink as soon as possible. It won't age much past 2007. Only 25 cases made.",Qué Bonito Cacareaba,92,74,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Benjamin Romeo
68548,Spain,"Robust and sexy, with smoke, leather and pure berry and plum aromas that make for a sensational bouquet. The palate is up to the precedent set by the nose, as the cherry and cola flavors are outright lovely. For what you get, this is almost a value. It shows us what that Muga can do in a great vintage.",Selección Especial Reserva,92,37,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Muga
68549,Spain,"Stylish and serious, with polished, fancy oak sitting like royalty atop dark   fruit that is almost pruney. The palate hits with a solid smack of blackberry, while a secondary layer delivers chocolate, mocha and spice. Not quite at the level of the classic 2001 but still excellent.",El Puntido,92,54,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Viñedos de Paganos
68644,Spain,"Sweet and sour aromas amount to a prickly bouquet, while the palate has some flesh as well as freshness. Nectarine and spiced apple flavors are solid but pithy, and overall the wine is good but lacks concentration. Good for everyday quaffing.",Gran Feudo Rosado,85,15,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Rosé,Bodegas Julián Chivite
68645,Spain,"The opening of earth, berry and leather aromas is solid enough, yet the palate is quite acidic, yielding semitart but exact flavors of pie cherry and plum. The finish is tight, with light oak touches. But overall it's on the angular side, with a bit of the razor's edge in terms of acidity.",Inspiración,85,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Valdemar
68660,Spain,"Cherry and dried cranberry aromas along with the magenta color give this wine a “red” personality, which is confirmed by the crisp red-fruit flavor profile. Fairly light in weight, but juicy and fresh, with cleansing acidity and some sharpness.",Sombrero Rojo Crianza,84,17,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Barriosa
68696,Spain,"It has taken this bodega a few years to get it right, but in 2004 this blend of 80% Tempranillo and 20% Cabernet is dark and rocking. The nose offers that modern but increasingly familiar blast of bacon, baked fruit pastry and leather, and the palate works its magic with black plum and smoked game flavors. If it were just a touch longer and richer toward the finish it might rank as a nuevo classico.",Finca Monasterio,91,42,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Baron De Ley
68799,Spain,"Initial aromas are squarely in the bell pepper/jalapeño mode, and later moss and earth enter the picture. The palate is basic, a bit acidic, and saucy, with herbal red-fruit flavors and a finish of tomato and basil. Struggles a little, but solid in a “country” sort of way. The blend is Tempranillo, Garnacha, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon.",Reserva,84,40,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Alconde
68803,Spain,"Tan in color and smelling fairly oxidized. Aromas of peach pits and blanched almond lack freshness, while the palate veers more toward applesauce than fresh fruit. There's some life left but not enough to make it a recommended wine. Tastes, feels and smells sort of jumbled.",NA,84,23,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Pazo de Barrantes
68804,Spain,"Chunky spiced apple and saline aromas get the wine off on so-so footing, and the apple and grapefruit flavors come with weight. Citrus takes over on the finish, but it's kind of pithy. Doesn't seem as fresh as it should be for a brand new '08.",NA,84,15,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Nessa
68820,Spain,"With its spice and fig aromas, this registers as a rich, mature Rioja reserva. The palate runs toward sweet plums and blackberry, while the finish is mildly toasty and full, with coffee as the lasting flavor. This has many good qualities, not the least of which is balance and a touch of citrus peel. Best now–2010. 525 cases produced.",Cata de Consejero,91,58,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Consejo de la Alta
68821,Spain,"A sweet, ripe, jammy style for Roda I, with smooth tannins, corpulence and more than adequate minerality and power. This is not a flabby wine despite the heat of the vintage, and the lush cassis, blackberry and mocha notes come together on the back palate and finish.",Roda I,91,73,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Roda
68822,Spain,"Thick, brooding and aromatically mature, this delivers heft, grab and balance. It has developed black-fruit flavors followed by a cushioned, soft finish. Drink now and over the next several years as the 2001 gets better and the promising but not yet released 2004 begins to settle. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Reserva,91,77,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Remírez de Ganuza
68827,Spain,"You're going to like this masculine, well-oaked blend of 80% Tempranillo with 10% each Graciano and Garnacha. It's got modern touches but a lot of tradition as well. The wine is rich and round, with tobacco, coffee, chocolate and earth creating depth and character. With fine mouthfeel and a solid finish, you can drink now or hold a few more years.",Coto Real Reserva,91,46,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,El Coto
68831,Spain,"This seems eminently ageworthy; it has the strong foundation and pulsing acidity required of a true cellar dweller. The raspberry and plum fruit have a beam of acidity and the tannins are not shy. Shows all the hallmarks of a fine modern Rioja: power, purity and balance. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Torre Muga,91,90,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Muga
68837,Spain,"A dense wine from the start, and each subsequent whiff of the oaky but vital nose is convincing. The palate here is exemplary, especially for an '02; there's dark berry and plum flavors backed by notes of black licorice and pepper. An exceedingly nice wine with a textbook mix of tannins, flesh and acidity.",Reserva,91,28,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Ostatu
68952,Spain,"Early tobacco and mint aromas quickly yield to mossy black fruit, and in the mouth it's fresh and zesty, with mild green-pepper infused plum and cassis flavors. Quite crisp and lean, with herbal influences showing up at all points. Classic Navarran red wine.",Crianza,84,13,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Señorío de Sarria
68960,Spain,"With raisiny, damp aromas and a flat body, we can only label this Marqués de Murrieta high-ender a miss. While not a disaster, you'd expect more from something labeled Gran Reserva Especial, but instead it fails to capture the essence of Rioja and shows heavy cola, blackberry and truffle flavors as well as deep, dull tannins. Overripe to begin with?",Castillo Ygay Gran Reserva Especial,84,54,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Marqués de Murrieta
68973,Spain,"Broad-shouldered and muscled-up, this hearty wine seems more youthful than it is. The nose is spicy and full of lively berry aromas, while the palate is laced with red cherry, raspberry and vanilla. It's a classic gran reserva with dried qualities and spice. It's right on the money.",Coto de Imaz Gran Reserva,91,39,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,El Coto
68979,Spain,"Bramble, cherry cola and snappy red berry aromas announce this as a secure, snappy wine. The flavor profile is round, genial and nicely balanced between plum and berry and vanilla/mocha notes. Like most Sierra Cantabria reds, this touches all the bases and should elicit a smile of satisfaction.",Cuvée Especial,91,24,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
69099,Spain,"Light cherry and mild sulfuric aromas are standard fare for this class of wine, while the palate is snappy and fresh, with sweet-and-sour cherry and strawberry flavors. Finishes a little gritty and candied, but pleasant enough overall.",Tinto Barrica,84,8,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Red Blend,Don Ramón
69110,Spain,"Varietal Graciano is something we frequently see, and very rarely does it bowl us over. This wine has jumpy cherry and lemon peel aromas, and the flavors are tight, a touch sour and run toward cherry and red plum. Fruity for certain, but lacking in charm and mouthfeel.",Viñedo N° 7,84,15,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Graciano,Señorío de Sarria
69111,Spain,"Round, big and medicinal, with clumsy, roasted berry fruit aromas. The palate isn't overly charming, and the flavors of tomato paste, cranberry and herbal red fruit are curious. Finishes cleansing and zesty, but with another wave of tomato-based flavors. Shows a lot of cool-climate, mountain influence.",Hache Garnacha-Syrah,84,65,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Red Blend,Olvena
69114,Spain,"Baked berry and raisin aromas raise questions about the wine's overall balance, while the plate is sharp and acidic yet tastes of raisin, prune and dried apricots. Rather grabby on the finish. Think slam dancing when approaching this Tempranillo-Garnacha blend.",Señorío de Unx Crianza,83,11,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas San Martín
69118,Spain,"Is it (MS) or the wine? This vintage of Cáceres rosé seems o.k., but nothing more than a splash across the palate. Cotton candy aromas and grapefruit and orange flavors are what they are. Not bad so long as it's fresh, but it's hard to locate much charm or individuality.",NA,83,9,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Rosé,Marqués de Cáceres
69139,Spain,"Dark mineral, toasted French oak and black fruit carry the nose. This is a sturdy, nicely made high-end Rioja, but due to the heat of the year its range of flavors is narrow as it settles on baked plum and molasses. Medium long on the finish, with a lasting taste of chocolate.",Dalmau,90,100,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marqués de Murrieta
69242,Spain,"Salinic, eggy and simply not that fresh. Maybe it's the wine or maybe it's past its prime, but for Albariño it's not showing much. The palate is soft and flat, with fleshy flavors of muddled apple. And the wine just splats against your palate without delivering any grace or cut.",Gran Vinum,83,26,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Adegas Gran Vinum
69275,Spain,"Stylish and alluring nose; quite sexy. The malolactic fermentation took place in barrel, so the wine has mouthfeel and richness. Yet it's a juicy, friendly, fruit-forward style of Tempranillo, one that finishes with mocha and wood-driven spice notes. 20,000 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Allende,90,30,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Finca Allende
69299,Spain,"Earthy and fully ripe, with classic Rioja aromas of sweet leather, herbs and a touch of raisin. But once you get it onto the palate you'll be impressed with the roundness of the body and the depth of the cola, cherry and plum flavors. Finishes with cocoa, buttered toast and width. Drink now through 2008.",Reserva,90,29,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Consejo de la Alta
69401,Spain,"A tough wine to enjoy. The nose has a cheesy top layer, while the base aromas are of bell pepper and lettuce. It's very tangy and juicy in the mouth, with searing red-cherry flavors and green accents. Snappy and whispy to the max.",Crianza,82,9,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Príncipe de Viana
69428,Spain,"Blackberry and cola are the prime aromas that comprise the alluring bouquet. And as you'd expect, there's also leather and spicy wood thrown in. In the mouth, it's an intense ride of rich black cherry and plum. For now it's a little closed on the finish; will likely be better in three years.",Seleccion Personal,89,49,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Abel de Mendoza
69460,Spain,"Seductive and classy aromas of sandalwood, cola, spice, licorice and leather amount to pretty much everything you could ask for. Ripe and complex in terms of its earth and tree-fruit flavors. Finishes svelte and sturdy, but with ample vanilla, toffee and tobacco nuances. Classic gran reserva. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Coto de Imaz Gran Reserva,91,38,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,El Coto
69461,Spain,"Top-notch manzanilla, plain and simple. What's not plain and simple is the fact that this is so pure and smooth that it dances across your palate. From the vanilla and almond on the nose to the pastry and mushroom on the palate to the creamed butter on the finish, this is as good as it gets in this class.",Manzanilla,91,9,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L.
69540,Spain,"The previous two years we did not find this wine to be worthy of a rating. This time, we rate it but note that it's an almost-red wine made from Cabernet Sauvignon. It's sweet smelling, with fiery plum-skin flavors that evaporate along with the mouthfeel. Leaves a burn patch on the finish. Particular to the max.",Rosé,82,18,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon,1+1=3
69575,Spain,"For a good price you get a lot of white wine here. Muga barrel ferments this Viura, so there's popcorn and richness to the nose, but it's not overwhelming. And in the mouth, the lemon, orange and tangerine flavors are flat-out lovely. Pour a glass of this with your next platter of sizzling garlic shrimp and you'll be in heaven.",NA,89,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Viura,Muga
69581,Spain,"Good color and intriguing aromas of baked fruit, tobacco and mint indicate that you're getting some modern-styled ripeness along with traditional Rioja earth, spice and old man's library. The palate is juicy and mildy fruity, while the finish pushes chocolate, vanilla, baking spice and tannins. Drinkable now but will age for another five years without a problem.",Limited Edition,89,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Ramón Bilbao
69583,Spain,"Ysios is one of the most visually pleasing wineries you'll see. It was designed by Santiago Calatrava and it's the town of Laguardia's modern stamp. But until now the wines were just average. This one, however, is far better than that, with pure dried cherry and raspberry flavors bolstered by spicy oak, vanilla and perfect acidity. Drink now–2009. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.",Reserva,89,30,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Ysios
69598,Spain,"Smooth berries and plenty of dark licorice carry the seductive bouquet. And seeing that this is Remelluri's signature high-priced red, you should expect the fine berry, plum and chocolate flavors that rest comfortably on the palate. But like many '02s, the wine has a hard mouthfeel and pronounced acidity, so it doesn't quite trigger all the pleasure points that it might in a better vintage.",Colección Jaime Rodríguez,89,104,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,"Granja Ntra, Sra. de Remelluri"
69599,Spain,"Bramble bush, graphite, leather and medium-depth fruit are the opening notes on this qualm-free, fairly muscular Rioja. Dark cherry and raspberry flavors run the palate, and they are followed by a warm, milk chocolate-tinged finish. Very nice for a 2002.",Remelluri,89,31,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,"Granja Ntra, Sra. de Remelluri"
69608,Spain,"A real surprise! Who in their right mind could expect so much quality from a Cab Franc-Tempranillo blend from Penedès? But try it and we guarantee you're going to like it. The nose is meaty, ripe and round, while the palate features pure core fruit backed by chocolaty warmth. With kick as well as subtlety, this is a bargain hunter's dream. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",NA,91,12,Catalonia,Pla de Bages,NA,Red Blend,Masies d'Avinyo
69627,Spain,"Still young and jumpy, but the ripeness and pedigree of this Penedès bruiser is beyond reproach. It's big, bold and deep as a mountain lake, with black plum, bullion and a pile of blackberry on the palate. Tons of extract and tannins make this inky, saturated heavyweight a wine to ponder. For fans of forward, beefy reds. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",Grans Muralles,91,100,Catalonia,Conca de Barberà,NA,Red Blend,Torres
69742,Spain,"Black cherry and toasty oak aromas greet you, followed by racy raspberry flavors. There's a lot of acid, but there's also ample berry flesh and texture to handle it. Shows good quality overall but also some of 2002's lean character. Drink now with food and it won't be any trouble.",Señorío de Cuzcurrita,88,40,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Castillo de Cuzcurrita
69766,Spain,"Alluring cherry and berry aromas show a touch of candied sweetness, yet overall the bouquet is magnetically attractive. And the palate is deep and spicy, with tons of red fruit accented by toast and chocolate. And as far as complexity notes go, there's rose petal, lavender and leather. Eminently drinkable; excellent quality to price ratio. Imported by Allied Domecq Wines USA.",Gran Reserva,90,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Campo Viejo
69779,Spain,"A touch of early aromatic raisin gives way to spice, tobacco, tomato and cherry, while the palate is ripe and rich, with flavors of raspberry syrup and prune.

69898,Spain,"A little bit leafy and light, but that's traditional Rioja for you. The color is a mix of orange and red, while the palate of snappy red fruits is beginning to slip toward peach and nectarine. If you like a leaner, racier style of wine, then drink this now. It's probably at its peak.",Faustino I Rioja Gran Reserva,88,30,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Faustino
69914,Spain,"Quite yellow, with toffee, peanuts and light fruit aromas. Big and round in the mouth, with dried apple, almond and white pepper flavors. Full and long late, with tons of texture and a strong mushroom accent. Powerful, so you'd better be a fino fan if you're going to tackle this one.",Fino Marismeno Reservas,90,15,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Sanchez Romate
69999,Spain,"Fans of big, blocky reds that offer punch, extract and tannins should jump on this now, and then watch it age nicely for the next four or five years. That's the type of meaty, tannic, fruit-infused Tempranillo this is. It's always going to be short and stocky, but still it will round into shape as it matures.",Crianza,88,19,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Ostatu
70004,Spain,"Early leather and animal aromas soon yield to brighter fruit scents, and that's followed up by a palate detailed by cherry and plum flavors. This nice, comfortable wine offers freshness and texture; it's a very good crianza that nails the relationship between fruit and oak.",Crianza,88,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Loriñon
70006,Spain,"A heavier, more elevated style, but still well-priced relative to the competition. Expect lusty toast and berry aromas along with a round but juicy palate that delivers chewy berry and plum flavors and some “grasa,” which means fat in Spanish. A cut above most wines in this price range.",Seis de Luberri,88,14,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Luberri
70020,Spain,"Rock solid, with spice, leather and piercing oak on the nose. Snappy and upright on the palate, with tons of berry fruit and nice smoky shadings. Balanced and nuanced, with vanilla, licorice, toast and spice on the finish. A winner. Imported by Five Star Imports.",Clos Monlleó,90,60,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Sangenís I Vaqué
70039,Spain,"Massive yet proportional, with olive, rubber and ripe black fruit on the manly bouquet. The palate is ponderous but tasty, with a huge dose of syrupy berry and black-plum flavors. Ripe as all get out, with firm tannins. To call it a powerhouse would be taking things lightly. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Tinto,90,46,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Red Blend,Luna Beberide
70085,Spain,"Bouquet is nice and smooth, with an earthy warmth surrounding scents of purple flowers and crushed berries. The palate is lively and acidic, with semisweet red-fruit flavors that are more generic. No reticence here; the wine is racy to the end as it finishes with oak and vanilla.",Jarrarte,88,29,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Abel de Mendoza
70086,Spain,"Alert and snappy on the nose, with no “hot” or stewy characteristics from the steamy year. Raspberry and cassis flavors are supported by tight, crisp oak, while the finish offers mineral, coffee and cherry essence. A solid wine from a hellishly warm vintage.",Roda Reserva,88,48,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Roda
70088,Spain,"Stout and generally quite pure, with aromas of leather and berries that thicken and gather density with airing. The palate is your standard new-age blend of dark cherry and raspberry, while the finish is oaky, warm and spicy. Very nice, if a touch jammy and simple.",Mirto,88,38,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Ramón Bilbao
70105,Spain,"Plenty of dusty, spicy aromas run the nose, almost to the exclusion of ripe fruit. But once it opens the wine displays savory flavors as well as some pure dark berry. On the finish, it's a touch lean and crisp, but overall this is a balanced Rioja reserva with spunk.",Reserva,87,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Montecillo
70106,Spain,"A little leafy, a little spicy and a little bit of a throwback to the days when Rioja wasn't taken so seriously. This has light cinnamon oak shadings followed by cola, tobacco and sweet berry flavors. Somewhat acidic and sheer, so better with food; drink now.",Crianza,87,14,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marqués de la Concordia
70107,Spain,"A juicy, prickly wine with pungent red-fruit aromas backed by tangy cherry, raspberry and currant flavors. It's firm and tight, entirely reflective of the cool vintage, and the bet here is that it's unlikely to ever lose that inherent toughness. Needs food to absorb the crispness. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Reserva,87,77,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Remírez de Ganuza
70136,Spain,"Almost orange in color but fairly lively on the nose, where cherry, vanilla, leather and licorice come together.

Imported by Five Star Imports.",Gran Reserva,89,21,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Casa de la Reina
70169,Spain,"Beautifully composed, with power and just as much precision and pizzazz. The nose offers lightly baked berry fruit notes, leather and spice, while the palate is loaded with tobacco, exotic spices and the finest natural berry flavors Spain has to offer. Smooth, elegant, finessed and potent, with integrated tannins and bold acidity that will keep it going for at least a decade. Drink from 2012 through 2018.",Malleolus de Valderramiro,97,180,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto Fino,Emilio Moro
70173,Spain,"Tilts a bit toward the ripe side, with sweet, mature aromas of blueberry, raisin and vanilla. It's fleshy and soft in terms of feel, with earthy, warm flavors of fig, berry and molasses. Drink now for its traditional integrity and tobacco-like qualities; it's not improving.",Coto De Imaz Reserva,87,23,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,El Coto
70182,Spain,"A little tight and reticent, but airing reveals aromas of raisin, marzipan and earth. The palate is measurably peppier, with lean but healthy red-fruit flavors stepping up and demanding to be noticed. As for feel, expect grabby tannins and shortness. Probably at its best now but will hold steady for at least five more years.",Conde de Valdemar Gran Reserva,87,25,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Valdemar
70208,Spain,"Spicy and exotic, with tight fruit and plenty of tannin in the mouth. There's a lot of juicy blackberry flavors along with full-force acids and verve. Tight as a drum, with some rough edges that should mellow over the next year or so. A wine to watch from a region that's showing its stuff. Imported by Bon Vivant Imports.",Crianza,89,27,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Rejadorada
70221,Spain,"Quite ripe, with a touch of stewiness that settles with time and morphs into a pool of ripe cherries, berries and raisins. More soft than hard, with easygoing tannins and a meaty, chunky finish laced with licorice and cured meat. Dense and chewy. Imported by Five Star Imports.",Coranya,89,45,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Sangenís I Vaqué
70222,Spain,"Lots of bacon, leather and earth coat the nose of this vanguard-style Rioja, but unlike the spectacular 2001, the '02 is not nearly as deep and ethereal. Blame the cool, wet vintage and take solace in the fact that it's still a rich, almost syrupy red with integrated tannins and lushness. What's missing is the wine's patented layering and complexity. Imported by Jorge Ordoñez/Fine Estates from Spain.",NA,89,49,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,San Vicente
70235,Spain,"Talk about magnetic aromas of bacon, tobacco and bold black fruit, and then comes an oak-rich palate full of coconut, butter, chocolate and exotic berry flavor.

70255,Spain,"Make room in the cellar for this heavyweight! Talk about a monster wine; but there's also finesse, character and style to it. Alabaster is the top wine from the Eguren family's new Toro winery, and it's big, tannic and loaded with spice, molasses and syrupy black fruit flavors. Rich, long and fierce on the finish, with tannins and heat to resolve. Best from 2012 through 2020.",Alabaster,94,250,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Teso La Monja
70271,Spain,"Plenty of red berry and jam greet you on the nose, and beyond that there's sweet barrel notes and a little wood smoke. It's smart and snappy on the palate, but not all that long or complex. Finishing notes of tobacco add interest. Tasty and ready to go now.",Crianza,87,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Ramón Bilbao
70279,Spain,"A good effort in a tough year, and frankly we're happy that Muga decided to make a reserva in 2002. The wine shows lean aromas of dried red fruit, tomato leaf and dill. In fact, dill is a recurring theme from front to back. And along the way there's acids, red cherries, plums and currants. Good but leaner than a normal Muga effort.",Reserve,87,23,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Muga
70280,Spain,"Early aromas of leather, rubber and char sort of shadow the fruit component. But in the mouth there's ample blackberry, cherry and pepper, all of which bring the wine into form. In terms of mouthfeel, it's good. And on the finish it's got some of that espresso bitterness that sings of toasted barrels.",La Vendimia,87,30,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Palacios Remondo
70282,Spain,"Healthy in look, with tobacco, dried spices and pure wood notes on the nose. The palate is drizzled with plum and berry flavors, but there's also ample tobacco and tomato-leaf accents.

70306,Spain,"Mature but not even close to expiring, with cola, root beer, tree bark and leather on the bouquet. Fairly acidic, which is why it has so much verve at 10+ years.

70313,Spain,"Clean, nutty and smooth, if a touch neutral on the nose. The palate pushes more nuts and distant white fruits, followed by a finish of fleur de sel and cashew butter. Slightly heavy but that's the style; like its sister manzanilla, this wine is very consistent year to year.",La Ina Fino,88,14,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Domecq
70314,Spain,"Quite international in style, a direct reflection of the Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah components that comprise the wine. That said, this is probably the best wine Martinez Bujanda has made at its La Mancha winery; it's plump and ripe, with nice cherry and plum flavors. It's medium in weight and length, and juicy. Likable as can be. Imported by CIV/USA.",Reserva,88,15,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Red Blend,Finca Antigua
70326,Spain,"A touch doughy on the nose, with prune and blackberry aromas that are neither pushy nor aggressive. The palate is ripe, rich and just forward enough, with blackberry, wild berry, coffee and fudge flavors. Settles nicely on the finish, and overall this wine shows almost all of what's good about modern Ribera del Duero wines. 250 cases made; drink now through 2015.",Tinto Figuero Noble,93,131,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,García Figuero
70343,Spain,"Outstanding Sherry with complexity, richness and character. The nose has a salinic zest to it, making it no wallflower, and of course there's raisin and prune. The palate is formed, sculpted and balanced, with peanut M&M;'s candy, roasted fruit, chocolate ice cream and more. A beauty with power and poise.",Matusalem Oloroso Dulce Viejo,93,45,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,González Byass
70347,Spain,"This is the tier-two wine from the Egurens' new Toro project, and it's stellar. Intense aromas of black fruit, char and mint start it out, and next up come cola, roasted black fruit, clove and cured-meat flavors. Oak is forward now, but it should settle in a year or so. A dynamite Toro to drink from 2011 through 2018.",Victorino,93,71,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Teso La Monja
70349,Spain,"A wonderfully balanced and giving wine with sweet raisin and prune aromas and an overall richness akin to crude oil. Flavors of baked black plum, brown sugar and molasses are both juicy and rich, and then toffee and mocha take over on the finish. Sweet and thick for sure, but with discernible fruit and vitality.",Noe Viejo,93,45,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Pedro Ximénez,González Byass
70350,Spain,"Smooth up front, with a light veil of oak sitting on top of black fruit. In the mouth, flavors of raspberry and plum satisfy in a juicy, medium-depth sort of way, while the finish is cushioned by chocolate and vanilla notes. A crianza that gets it right.",Conde de Valdemar Crianza,87,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Valdemar
70368,Spain,"Color and size are readily apparent but gaps appear between the layers. For starters, the nose doesn't have the purity and density that it could; and the palate also shows some weakness where structure and quality of fruit meet. Otherwise, it's a ripe and modern red wine with some lushness and depth.",Mirto,87,65,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Ramón Bilbao
70377,Spain,"Round, clean and a touch leathery, but not penetrating or dense. For a nice, smooth red wine with some plum and cinnamon spice, look no further. This crianza is easygoing, lightly oaked and good throughout.",Crianza,87,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marqués de Cáceres
70386,Spain,"Full and ripe, with tobacco and a certain earthy nuttiness to the nose. Raspberry and plum are the leading flavors, while the mouthfeel is both textured as well as juicy. Full in the middle, with a likable personality. Imported by Five Star Imports.",Reserva,88,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Hermosa
70390,Spain,"Spicy and saucy on the nose, with some leather and cherry mixed in. Shows attractive cherry and tobacco flavors, and they are supported by ripe, pure tannins. This is a tight, ripe wine that is drinkable now and should hold for another couple of years at the very least. Imported by Five Star Imports.",Negre,88,17,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Celler Cecilio
70402,Spain,"Gets off the blocks with Middle Eastern spice notes of cumin and curry, but later on open-cut wood and vanilla take over. Bold cherry, blackberry and black olive flavors are solid, while the mouthfeel is tannic and rowdy. Possibly too grabby for some, but if you like Tempranillo taken to the extreme this might be your ticket. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Real Reserva,88,24,Northern Spain,Cigales,NA,Tempranillo,Museum
70409,Spain,"Big and toasty, with graphite, rubber and leather accenting pure black-fruit aromas. This is one ripe, tannic Rioja, but it's pure and the berry flavors sing a nice song. Solid on the finish, with length and feel. Shows the right stuff without blowing you away. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",NA,88,30,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Pujanza
70412,Spain,"Nice, brawny and integrated, with sexy aromas of wild berry, dark plum, leather and earth. The palate has the right weight and tannic grab, while the flavors of black fruit, fine herbs, cola and coffee are measured yet generous. Finishes with driving chocolate and vanilla flavors. Drink now through 2016.",Old Vines Unfiltered,93,89,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Remírez de Ganuza
70426,Spain,"Teso la Monja is the new Toro winery from the Eguren family of Rioja fame (former owners of Numanthia-Termes in Toro), and it's proof that no beat has been missed since they sold out to Moët Hennessy. Expect dark, intense black fruit aromas and flavors mixed with heat, tannin, cola and spice. Some oak creeps out on the finish, but overall this is a lovely, bullish Toro. Drink now through 2014.",Almirez,92,22,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Teso La Monja
70457,Spain,"A nominally sweet red-candy note helps define the upbeat nose, and it all makes sense once you know that there's 20% Garnacha in the wine along with 75% Tempranillo and Mazuelo. With airing you get nice pie cherry and raspberry flavors, while the mouthfeel is juicy and correct. A good wine for pizza or hamburgers. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.",Crianza,86,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Campo Viejo
70468,Spain,"Ready as it will ever be, this mildly baked red starts with minty aromas and chocolate. The palate is saturated and full of fruit, but the feel is a touch thin given the color and the lightly cooked aromas. Drink now with food and it will satisfy.",Primum Vitae Crianza,86,17,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Vallformosa
70484,Spain,"Rich and pruney, with bold, reduced black fruit aromas along with chocolate and spice. Compact and delicious in the mouth, with caramel, black coffee and other yummy, unctuous flavors. So thick it pours like motor oil, thus feel free to drink it like a wine or pour it on vanilla ice cream as you might a syrup.",Don Guido Aged 20 Years Rare Old Sweet,92,50,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Pedro Ximénez,Williams & Humbert
70500,Spain,"This is an easy, sweeter style of Viura that emits aromas of peaches and pears. The palate is lively enough but not exactly zesty, and the flavors run toward pink grapefruit and other citrus fruits; but think sweet, nice fruits—not sour ones. Has all the hallmarks of a good aperitif wine.",Cosecha,86,11,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Ostatu
70505,Spain,"Racy on the nose, with tea, pepper and pine scents along with basic red-fruit aromas. The palate is zingy and fairly trim, with strawberry and raspberry flavors. Finishes fresh and snappy, with a shot of tartness. Drink now. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.",Gran Reserva,86,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Campo Viejo
70540,Spain,"Deep purple in color, with roasted, rubbery aromas of wild blackberry. Thick, lush and rich in the mouth, with mellow tannins (for a Priorat wine) and big, broad flavors of plum, blackberry and herbs. Smooth on the finish, with black tea notes and leftover oak. Has a lot going for it; drink now through 2012.",Cartoixa,91,52,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Scala Dei
70544,Spain,"A genuinely attractive, well-made old vines red with earthy, minerally aromas along with violet petal and blackberry. The palate has a fine feel to it, depth and complexity, while flavors of dry berry and baking spices work wonders. Dry, pure and long on the finish, and really quite excellent for a vino de tierra. Drink now through 2014.",Dominus Gran Selección Viñedos Viejos,91,50,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Yllera
70565,Spain,"A throwback Rioja that sports tobacco, mulch and some true Old-World aromas that make you question the wine's health. But airing breathes life and tilts it toward dried cherries. Finally you discover core power hammered home by hard tannins, sharp acidity and an odd nuttiness. Not a wine for all tastes.",Reserva,86,30,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Dominio de Conte
70573,Spain,"As always, this gracious white wine made from the Viura grape delivers the goods. In this case, it's pineapple and pear aromas in front of pleasant apple and fresh celery flavors. There's even some honeyed apple to the finish. Light, liquidy and never bad when served properly chilled.",NA,86,7,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Viura,Marqués de Cáceres
70589,Spain,"For unafflicted plum and berry character, this young, fresh Rioja has the goods. The sweet berry and cherry palate is at peak drinking condition, and the finish runs longer than expected courtesy of a beam of bright acidity. A wine with Zinfandel-like charm. Imported by Pernod Ricard USA.",Crianza,85,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Campo Viejo
70592,Spain,"Rich, dense and syrupy, but also showing touches of mint and leather on the nose. Quite sticky in the mouth, but with lovely toffee and mocha flavors that set up a finish that runs on and on. Impressive depth of flavor, nice overall balance and a mix of complexity and flat-out richness make this PX a winner.",Nectar Dulce,91,18,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Pedro Ximénez,González Byass
70601,Spain,"Round, stylish and wholesome on the nose, with wild berry, smoke, spice and not too much obvious oak. The palate is racy and forward, but also offers subtleties including dry fruit, spice, fresh tomato and wild herbs such as thyme and sage. Long and warm on the finish, with vanilla. Drink now through 2015.",Fincas de Ganuza Reserva,91,48,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Remírez de Ganuza
70608,Spain,"Dense and heavy, and maybe a touch dull on the nose in terms of fruit aromas. But once it hits the palate the wine shines with intense black fruit, sugar beet and chocolate flavors. The finish is toasty and warm, with saturation and texture. Almost over the edge as far as ripeness, but not quite. Drink now through 2012.",Vendimia Seleccionada,91,59,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,García Figuero
70609,Spain,"Another impressive Oloroso from Gonzalez Byass. This is a sweet, dark, brooding Sherry with prune and other sweet fruit aromas. The palate is rich but has good flow, while dark flavors of dulce de leche and burnt brown sugar are wonderful. Sweet but balanced by mild coffee-like bitterness on the finish.",Solera 1847 Oloroso Dulce,91,18,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,González Byass
70616,Spain,"Serious, stately Rioja with key aromas of prune, blackberry and leather. Snappy enough on the palate, with plenty of pop as well as pure berry flavors, smooth tannins, zest and dry vanilla. Some might call it a bit acidic and traditional, but with food it'll do great. Drink now through 2016. Only 250 cases made.",El Belisario,91,80,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Agrícola Labastida
70621,Spain,"Fine aromas that announce balance and completeness draw you in, and right away you will like the cherry, red currant and cassis flavors. But as that fruit sits and the acidity builds, the wine goes racy initially and then almost haywire. By the end it almost falls off toward sour. Best right out of the bottle, and with food.",Crianza,85,14,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Castillo Labastida
70624,Spain,"As per usual, this wine carries a leafiness and peppery quality that runs ahead of its fruit quotient. That doesn't mean it's a poor wine; but it emphasizes dry oak and saucy flavors as opposed to richness and ripeness. Best for Rioja traditionalists and those who might drink it with robust foods.",Finca Monasterio,85,43,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Baron De Ley
70643,Spain,"Aromas of cherry sucking candy, sangria and citrus peel are easy and clean but not what you'd call sophisticated. The palate is forward and basic, with tangy cherry and plum skin flavors. It thickens a bit on the finish but always has a racy personality. Better with food due to grabby tannins and acids.",Reserva,85,25,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Ramón Bilbao
70648,Spain,"Seems like Solabal let its reserva-level grapes get a little too soft before picking. The wine has color and potential, but the nose is a little flat and syrupy. The palate delivers ripe dark fruit flavors but also a touch of medicinality. Balance can be fleeting and this wine doesn't have it all the way.",Reserva,85,23,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Solabal
70651,Spain,"A smooth and coaxing Sherry with almond and dried fruit aromas that lead perfectly to toffee and almond flavors. There's more dryness than fruit here, with peanut brittle accents and then a long, smoky finish that doesn't lose focus. Graceful Oloroso, with a nice individual character.",Cristina Oloroso Abacado,91,18,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,González Byass
70667,Spain,"This is nothing more than a few barrels of wine bottled by Hughes, a so-called “global vintner.” And like its Lot 128 brother, it is really good juice. Inky and floral, with blueberry and wild raspberry flavors. It's smooth, fresh, bold and finishes with mint and chocolate. Shows the positives of Campo de Borja's Garnacha.",Lot 129,90,15,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Cameron Hughes
70676,Spain,"Dry and smooth, with balsam and cedar aromas wrapped around controlled fruit scents and toast. The wine is ripe and balanced, with hickory flavors adding a barbecued angle to the steady palate. Firm, structured and tasting of clove and woodspice on the finish. Drink now through 2011.",Crianza,90,19,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Solabal
70689,Spain,"A standard but solid Tempranillo is what you're looking at. The nose pushes red fruit and some American oak aromas like pickle and dill. The feel is fresh and young, but also a little fleshy and substantive. Finishes friendly and smooth.",NA,85,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Darien
70696,Spain,"Perfectly nice, but ultimately basic in its approach. The nose is initally dry and woodsy, with plenty of balsam. Later on, the palate reveals a previously unseen black cherry element, while the finish is crisp and lean. Drink now.",NA,85,11,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
70703,Spain,The kick and acidic foundation of this crianza work in its favor. They balance some of the heavier elements and emphasize the berry core and also the finish. Is it narrow and limited? Yes. But it fits the traditional mold and doesn't disappoint.,Crianza,85,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,El Coto
70708,Spain,"Spicy and reedy in an old-fashioned way. This wine represents traditional Riojano winemaking: it's tight, acidic and endowed with racy rhubarb, raspberry and dill flavors. Pretty full and big on the palate, with touches of green herb and spice on the finish.",Reserva,85,19,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marqués de la Concordia
70713,Spain,"A fuller, more minty and deep Garnacha than Hughes' Lot 129. This has standup, standout aromas followed by deep berry fruit flavors. It has plenty of body but keeps its balance, and the finish is thick and strong. A little rugged but really good by regional standards.",Lot 128,90,15,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Cameron Hughes
70715,Spain,"A touch horsey at first, but with time it settles on saddle leather and earthy fruit. The palate is chunky and beefy, with some funk, chocolate and herbal black fruit. Not super spunky and lively, but dense as a brick and interesting. Drink now through 2014.",Torre Albéniz Reserva,90,50,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Finca Torremilanos
70724,Spain,"Ripe and attractive, with deep red fruit aromas. The palate is intense and thorough, with solid tannins supporting ripe, natural flavors of baked berries, particularly blackberry and dark plum. Subtle and smooth on the finish, with length. The blend is 50% Garnacha and 25% each Carignan and Cabernet Sauvignon. Drink now through 2013.",Castell de Falset,90,40,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Red Blend,Agricola Falset-Marca
70725,Spain,"A potent, concentrated sort of wine with minerally, crusty aromas, smoked meat and black fruit. The palate is deep and ripe, with pure, tasty, sweet flavors of mildly baked blackberry. Generous late, with mocha and toast on the finish. Best now through 2012.",Reserva,90,36,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Alidis
70730,Spain,"Bold, dark and handsome, albeit a touch herbal and earthy on the nose. The palate is thick and statuesque, with herbal, rooty berry fruit, a spot of raisin, and cracked black pepper. Chewy, deep and ultimately dry on the finish. Drinkable now; best in another couple of years.",Gran Reserva,90,53,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Prado Rey
70740,Spain,"CUNE is a throwback bodega whose wines won't appeal to followers of the new wave. And since I consider myself a backer of the modern style, I found this wine too obtuse, funky and borderline dirty to rate higher. It's full of mossy, stewy flavors and the feel is heavy. Traditionalist, however, may find it worthy of greater praise.",Imperial Gran Reserva,84,60,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,CVNE
70743,Spain,"This wine is not up there with the bodega's top bottlings. It's rather sweet and soft, with mildly green and minty aromas. In the mouth, there's size and power but also a strong medicinal overtone that dampens the fiesta. In the end it's big and fruity but there's no sense of path or purpose.",Crianza,84,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Consejo de la Alta
70744,Spain,"Lemon-lime and ginger ale are the opening aromas, while the palate carries green melon and passion fruit flavors. Not terribly intense or complex, with a cider-like spritz to the mouthfeel and finish.",NA,84,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Viura,El Coto
70757,Spain,"Vanilla, raisin and carob aromas announce a level of heft and overripeneness that is never lost or compensated for. It's a jammy, soft, well-aged specimen that doesn't have much life or kick. It does offer ripe, sweet berry flavors, however, and some molasses.",Gran Reserva,84,38,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Ramón Bilbao
70762,Spain,"Raisin, licorice and sawdust are the primary aromas, while the palate runs dry and slightly overdone with oak. It's a decent wine that's neither funky nor faulty; but it is dried out and lean, with apple skin and hard-spice flavors.",Crianza,84,19,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Marques de Tomares
70783,Spain,"An easygoing but nicely made Rioja that delivers purity, good fruit, body and feel. The nose is all cherry and berry, and it's a clear step up from your everyday red wine. The palate is medium bodied, with tasty, spicy flavors of cherry and raspberry. Lasting on the finish, with proper texture throughout.",Finca Vallobera,90,32,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Vallobera
70816,Spain,"Oak, cherry and raisin make for a warm bouquet, and there's initial weight to the palate. But then grabby tannins and cutting acidity take over, pushing the fruit toward zesty, even thin. A light and ready style, for certain.",Gran Familia,84,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Castillo de Fuenmayor
70832,Spain,"When in doubt, you can always trust Dry Sack. As always, this is a powerful, rich Sherry with burnt sugar and heavily toasted coffee and caramel flavors. It's no softie courtesy of heat and acidity, and at all points it mixes its sweet side with tough, roasted intensity. Great for cigar smokers.",Drysack Solera Especial Sweet Old Olorosso Aged 15 Years,90,25,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Williams & Humbert
70853,Spain,"Excellent Ribera crianza here. It has a smooth, appealing bouquet of candied berry fruit, which is followed by a rich palate of cassis, black cherry, prune, chocolate and coffee. For the price point this is right on the money; it's ripe but also really good and ready to drink.",Crianza,90,16,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Mayor
70869,Spain,"Red cherry, cough drop and a touch of mushroom work the nose, while in the mouth it's crisp and pointed, with light red fruit and citrus-influenced flavors. A lean, lithe wine very much in the pie cherry realm.",Crianza,84,11,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Montecillo
70870,Spain,"This semisweet white can come across likable or awful, depending on your mood and the shape of the bottle you're drinking. The sample we tried for this review was in perfect shape, and it showed tropical fruit and pineapple aromas in front of sugary mango and melon flavors.",Satinela Medium-Sweet,84,8,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Marqués de Cáceres
70884,Spain,"Roasted and woodsy on the nose, with a base scent of raisins. The palate pushes tight cherry flavors and a little citrus, while the feel is uncomplicated and light.",Primi,83,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Luis Gurpegui Muga
70922,Spain,"Right from the start you know this wine is challenged. The nose is lean and green, with hints of tea and citrus peel. In the mouth, it's snappy and traditional, meaning there's American oak dill notes brushing up against rhubarb and red cherry. Proponents will cite its “classic” character while others will call it thin and not very rewarding.",NA,83,11,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marqués de la Concordia
70926,Spain,"Spearmint and untamed wild berry aromas start it down a slope that ends with a palate that's hot and heavy with fruit but devoid of balance and touch. There's a lot of this and that, namely vanilla and oak. But overall the wine just gets it together.",Crianza,83,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Rioja Vega
70929,Spain,"Cheerful but basic raspberry aromas and flavors is what this young Rioja is about. It feels a little bulky at first, and then acids swell up to cut it short. Almost snappy in the late innings.",NA,83,8,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Rioja Vega
70931,Spain,"This wine is not typical of Allende. It suffered from the heat of 2003 and thus it's overtly aromatic in a prune-like way and out of balance on the palate. If it weren't for the unusual but intriguing molasses aromas and the occasional blast of quality berry fruit, we'd dismiss it outright. Better to wait for the 2004.",NA,83,27,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Finca Allende
70937,Spain,"An attempt at high-end Tempranillo that comes across rough and tough and not too friendly. The nose is rubbery and dark, while the palate is big and generic, with chocolate on the back end. But where this wine gets you is in feel: it's a tannic monster.",Finca los Meriños,83,60,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Luberri
70965,Spain,"Opens with rooty, mature aromas of tobacco, baked berry and raisin, while the palate is full and roasted, with sweet baked-plum and brown sugar flavors. Mature and ready to go, with head-to-toe sweetness and molasses accents. Not a hard, tannic wine. Drink now through 2012.",Montsalvat,89,79,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Francesc Sanchez Bas
70997,Spain,"Stewed fruit aromas with some baked beans on the side just isn't alluring, and the lean, raw, acidic palate that some might describe as traditional isn't clicking in my book. Saving graces include milk chocolate on the finish.",Reserva,82,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Baron De Ley
71002,Spain,"An earthy style with pickle barrel and leather on the nose. Dark berry flavors are muddled, and there's an odd twinge of citrus to the flavor profile. Never really gets it going and seems murky. Two samples tasted.",Don Roman,82,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marques de Tomares
71017,Spain,"A dry, oily, piquant Oloroso that's more peanutty than almondy. The palate is racy due to no shortage of acidity, and the flavor profile is led by a salty, briney almond and leather character. Sheer and serious, with not a sugar cube in sight.",Alfonso Oloroso Seco,89,18,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Palomino,González Byass
71033,Spain,"A bit heavy and raisiny, but with that said there's no denying the wine's richness and ripeness. Lush and dense in the mouth, with cocoa, roasted fruit and a mild syrupy lean to the flavor profile. Sweet but a little short on the finish, and condensed. Drink now through 2012.",Tinto Figuero 12 Crianza,89,29,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,García Figuero
71042,Spain,"Never let the price tag dictate perceived quality; you may be disappointed. This tart, choppy, clumsily extracted Tempranillo is a case in point. Where's the balance and mouthfeel? This is why we blind-taste; save your $350.",NA,81,354,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Contador
71053,Spain,"We are big fans of most Sierra Cantabria wines, but this fading, overoaked white Rioja is more or less a dud. It's weighed down by heavy, unintegrated wood notes and the finish is like chewing an oak branch. It's hard to see the point. 250 cases made.",Organza,80,24,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Sierra Cantabria
71057,Spain,". Stand up and take note: this is great wine from Priorat. And that's regardless of whether it is typically Priorato in style. It trades textbook minerality for lushness, and the fruit is star quality. In the mouth, there's an explosion of grape matter that leaves coffee, chocolate, peanut brittle and vanilla. Almost drinkable right now but best from 2009.",NA,96,85,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Vall Llach
71074,Spain,"Earthy and crusty at first, with smoked meat, black fruit and dryness to the nose. The palate is well formed and proper, with dry raspberry and mild chocolate flavors. Finishes peppery and solid, with the slightest herbal note. Very nice wine to drink now through 2014.",Gran Reserva,89,NA,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Pedrosa
71091,Spain,"A super sweet, potent brew that takes no prisoners as it hits with powerful toffee, caramel and alcohol aromas. Good in the mouth because it's not gritty, but very sweet on the palate, with honey, brown sugar and cinnamon flavors. If sweet is your thing, then add a point or two to our score.",Esnobista Moscatel Pasa,88,20,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L.
71097,Spain,"Having really liked this wine a couple of years ago, this vintage seems comparatively fierce and aggressive, which isn't to say it isn't hugely flavorful and aromatic. On the down side, it's residue-heavy and tannic, with full extraction and tannic berry fruit. Tough as nails; maybe it just needs a couple of years to settle.",NA,88,90,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Paixar
71098,Spain,"Opens with rich aromas of raisin, licorice, black plum and molasses that put it on the cusp of overripe. The palate is rich and gritty, with deep berry and molasses flavors. Generous for sure, but also slightly baked and sweet. Tastes like a warm-climate, warm-vintage wine. Drink now.",La Montesa,88,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Palacios Remondo
71099,Spain,"Raspberry and plum aromas carry a mild floral, perfumed accent, while the palate is medium in weight, with good flow due to lively acidity. Flavors of red fruits are equalized by oaky vanilla and dry herbs, while the finish is lengthy and snappy due to aforementioned core acidity.",Reserva,88,25,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Mayor
71104,Spain,"Deep and dark, this is an excellent kitchen-sink blend (it includes Carignan, Merlot, Cabernet, Garnacha and Syrah). For those who like expressive, fruity, no-holds-barred wines, you're gonna swoon for this. The palate is super lush and full of dark cherry, tobacco, herbs and spice, while the finish is mile-long. Outwardly impressive in a modern style.",Idus,93,55,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Vall Llach
71110,Spain,"Lovers of full-bodied, extracted Priorat wines know Vall Llach, and that cult sees Embruix as a good value. The 2004 is on the right track: the nose is almost impenetrable as it oozes blackberry, tar and fine leather. Meanwhile, the palate is like warm berry compote followed by espresso and dark chocolate. Very rich although not overly complex. Best now with steak or cheese, or hold until 2008.",Embruix,92,34,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Vall Llach
71113,Spain,"A barrel buster, with huge barrique qualities including char, chocolate and vanilla along with ripe black-fruit aromas. Spirited is the best way to describe this masculine, tannic bruiser, which is a blend of old-vines Garnacha and Carignan. Hold a couple of years to let it settle, then enjoy.",Amadis,92,60,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Rotllan Torra
71115,Spain,"Powerful is almost an understatement in describing this big boy. The nose starts out fiery and rough before settling to intense. It's all guns blazing on the palate, where tight, racy raspberry fruit holds court. With intense oak and a molten core generating 15.5% alcohol you may want to tread carefully. The ride is not for the weak. Garnacha with Carignan, Syrah and Cab Sauvignon.",Melis,92,90,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Cellers Melis
71128,Spain,"Carignan and Grenache lead the way on this old-vines classic that is typically excellent but not quite as generous, round and whole as in previous vintages. Still, you will be impressed by the compact nose of thyme, sage and tobacco along with dry red fruit. In addition, the palate of cassis and blackberry is pure and tannic as a rock. Needs time; best in 2009–10.",Les Eres Vinyes Velles,91,68,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Joan Simó
71135,Spain,"Radiator dust, baked apple and other familiar, semirich aromas grace the nose on this more elevated Cava. In the mouth, there's chunkiness, weight and integrity along with a flavor profile that hints at vinegar but settles on cidery apple and kumquat. Nicely done and different from the mass wines Freixenet is known for.",Elyssia Gran Cuvee Brut,88,18,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
71146,Spain,"Solid if a bit soupy and tomato-driven on the nose. In the mouth, there's a nice offset between herbal, red fruit characteristics, tobacco and black fruit. Overall, it's a gritty, tight, honest Ribera wine with a long, powerful finish. Just ripe enough, with indviduality and identity. Drink now through 2012.",Selección Crianza,88,18,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Fuentespina
71169,Spain,"One of the best efforts we've tried from Jumilla, Luzon's luxury blend starts with coconut, mint, char and fudge, and below that is a treasure trove of deep black fruit. Huge blackberry and black cherry flavors are potent as they ride on a wave of jolting tannins. An affordable shining star for a rising region.",Altos de Luzón,91,16,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Luzón
71171,Spain,"This younger-vines mix of Garnacha, Carignan, Cab Sauvignon and Syrah is very attractive and loaded with graphite, schisty mineral and black cherry aromas. The palate comes in waves, with the first delivering plum and berry and the second offering chocolate, herbs and lavender. Quite pretty and very tannic. Hold until 2008, if possible.",Les Sentius,91,35,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Joan Simó
71187,Spain,"Intense and deep, with plenty of licorice, leather and pepper encasing serious dark-berry aromas. The wine runs round and full in the mouth, with chewy berry flavors, meaty tannins and a generous finish that's long and just a touch lemony from the wine's 20 months in barrel. A wine that speaks to you.",AlfaSpiga,91,49,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,O. Fournier
71196,Spain,"A bit sweet and raisiny on the nose, but also dense and powerful. The palate runs rough and tannic, but there's enough richness and extract to allow for that. Flavors of cassis and raspberry are dark but snappy, while the finish has raisiny notes but also some edge. This one may improve with time; drink now through 2013.",Miros,88,19,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Peñafiel
71210,Spain,"Starts out a bit sweaty and leathery, but soon it turns more smoky. As a whole it's more bulky and barnyardy than most PX wines, with sweet prune and raisin flavors that seem a bit generic. Thick on the finish, with a gooey sweetness throughout.",Extra Rich,88,30,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Pedro Ximénez,Pedro Romero
71218,Spain,"Dusty, creamy, powdered sugar aromas are nice and easygoing, while the palate has balance and a mouthfeel that caresses solid apple, citrus and peach flavors. Crisp on the finish, with a decent amount of elegance for a $15 wine. Hard to go wrong with this bubbly.",Brut Reserva,88,15,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Vega Barcelona
71222,Spain,"You want color and heft? You get that here, and more. Dark, grapy aromas are lush more than rough and tight, while the palate is full of sassy black cherry fruit and a fair share of richness. No doubt this jam-packed blend of Garnacha, Merlot and Carignan is solid and rewarding. 250 cases produced.",Ecològic,91,39,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Genium Celler
71230,Spain,"From a brutally hot vintage, this shows plenty of mineral, schist and cola aromas along with impeccably smooth fruit. It's a little racy and sheer in the mouth, but food will balance that without a problem. And along the way you should enjoy the licorice, cherry, kirsch and other crafty nuances that this fine blend of Cabernet, Garnacha and Carignan has to offer. Drink now through 2009.",NA,91,42,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Red Blend,Mas de l'Abundància
71231,Spain,"Mildly sweet and candied, with accents of rose petal, red licorice and high-quality raisin. As always, it's an intense wine with red raspberry, cherry and plum flavors in front of finishing vanilla and butter. It's a bit grabby and tannic, but it seems to have harnessed correct ripeness in what was a difficult, hot year.",Clos de L'Obac,90,75,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Costers del Siurana
71232,Spain,"Waxy melon and apple aromas are intricate and welcoming, while the melon and citrus flavors are just as they should be. Do Ferreiro is a consistent high-end producer in Rias Baixas and its '05 Albariño is great. It picks up steam as it goes along and will go great with salads and seafood. Drink now.",NA,90,24,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Do Ferreiro
71236,Spain,"Here's a really good, young Mencia that is sure to win you over. The nose is fully ripe and loaded with pure berry aromas.

71240,Spain,"After a couple of rough years, all Fluminus needed was the good 2004 vintage. And the result is splendid. This blend of Cab, Garnacha and Carignan is pure as can be, with polished leather and fine tobacco aromas entering the fray. The whole is complete and big-boned, but in the end it's more tight and compact than plush. Give it two years to show its best side.",Flvminis,90,28,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Red Blend,Mas de l'Abundància
71249,Spain,"Rustic fruit aromas led by the native Samso grape cause a stir, and the wine, which also has Garnacha, Cabernet and Merlot, carries forth in the mouth, where lush blackberry and plum flavors are supported by healthy, spicy, minty oak. With tight tannins and comfortable acidity, it will drink better in a few years. Imported by Bernard Magrez.",Herència del Padrí,90,75,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Bernard Magrez
71260,Spain,"Dense and spicy on the nose, with tobacco, baked fruit aromas and dry, woody notes. It's a fairly rich, slick and generous Rioja with lightly baked berry fruit flavors, spice cake accents and limited complexity. Solid on the finish, with additional spice notes. Drink now through 2013.",Finca Monasterio,88,45,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Baron De Ley
71264,Spain,"A touch gritty and baked on the nose, and that ripe character persists throughout this semimodern Ribera wine. Along the route there's raisiny notes, baked plum flavors and oak-driven vanilla and spice. On the finish, vanilla is the lasting flavor. Solid and oaky, with some pushy coconut.",Reserva,88,24,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Valdubón
71265,Spain,"Clean and vibrant, with citrus blossom and apple aromas. The palate is a bit neutral in flavor but shows good cut and a cleansing feel along with tastes of spiced apple and white nectarine. Finishes clean and pure. Drink now.",NA,88,15,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Viña Bade
71293,Spain,"Sweet, succulent aromas draw you in and while the wine doesn't deliver much nuance on either the nose or palate, we can't quibble with the power, purity and intensity of the blackberry fruit. It's young, tannic and tough now, so give it two years and it should be an excellent wine.",NA,90,47,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo,Mauro
71324,Spain,"Sweet and welcoming; a good deal among pedigreed red wines. The nose on this 100% Monastrell from older vines is mammoth, toasty and dark, while the palate is chunky and virtually melts with blackberry, plum and cherry flavors. A real-deal red with breadth and class. 1,000 cases made.",NA,90,16,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Juan Gil
71337,Spain,"This muscular youth proves that Priorat can deliver fleshy, modern wines. Or maybe it's the 20% Merlot that's softenening the Garnacha and Carignan. Either way, look for lush plum and black cherry flavors floating on a rich, heady palate. This is more Escalade or Range Rover than sports car.",NA,89,32,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Genium Celler
71338,Spain,"Very nice apple blossom and lightly stony aromas greet you, and the apple and apricot flavors are juicy and ripe.

71340,Spain,"Big and yellow, which is evidence of the oak aging on this plump, modern Verdejo that's made in small quantity and will appeal to those who like things such as Sémillon and Chenin Blanc. The body is full, there's fruit, weight and grip, and the ripeness versus minerality is just right. Drink now with cheese or fish. 300 cases produced.",Naiades,89,28,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Naia
71353,Spain,"Dry, smoky and lightly fruity, this Pinot Noir-based Cava is about as good as it gets in the price range. The nose delivers distant brown sugar and burnt leaves, while the palate lays on the orange rind, peach and cherry skin flavors. Try this classy sparkler; you won't be disappointed.",Rosé Brut Reserva,89,15,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Marqués de Gelida
71373,Spain,"Spicy and savory smelling, with interesting aromas that encompass maple, chili powder, smoked meat and mildly baked berries. The palate is round and a little rough in the tannic category. But overall this wine is exceedingly pleasant, well made and pretty much ready to drink now.",Gran Abadia Mediterrània,89,65,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Costers del Priorat
71388,Spain,"If you don't mind some heavy barrel char, then you'll probably like this rough rider. It has espresso and asphalt on the nose, and then you get leathery plum and berry fruit on the palate. A good wine, with a long finish, lots of oak and overall balance. In a nutshell, there's plenty going on.",Valdunes,89,20,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Tierra Adentro
71393,Spain,"Not often do you come across an aged Valdepeñas red, especially one with style, structure and character. The nose of dried fruits and spices also features cigar box and tomato, while the palate of red plum, cherry and tomato is mature.

71395,Spain,"Scala Dei seems to have managed 2003's tough conditions, and this is endowed with sweet Garnacha-driven aromas that touch up against raisiny but don't cross the line. The palate is plump and loaded with strawberry and vanilla flavors, then chocolate shows up on the finish. The blend is 41% Garnacha, 41% Syrah and 18% Cab Sauvignon.",Cartoixa,89,36,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Scala Dei
71416,Spain,"Plenty of intense new oak sets the nose in a direction toward mint, licorice and black pepper. And that's all good, because the palate backs it up  with prime blackberry and cassis flavors. This is a solid wine with slightly pronounced acids and tannins. Not for those averse to a little grab and kick.",Prios Maximus Crianza,88,26,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas de los Rios Prieto
71421,Spain,"Nicely balanced and a better example of the upside of Navarra than the wines that are based on or include Merlot. The nose shows some herbal character but more deep fruit notes. And in the mouth there's ripe cherry, cassis and plum. Texturally, it's very nice, and when you get down to the nuts and olts it's a very good value.",NA,88,11,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon-Tempranillo,Vega Sindoa
71427,Spain,"Carchelo is at its best in this vintage. This is loaded with wild blackberry and leathery sass, too.

71434,Spain,"Toasty, yeasty and quite composed given the price point. If you like green apples, ripe pears or lychee fruit, chances are you're going to like this well-blended and fairly smooth Cava. It's persistent and structured enough to go with appetizers or main courses.",Brut Exclusive Reserva,88,13,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Marqués de Gelida
71442,Spain,"Raspberry and a touch of citrus peel make for a light, appealing nose, while the red cherry and red apple skin flavors are cheerful, bouncy and attractive.

71450,Spain,"Rarely do you find musclebound, intense reds priced at $8 that are this good. But Luzon manages to give you a 65/35 blend of Monastrell and Syrah that is lively, loaded and eminently likable. It's all about hefty black fruit, bold tannins and flash. Only 5,000 cases made.",NA,88,8,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Luzón
71454,Spain,"Brutal heat didn't do a lot for Mas La Plana in 2003. While still a worthy wine, this one shows some green on the nose and palate, while the balance is weightier than normal. In its favor, there's bold blackberry and a touch of cola on the palate. Good but not up to the wine's usual high standards.",Mas La Plana,88,50,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon,Torres
71460,Spain,"Generally speaking, this is a respectable Priorat from a tough year. The nose is berry packed, while the flavors run toward toast-covered raspberry. It's typically grabby and expansive, as any good young wine from the area will be, yet you can drink it now with meat.",Miserere,88,68,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Costers del Siurana
71501,Spain,"There's not much difference between this wine and the label's less expensive Brandal. This is a bit richer, with chunky melon aromas and peach melba flavors. But it may suffer a bit from additional ripeness and lower acidity. For best results, get at it fast.",NA,87,25,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Adegas D'Altamira
71509,Spain,"A little weighty, with ripe apple and peach aromas. Fairly succulent in the mouth, with apple and citrus flavors that are both sweet and a touch chewy. Some pith on the finish adds complexity and overall you can't knock the wine's character. Drink now.",Brandal,87,15,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Adegas D'Altamira
71512,Spain,"In 2005 this winery got a great harvest, and it's evident in this ripe, clean Garnacha that hits with jammy aromas and a ton of fresh-fruit flavors. Juicy, smooth and earnest is how to describe this tasty bargain from a region that doesn't always shine this bright.",Tinto,87,8,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Coto de Hayas
71518,Spain,"Heat from the 2003 vintage aside, this is one sweet, forward, dark-colored Cava. The nose is all about cheeky, sweet fruit, while the palate offers more berry sweetness along with vanilla. Normally this bottling is more restrained and striated, but 2003 was a warm year. May be better with desserts than appetizers, given the ripeness.",Rosé Brut Reserva,87,18,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Llopart
71520,Spain,"Nothing wrong with this pleasant, friendly Cava. The nose boasts frosted breakfast cereal and lemon curd, while the palate is defined by spiced apple and baked citrus. It gets more honeyed and fat as it opens, although a good chilling will keep that in check.",Masia Parera Brut,87,11,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Sparkling Blend,Giró Ribot
71521,Spain,"Nice and fruity, with a touch of spice to the nose. The palate is plump and dark, with nothing besides all-natural fruit. A hearty and healthy wine that boasts freshness and purity but no oak.",NA,87,12,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Gotin
71529,Spain,"Fairly bold and ripe up front, with dark berry aromas and an almond candy undercurrent. The palate is a bit more red-fruit based than the bouquet, and the flavors of raspberry and red plums are satisfying a touch tangy. Interesting, with drying tannins on the finish.",NA,87,18,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Val Montium
71538,Spain,"Classic in every sense, from the early aromas of dill butter to the dry, acid-driven palate to the light, crisp finish. In a world where so many wines are going ripe and heavy, this one holds steady to the traditional. So if you're looking for an old-school Spanish red to go with tortilla espanola or lamb chops, this will do the trick.",Old Vines Reserva,87,17,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Navarro López
71549,Spain,"Light and floral on the nose, and medium in intensity and acidity. Flavors of apple, green melon and citrus are clean and crisp, and overall the wine is a model of freshness. Drink it sooner rather than later; it's a touch on the soft side.",Casamaro,87,10,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Garciarévalo
71562,Spain,"With its black plum, blackberry and other bold, juvenile aromas, this bargain-priced Spaniard shows flavors of chocolate, natural bitterness and good overall balance. A little big and brawny, but better than washed out and weak. A classic chorizo or hamburger wine.",Protocolo Tinto,86,6,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Dominio de Eguren
71565,Spain,"Moderately dark and dense, but hardly brooding and deep. This is a nice, zesty version of Mencia that highlights the grape's cherry and raspberry character. It's flush and features good fruit-to-acid balance.",Pucho,86,15,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Herederos de Martínez Fuente
71569,Spain,"No doubt this wine possesses peppery, herbal qualities. But before it's dismissed as green we'd like to note that there's also a nice savory side to it. More herbal than vegetal, and with decent balance. With food this wine will do just fine; on its own it may seem a touch reedy and rough.",Prior,86,25,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Scala Dei
71575,Spain,"Plump, melony and ripe on the nose, with creamy pear, melon and banana flavors. Normally this wine is more racy and acidic than this, but the '05 seems tropical relative to previous years. Still, it's a good wine that will go down nicely if properly chilled. Drink now.",NA,86,15,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Martinsancho
71578,Spain,"The Eguren brothers of Sierra Cantabria and other projects always do a nice job with this Tempranillo from central Spain. It's a no-frills, bulky red with rich fruit and bacon aromas backed by bold boysenberry and blackberry flavors. There's no shortage of voltage in this tight, jabby, slightly clumsy red.",Codice,86,9,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Dominio de Eguren
71584,Spain,"This Cabernet-Tempranillo blend is even-keeled and solid from start to finish.

71586,Spain,"It's already too late for an '04 Albariño, but this one still has some life and kick in it. The nose has some peanut and lacquer, but overall apple aromas ride high.

71600,Spain,"This Cab-Merlot blend delivers nice tobacco, char and dark fruit aromas, which are backed by plum, blackberry and chocolate flavors.

71625,Spain,"Opens with aromas of tobacco and dried leaves as well as plum and cherry, and that's backed by raspberry, plum and cherry tomato flavors. For an older wine, it's showing life, acidity and some old-school style. What it doesn't have are any of those New World characteristics, i.e. black fruit, chocolate and weight.",Gran Reserva,86,14,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Laguna de la Nava
71629,Spain,"There is much to like about this wine, particularly the cola and roasted fruit flavors that control the palate. But in front and back of that likable intermezzo is a sharp, prickly bouquet and a mouthfeel that's slightly grabby, tannic and elastic. Good but you want it to be better. Drink now.",NA,86,46,Northern Spain,Cigales,NA,Tinto del Pais,Traslanzas

71681,Spain,"Bring on the funk, at least at first. This new-to-America wine gets out of the gate with wild leather, stable and bramble aromas, and there's always an aggressive, untamed quality to it.

71714,Spain,"Vanilla and dill aromas are front and center. The palate imparts plum skin and red-apple flavors, with lots of rough tannins holding the feel hostage.

71729,Spain,"An older wine with more oak than jazzy fruit, so the aromas are heavy with the scent of cinnamon and the palate is more drying and spicy than it is rich and rewarding.

71759,Spain,"Interesting in that this fresh, snappy table wine includes 60% Airen (a white grape) in addition to Tempranillo.

71796,Spain,"Already past its prime, this Garnacha-based rosado has sweet nectarine aromas along with a sugary, creamy palate. If it had more zest upon release, that's mostly gone at this stage. Wait for the 2006.",Rosé,82,7,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Borsao
71798,Spain,"Campo de Borja can produce some strange wines, and at the head of the class would be this rooty, tomato-laden wine that's at one point sweet but then bland and cooked at the next. A varietal Garnacha from a hot vintage that just isn't worth the price.",NA,82,43,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Alto Moncayo
71803,Spain,"Burnt and seemingly weedy at first, this heavily oaked 100% Garnacha is initially downright weird and baked. In the final analysis it's all wood and medicinal fruit. Not a personal favorite.",Veraton,82,22,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Alto Moncayo
71807,Spain,"Initial sweet-plum aromas are as good as it gets. Raisin enters the picture, and eventually you've got a  heavy, clumsy, overly ripe wine that tastes and smells mostly of sappy oak and coconut.",Number One,82,8,Central Spain,Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Berberana
71809,Spain,"Cloudy red in color, with musky berry aromas. The palate shows some cherry and raspberry, while the feel is sort of rough. A classic country wine that isn't about to rock anyone's world.",NA,82,10,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,NA,Tempranillo,Montecruz
71810,Spain,"No matter how you slice this up, it comes out smelling and tasting sharp and burnt. The nose is brambly and fiery, while the mouth is peppery and rough. Hard and jagged at every turn, thus you need the pan y arroz (bread and rice), to absorb the wine's kick.",Red,82,10,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Panarroz
71811,Spain,"Prune and other overweight aromas carry the nose, and the palate is raisiny. Not rough by any means, but a lot of dead weight drags it down.",Man Quixot,81,13,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas López Panach
71816,Spain,"Heavy and quite herbal, with strong tomato and molasses flavors. The feel of this wine is chunky and broad, yet the edges are sheer and sharp.

71818,Spain,"This is over the hill and showing mostly vegetal papaya and green melon aromas and flavors. There's not much spunk or style left, so wait for the 2006 and drink that wine upon release; Fransola has never aged well.",Fransola,81,27,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Sauvignon Blanc,Torres

Dry, mellow and ultimately short on the finish.",Mas Suau Brut Nature,86,15,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Ferré I Catasús
71917,Spain,"Smoky and roasted on the nose, it also has standard red-berry aromas lurking in the background.

72013,Spain,"This is one dark, intense Ribera del Duero with loads of lush black-fruit aromas matched against minerality and fine French-oak scents.

72027,Spain,"This is every bit as good as the winery's Clave de Tábula, which costs twice as much. An aromatic opening of fig, prune and blackberry comes with graphite, cola and attractive oak notes. This is intense and shows powerful acidity in support of blackberry, toast and dark, spicy flavors. A medium-long finish with toast and licorice is proper and not overdone.

A reasonably long finish deals flavors of mint and toast.",NA,87,9,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Rioja Vega
72094,Spain,"Dark plum and berry aromas hit with oomph and are accented by toasty, minerally notes. This Mencía is balanced and nicely textured, with blackberry, prune and licorice flavors.

72121,Spain,"Smells clean as a mountain stream, with apple, peach and mellow citric aromas. Shows medium intensity and controlled citrusy acids along with grapefruit, pineapple and passion fruit flavors that come largely from the 20% Sauvignon Blanc in the blend; the rest is 70% Chardonnay and 10% the local Picapoll grape.

72146,Spain,"Opens with waxy, sweet aromas of yellow apples and honey. Feels good, round and balanced, with Golden Delicious apple flavors sweetened by honey drippings and melon.

Drink now through 2018.",Clos Galena,91,55,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Domini de la Cartoixa
73202,Spain,"Heavy, raisiny aromas carry heat and a whiff of vinegar. In the mouth, this is thick and almost syrupy. Earthy flavors of blackberry, raisin and prune finish chewy but flat.

Drink now–2020.",Real Reserva,91,50,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Red Blend,El Coto
73525,Spain,"Gramona is known for yeasty, complex sparklers, and this falls into that paradigm. The nose is definitely yeasty, with apple and green melon aromas. It's a bit soft for Cava, but that's because it's an '05 that rested on lees for years. Flavors of toasted bread and apple are long on complexity and short on fruit, but once again that's what distinguishes Gramona from the masses.",III Lustros Gran Reserva,91,45,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Gramona

Dryness persists onto the finish, which is friendly but modest.",NA,85,8,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Rosé,Borsao
73564,Spain,"This is floral on the nose, but also candied smelling.

That said, this jellybean is an easy drinker.",Berry Smooth,85,13,Catalonia,Catalunya,NA,Red Blend,Jellybean Wines
73566,Spain,"Dusty aromas of apple and vanilla break up fast as the wine shows oxidized notes.

The finish is grating and slightly bitter.",Rojo Granrojo,82,9,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Navarro López

74106,Spain,"Earthy plum and berry aromas dominate a fruit-forward bouquet. A layered, proper feeling palate delivers lightly buttered flavors of dark plum, creamy oak and spice.

74107,Spain,"Full blackberry and black-plum flavors come across lush but soft. That impression is confirmed in the mouth, where things feel short on acidity and thus kind of flat and mushy. Blueberry and dark plum are the lead flavors, while the low-pulse finish feels heavy.",NA,86,NA,Northern Spain,Valdeorras,NA,Mencía,Gaba do Xil
74113,Spain,"Red plum and raspberry aromas come with a distinct whiff of stalks and stems. Big, grabby tannins control the mouthfeel, while baked flavors of herbal fruits finish with mossy notes and additional herbal overtones. This wine has its good points but it's undeniably scratchy and stemmy.",Gran Colegiata Campus,86,45,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Bodegas Fariña
74114,Spain,"This 10-year-old wine from a hot vintage is soft and plump but has gaps in its fiber. The mouth is tannic around the edges but lacks stuffing, while flavors of plum and berry run jammy and heavy.

74117,Spain,"Mild white-fruit and pickled aromas are O.K. but don't amount to a whole lot. This is a spritzy wine with tang and acidity, and citrusy pineapple, lemon and lime flavors.

74121,Spain,"Nectarine and orange peel are the lead aromas on this everyday, entirely serviceable Cava. A fresh, juicy, citrusy mouthfeel creates a nest for citrus flavors, grapefruit and orange in particular, to do their thing before finishing slightly bitter and pithy. This is made mostly from Trepat grapes.",Brut Rosé,86,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
74126,Spain,"Despite being fairly young, this is a weighty wine with a gold color and waxy apple aromas. A blocky mouthfeel is oily and has enough acidity to stay lively.

74141,Spain,"Fresh berry and plum aromas come with earth and herbal accents, which only boost the bouquet's complexity.

Drink through 2016.",NA,90,17,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Red Blend,Can Blau
74162,Spain,"Apple and mild spice aromas kick off this simple white from the land of red Garnacha.

This is a midlevel wine without much distinguishing character.",NA,84,17,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Chardonnay,Finca Albret
74174,Spain,"There's something likable about this aged, Sherry-style Rioja. Don't let the maderized tint turn you off; the wine has character, including rancio, toffee and saline aromas and flavors.

74186,Spain,"Gold in color, this Cava displays a distinct aroma of arugula or lettuce along with cream soda.

74236,Spain,"After an aromatic opening that includes wet leather, rubber and brine, this wine finds its stride, and while it's firmly tannic, the flavors of dark fruits, tomato, herbs, tobacco and cured meats do the trick.

74352,Spain,"Hard-packed plum and berry aromas come with an oaky, meaty component that's manifested in the mouth via oaky flavors and a resiny feel.

74361,Spain,"Gasssy, soda-like aromas are the greeting, however there are decent red-fruit scents in the backdrop.

74438,Spain,"Like many Griñon wines, this is dense and earthy on the nose, with ripe berry and marzipan aromas. A round, layered, full-bodied palate shows hard, unresolved tannins and ripe, earthy flavors of blackberry, spice, herbs and chocolate.

Drink through 2018.",Single Vineyard Estate Bottled,90,40,Central Spain,Dominio de Valdepusa,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon,Marques de Griñon
74439,Spain,"This is a very nice aged Rioja with baked, earthy aromas of spice along with dried raspberry and plum.

Drink now.",Gran Reserva,90,33,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marqués de Vitoria
74491,Spain,"Forget the high price on this Tempranillo Blanco. Looking at the wine alone, it's briny and stalky on the nose, with wiry lemon-like acids that push sour orange flavors.

74494,Spain,"This is herbal and tomatoey on the nose, then racy in feel, with little midlevel stuffing on the palate. Flavors of raspberry are dilute and offset by mild buttery oak notes. This wine shows some elements of classic Spain but weaknesses as well.",Old Vines Gran Reserva,83,19,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Navarro López
74495,Spain,"Maderized in color, this wine has a yeasty, creamy nose with baked white-fruit aromas and caramel. It's OK in feel, with pickled, mildly briny flavors of apple and apricot. The finish is showing some oxidization, leading to a chunky, fleshy feel.",Inspiración,83,40,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blanco,Bodegas Valdemar
74499,Spain,"The nose on this Viura is flat, with walnut oil and dusty apple notes. The mouthfeel is solid, while the flavors suggest dry apricot, apple and nutty notes. This is dry and modest on the finish.",NA,83,11,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Viura,Taron

74506,Spain,"This is a prickly, slightly raspy wine with a lean, grabby feel and briny, pickled flavors of herbal red-berry fruits. It's resiny tasting on the finish, with a snappy feel and lasting herbal flavors.",Tinto,83,8,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Garnacha,Chispas
74510,Spain,"This 50-50 blend of Garnacha and Tempranillo has a green, ashy sway to the nose.

74518,Spain,"This Cava has a funky nose that's unusual. The palate is a bit flabby, with sweet banana and peachy flavors. There's not much to the finish and overall this comes across as overly simple and strained.",Brut,83,13,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Paul Cheneau
74536,Spain,"Dark in color, with concentrated, jammy aromas of wild berry and plum.

Short but stout on the finish.",NA,86,7,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,Campos Reales
74537,Spain,"Light and a little scratchy on the bouquet, with leathery notes. Feels fresh and kind of light in weight, with basic but clean red-fruit flavors and a dash of peppery spice.

Contains 10% each Merlot and Cabernet.",Miros,86,13,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Peñafiel
74582,Spain,"What makes this varietal Syrah score high is not that it's over the top, superlush or heavily oaked, but that it's balanced to a tee. Black cherry, blackberry and spice aromas are more solid than they are special, while the palate folds together flavors of baked fruit, berry, mocha and tobacco. It doesn't expand much on the finish, but by then the story has been told.",Hacienda Zorita Natural Reserve Unamuno Vineyard,90,25,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Syrah,Marqués de la Concordia
74589,Spain,"This is intense for Garnacha, with piercing berry, spice and heat to the bouquet. This is a big, burly type of modern Garnacha, with a streak of boosting acidity.

74609,Spain,"A bit earthy and horsey on the nose, this is nevertheless attractive on the bouquet, with sandalwood, spice and black fruit aromas.

74705,Spain,"Albariño is a fragile style of white wine and some just don't age well. This is one of those wines; it's slightly past peak maturity, as evidenced by wheaty, yeasty aromas. The palate finishes with a hint of bitter citrus pith.",NA,85,34,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Lusco
74726,Spain,"Aromas of chemical, plastic and milk chocolate are dominant and mask the wine's black-fruit content. The palate feels condensed and narrow, while woody, baked flavors of berry fruits finish resiny and chocolaty.",JME,85,25,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Muriel
74727,Spain,"After opening with reedy, stalky aromas, this is raw and choppy on the palate. Flavors of herbal red plum and rhubarb conclude with tight, edgy acids and a bit of burn and heat. This is fresh and generally pretty good, but it lacks Toro's usual richness and power.",Crianza,85,25,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Damalisco
74761,Spain,"Given the difficulties of this cool vintage, this is an excellent wine with dark berry, herb, spice and vanilla aromas.

74763,Spain,"Teso la Monja picked a good vintage to introduce this entry-level Toro. Romanico is big and candied on the nose, with floral berry aromas, milk chocolate and a touch of raisin.

74777,Spain,"This has a lot of good things going in its favor, for example depth, power and richness. It's also raisiny and oaky, with stewy core flavors of baked berry, cassis, roasted meat and vanilla. The finish is chewy and thick, with vanilla and pastry flavors along with grating tannins. By no means is this wine perfect, but it offers a lot of what's good about Toro; drink now.",La Calera,90,34,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Cyan
74797,Spain,"Gritty, piercing aromas of herbal, leafy red fruits do little to set this wine on course. In the mouth, it's high-toned and acidic, and thus the flavors are tart, choppy and short.",NA,82,11,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Sinfonía

74802,Spain,"This is one unusual wine. It's a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon with Tempranillo and Garnacha, but it smells like a root-based perfume mixed with herbs and tobacco. It's over the hill in feel and green and herbal in flavor, with a raisiny aftertaste.",Jaloco,82,30,Central Spain,Extremadura,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Medina
74806,Spain,"Oxidized citrus aromas are flabby, as is the palate. Flavors of apple and peach are basic, while the finish feels dull and dried out, with no kick or lasting flavor other than mild bitterness.",NA,82,19,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Valtea
74807,Spain,"Peach and melon aromas come with accents of vanilla and honey. The palate on this Garancha Blanca is chunky, without much acidic cut.

74810,Spain,"A big step down from the past two vintages. This Verdejo lacks fortitude and clarity; it's grassy and flat on the nose, then cloying on the palate. Flavors of bland citrus are disjointed and underwhelming. Finishes grassy and green.",NA,82,10,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Cantarranas

74823,Spain,"Seems as though this medium-sweet Viura-Malvasia blend has gotten better in recent years as the winery has dialed down the sweetness and weight.

75071,Spain,"This wine is fresh as can be, with loads of friendly black-fruit aromas upfront.

75085,Spain,"For Toro, this is earthy and slightly herbal as opposed to ripe and jammy. Aromas of mulch, leather and herbal berry lead into a firm, rocky palate with rooty flavors of burnt leaves, black fruits and oregano. A tight, compact finish with moderate flavors is a bit closed and hard.",NA,89,28,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Elias Mora

75097,Spain,"Pazo Señorans generally makes great wine, but this aged Albariño is past its prime.

Carob and herbal notes are the finishing flavors.",Reserva Single Vineyard,85,30,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Red Blend,Ochoa
75320,Spain,"Tropical fruit aromas give this Verdejo a punchbowl bouquet that includes lychee and kiwi. The palate is melony and round in feel, with flavors of mango, honeydew and green banana.

75363,Spain,"Boysenberry and blueberry aromas mixed with oak scents amount to an inviting, solid bouquet. In the mouth, this is healthy, full-bodied and showing plenty of kick.

75370,Spain,"Exotic blueberry and fir tree aromas set up a jammy palate with soft tannins and flavors of blackberry, dark cherry, toast and a hint of burnt beef.

75385,Spain,"Light peach, apricot and buttercup aromas are better at first but lose steam with airing. This Xarello is lemony, racy and gives off plenty of kick on the palate, while flavors of citrus and melon are equally creamy and zesty. This holds firm on the finish, with brightness offset by a creamy texture.",NA,89,36,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Xarel-lo,Cellars Avgvstvs Forvm
75509,Spain,"This is jammy and reduced throughout, especially on the nose, which offers a dense blueberry aroma.

75662,Spain,"This big, dark, rubbery smelling Ribera wine is rugged and pushy, with mild volatility on the nose along with a whiff of spent coffee grinds. A clampy, bullish palate with rock-hard tannins sets up rubbery black-fruit flavors in front of a rough and tumble finish. Overall this is very good but hard and tannic.

75950,Spain,"Candied plum and cherry aromas are bright, jumpy and youthful. The mouthfeel on this red Rueda, something you don't normally see much of, is narrow, pinched and grabby.

But there's also a smooth intersection of the old and new worlds here; it's one part rooty, oaky and rich but also dry, leathery and indigenous to the Balearics (the base grape is Callet).

78131,Spain,"Comes out of the chute with some aggression, but that's settled by quality apple and grassy aromas. The palate is jumpy and lively, with pleasant, slightly sweet apple and peach flavors.

82740,Spain,"This Garnacha is another from the Borsao operations, and it's clean with plenty of black fruit on the nose and palate. Juicy, tight, forward stuff with a dark and peppery finish.

82752,Spain,"Rubbery and dark on the nose, with lots of black plum and cherry to ponder. The palate is firm and balanced, with round, rubbery, roasted plum and dark berry flavors.

82753,Spain,"Shiny pink in color, with a crisp and wet nose that powerfully suggests refreshment to come. Juicy and superfresh on the palate, with cherry and raspberry flavors and citrusy undertones. A real winner in Garnacha rosé from Navarra.",Garnacha,87,8,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Rosé,Vega Sindoa
82764,Spain,"Neutral smelling except for a touch of oiliness and tropical fruit. The palate is soft and melony, with sweet melon and papaya flavors. Round and pulpy on the finish, with a slight pithy bitterness at the very end.",NA,87,22,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Alvinte
82769,Spain,"Mineral, earth and graphite aromas give this rugged young Ribera complexity to go with racing berry fruit. The palate is a bit sharp and pounding, with boysenberry flavors coming with tannic bite and zest.

The finish is dry and snappy, with mild oak and spice flavors.",Soplo,88,18,Levante,Valencia,NA,Garnacha,Rafael Cambra
82793,Spain,"Jammy strawberry, crushed raspberry and mineral aromas define the bouquet. The palate is lifted by good acidity, while flavors of vanilla and tomato accent the raspberry and plum fruits.

82879,Spain,"Ripe and meaty, with bacon, earth, leather and inviting black fruit aromas. Not lazy at all; in fact a laser-like beam of acidity cuts through the palate, pushing bright, slightly fierce flavors of savory berry and minty oak. Finishes hot, spicy and with coffee and mocha. Cabernet-Monastrell to drink now through 2014.",Portú,92,69,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Luzón

Solid on the finish, with papaya for flavor.",NA,84,8,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Viura-Chardonnay,Vega Sindoa
82955,Spain,"Spearmint chewing gum, cassis and raisin aromas are friendly. However, on the palate this wine rings hollow, with little structure and hardly any midpalate.

Fresh and mild as a whole.",Finca Constancia,84,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Altozano
82963,Spain,"White fruit and flower aromas are friendly and simple. The palate feels soft and syrupy, and thus it's not surprising that the wine's flavors of sweet apple and pear taste honeyed and candied. Creamy on the finish, lacking the zest and cut that Verdejo should have.",Lunares Old Vines,84,10,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Lo Nuevo

83188,Spain,"This Cabernet-Monastrell blend tips the scales at 15.5% and asks you straight out: how big do you like your red wines? It is smoky, sultry and massive, with spicy boysenberry aromas, a deep, syrupy palate and plodding flavors of molasses, roasted berry, cedar plank and herbs. Bullish but drinkble now and over the next few years; probably not one for the cellar.",NA,92,140,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,El Nido
83220,Spain,"If this Cava weren't so pickled in smell and taste, it would rate better. As is, it opens with white fruit, vanilla and brine aromas.

83234,Spain,"Pungent on the nose, this offers blasts of nettle, sweat, mineral and stone along with citrus.

83254,Spain,"Starts out murky, gassy and challenged, and while it does emerge from that cloud it remains little more than bargain-priced, borderline Tempranillo from an obscure central Spain region.

83258,Spain,"Bright and shimmers with purple, while the nose is jumpy and candied, with a lot of sweetness and black fruit.

83263,Spain,"Generally speaking, most Amontillados are good at their worst, but for whatever reason this wine barely makes the grade. It lacks pop on the nose and seems dilute and drab.

83277,Spain,"Strawberry and rhubarb aromas get it going, and frankly that's about as good as it gets. The mouthfeel is so-so. but the flavors are funky and mealy, with a weedy bitterness that doesn't serve the wine well. Lacks purity, focus and persistence. Made from Pinot Noir.",Aria Brut,82,14,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Pinot Noir,Segura Viudas
83278,Spain,"A strange bird with herbaceous aromas that suggest sage or juniper baking in the summer sun. The palate is acidic and sharp, with green-tinged pie cherry and plum skin flavors.

83331,Spain,"Earthy tobacco and natural warmth provide for a good nose. It's briary smelling as well, with racy cherry and plum flavors.

83380,Spain,"This is light, mildly yeasty, slightly pickled and briny smelling. It feels fresh and edgy, with good acidic cut, while the flavors lean toward orange and white peach.

83381,Spain,"Harmonious on the bouquet, this has aromas of berry, marzipan and nutmeg. It feels a little acidic but that adds freshness to the package.

83465,Spain,"Dark as night and full of black fruit aromas, this old-vines newbie is rocking it. The nose is packed with jammy blackberry, leather and fine spice aromas, and the palate is pillowy despite big tannins.

83520,Spain,"Gold in color and short on bubbles, but heavy on sweetness and residual sugar. That said, it's an advertised semidry, so a certain level of cloy is expected.

83521,Spain,"Reddish in color and devoid of a visible bubble bead, this Garnacha-Monastrell cava is lacking in many ways.

Sweet cherry and plum flavors mix with snappy acidity and good structure, and overall you get a refreshing, satisfying wine with genuine appeal.",Protocolo,86,7,Central Spain,Tierra de Castilla,NA,Red Blend,Dominio de Eguren
86347,Spain,"Rich and very good, with depth and a chocolaty essence that shows itself on the front and back ends of the wine. Pure in terms of berry fruit flavors, and with good verve and mouthfeel. A balanced, spot-on wine with serious structure, style and follow through. Drink now–2015.",Reserva,90,40,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Felix Callejo
86348,Spain,"Earthy, rich and black as night, with roasted blackberry aromas that draw you in. Then the palate keeps you there, and even if it runs a bit hard and tannic, the integrity and flavors of coconut, roasted berry and coffee are fine and dandy. Boisterous and big, but that's Toro for you.",Seleccion Especial,90,35,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Finca Sobreño
86350,Spain,"A rich, more modern type of Rioja with dark color, slightly raisiny berry aromas and molasses, vanilla and mocha on the nose. The palate is full and chewy, with cola, fig and wild berry flavors. Stylish and creamy on the finish, and very pleasant as a whole. 55% Tempranillo with four other grapes blended in, including Graciano and Garnacha.",7 Viñas Reserva,90,68,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Baron De Ley
86352,Spain,"Tres Picos, or Three Peaks, ranks as a go-to wine for fans of round, smooth, slightly oaky reds. The bouquet is all mocha and smoky/oaky richness, while the sticky, rich palate deals blackberry and chewy, rooty medicinality. Oaky and spicy late, with licorice and warmth. The best thing is that it's not heavy or overextracted despite being youthful and modern in style.",Tres Picos,90,17,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Borsao
86381,Spain,"Cherry and raspberry aromas are a little scratchy, with accents of toast, leather and roasted meat. The palate, on the other hand, is more lean, driving and citric than in riper years; it's crisp and fresh, with red plum, pie cherry and toasty oak flavors. Clean, lean and ready to drink.",Crianza,88,18,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
86397,Spain,"This five-grape blend is dark and concentrated, but also a touch soupy and mulchy. Interestingly, the palate shows snappy acidity along the edges, yielding crisp flavors of cherry, raspberry and spice. Finishes dry, herbal and spicy, but needs a boost of fruit to equal previous efforts.",NA,88,27,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Red Blend,Finca Coronado
86527,Spain,"Red in color, with a reedy, cinnamon nose that speaks to the 60% Pinot Noir in the wine. Flavors of strawberry and raspberry are downgraded by a rhubarb quality, and the mouthfell clamps down like a vise. Fruity but not dry or balanced enough to impress.",Rosé Brut,82,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Cristalino
86534,Spain,"If it weren't for the core fruit, which is pretty good, this wine would tank. It's so heavy and dark that it doesn't seem like it will last another week. Probably better if you're sitting in the town of Calatayud; as an export, it's from too warm of a climate to hold up to the travel.",NA,82,10,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Rosé,Viña Alarba
86535,Spain,"Lollipop aromas are muddled and not very convincing, while the palate is unfocused and borders on sour. Foamy and abrasive on the cheeks, with a mediocre flavor profile. From the outside this looks great (nice bottle and label) but the insides are shaky.",Gran Cuvée Extra Brut,82,29,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Roger Goulart

86549,Spain,"Semi-dry Cavas are a risky row, and this wine proves why. It has iodine and dusty lemon aromas, while the palate is chunky and flat, with sweet orange and other candied citrus flavors. Bland and bordering on cloying.",Semi Seco Reserva,82,19,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Roger Goulart
86585,Spain,"Jumbled aromas of medicinal fruit, rubber and oak knit together with airing. The palate is clampy and angular but healthy, with a roasted black-fruit flavor that's accented by an herbal, medicinal note. This is big-boned, with a medicinal side.",NA,86,16,Levante,Bullas,NA,Monastrell,Lorca

86594,Spain,"Dusty and straightforward on the nose, this has aromas of pear and apple. It feels simple, tight and not overly evolved, with a peach flavor that's not too complex. Zesty in feel, this tastes a bit like vitamins and nuts on the finish.",Brut Nature Reserva,86,12,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Sàniger
86595,Spain,"Dry apple and crisp citrus aromas come with a touch of sweet grass. It has lively lemon-lime and apple flavors, and it seems to have beeen dosed on the sweeter side of extra dry. Overall, it's fruity, friendly and likable.",Extra Dry,86,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
86606,Spain,"This starts with funky, saucy aromas that clean up and become less strange with airing. Rugged, tannic and bumpy on the palate, it has baked, rubbery black-fruit flavors. It finishes short and drying, with hard tannins and heat.",Eternum Viti,86,22,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Bodegas Abanico
86637,Spain,"Gaseous, earthy, mossy aromas are not entirely inviting, and the palate is immensely thick and round, with big, grating tannins. But the plum, berry and meaty elements are good, and the finish of chewy tannins goes on for quite some time. An extracted wine with minor balance and aromatic issues.",Gotín del Risc,86,17,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Abad
86639,Spain,"Banana, lemon curd and sawdust are the prime aromas on this oaky, creamy, candied style of Chard from Navarra.

Resiny on the finish, but smooth.",NA,86,14,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Chardonnay,Vega Sindoa
86654,Spain,"Candied and sweet smelling but still honest on the nose, with spice, cinnamon and black cherry aromas.

86667,Spain,"Fruity, sweet, a touch rubbery, and very much what you should expect from a good, ready, well-made Garnacha from Aragón.

Drink now through 2012.",NA,88,11,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Garnacha,Monfil
86736,Spain,"A fine wine but not up to par with previous renditions. This vintage has proprietary blueberry, floral and jammy aromas, while the palate is narrow and a touch sheering and tannic, with jammy dark berry flavors and not a lot of variety or complexity. Forward, linear and monotone, but what's here is quite good. Drink now–2013.",Calvario,90,145,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Finca Allende
86747,Spain,"As far as value-priced Ruedas go, this is at the top of the heap. The nose is forward, clean as glass and not too pungent or demanding.

86753,Spain,"Full and spicy from the get-go, with hints of clove vying with savory berry and leather. The optimum word to describe this wine is friendly, meaning it delivers ripeness, berry flavors and sweet, spicy accents that complete the package. Leans toward baked and sweet but keeps things properly framed.",Reserva,90,22,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marqués de Campo Nuble
86795,Spain,"This is supersmooth and attractive, with earth, cola, tobacco, balsam and solid berry aromas.

Below-average stuff.",Spanish Sons,82,13,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Fariña
86842,Spain,"Made from the local Rufete grape, this is a prickly, slightly pickled wine. The flavors seem underdeveloped and pithy like pink grapefruit, while the palate feel doesn't really mesh. Too out there to savor a second sip.",Rosado de Lágrima,82,12,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Rufete,Viña Salamanca

86847,Spain,"Plum, spice and baked-fruit aromas give you some hope, but the palate on this no-dosage Pinot Noir Cava is tart to the point of being sour.

86912,Spain,"A good taste of Toro at the right price. The nose deals classic baked fruit, rubber and girth, while the warm, full palate shows reasonable vitality along with berry and cassis flavors. Solid and a little chocolaty on the finish. A textbook warm-climate Spanish wine.",Auroch,86,12,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Tribal
86931,Spain,"Perfectly drinkable Monastrell year after year despite the silly name. Plum and roasted berry aromas and flavors are sweet, ripe, clean and on the generic side of the fence. A little rugged and hot at 15%, but lusty and good for the price.",NA,86,8,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Wrongo Dongo
87040,Spain,"Lemon, apple blossom and honey aromas make for a correct, attractive bouquet. Meanwhile, the palate is typically crisp and vibrant, with cutting acids that push the pineapple and citrus flavors to a point.

87043,Spain,"Alconte is the new second wine from Montecastro, but it doesn't take a back seat to anything. It's powerful juice, with a strong mineral/floral element on the bouquet. Aged only a year in oak, it maintains a crisp, charred character and shows tight raspberry flavors, chocolate and pepper. Features all the right stuff for a debut wine from a strained vintage.",Alconte,89,23,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Montecastro
87045,Spain,"Concentrated and solid, but not a wrecking ball. The nose offers tobacco and earthy aromas, while the palate is jammy and smooth, with sweet flavors of blackberry, fig and tobacco.

87049,Spain,"For an '07, this shows nice fruit and a direct, honest approach.

Drink now–2014.",Crianza,89,NA,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Carmelo Rodero
87091,Spain,"Roasted and rubbery, this features potent leather and compost aromas that settle with airing. Angular, aggressive and full of power and lemony oak, it also has raw wood and heavily toasted black-fruit flavors. Long, peppery and choppy, it's powerful and stomping. Best to hold this for 3–5 years before drinking, when it should emerge as a better, more approachable wine.",Expresión,91,70,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Alidis
87110,Spain,"Expansive and generous on the nose, this has all the bold berry aromas for which Ribera del Duero is known. It feels tight as a drum, with staunch acidity. Flavors of dark fruit and chocolate are typical for a small-production—150 cases—modern wine. It's tight, spicy and integrated on the finish, with a lasting note of lemony oak. Best 2014–2018.",Collection,91,55,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Loess
87120,Spain,"Modest lime and stone aromas don't give it much push, and the bubbly, foamy palate of candied apple and other sweet fruits isn't much of a savior.

87131,Spain,"A tart, stemmy wine with sour red-fruit flavors borrowed from the cherry and plum families. Choppy and acidic, with a biting palate and not much good on offer.

87135,Spain,"A jumbled wine with strange aromas of bacon and wild herbs that are followed by a clipped, scouring palate that's driven by ultrasharp acidity.

87143,Spain,"Cristalino has always done well with crisp, straightforward Cavas. This attempt at something higher fails; it's a cidery, flat wine without much kick, zest or bead. Chunky and lacking electricity.",Brut Nature,81,15,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Cristalino

87250,Spain,"Decent and quaffable but does not compare to the winery's Verdejo. This is prickly and full of pine needle, juniper and other sharp aromas. The palate has a good feel but pickled, briney flavors. Skeletal given its warm-climate origins.",NA,85,11,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Sauvignon Blanc,Montespina
87269,Spain,"Raspberry and rubber aromas are solid if not refined, while the firm palate is sweet and full of black cherry flavor.

87340,Spain,"Clean lines and fresh, oak-tinged aromas is what this Viura (with 10% Malvasia) is all about. The nose starts with lemon, green apple and a spot of vanilla, while the juicy palate brings bright white fruits, toasty oak and smoke. Not overly complex but not rudimentary or dull.

87394,Spain,"Only 400 cases of this top-level crianza were made, and it smells rich and good, with notes of ripe berry and plum and a mild syrupy note.

87637,Spain,"This is a really good example of a blended wine from Aragón. It's 50% Garnacha with 25% each Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon, and thus it is more complex and interesting than your run-of-the-mill varietal Grenache.

87648,Spain,"A wine that reflects its northern Ribera location (Sotillo) through zesty, pointed aromas and some gritty char and minerality. The nose shows plenty of solid oak, chocolate and spice, and in the mouth the acids are a bit sharp and thus the wine is kind of spiky and angular.

87807,Spain,"The aromas are slightly maderized and soft, with hints of baked apple and corn cake. It feels plump, mealy and a touch flat, with nectarine and wheat flavors. Chunky and peachy on the finish, this is starting to fade.",La Casa de las Esencias,85,12,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Pico Cuadro
87840,Spain,"Neutral for the most part, with a slight citric pungency. Tastes like apple, spice and dried papaya, and the feel is round as opposed to zesty or angular. Lasting on the back end, with a final note of grapefruit.",NA,85,13,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo-Viura,Emina
87843,Spain,"A little rusty in color, with earthy, stemmy, baked fruit aromas mixed with a dose of dried leaves. Seems a lot like Cabernet Franc with its herbal, leafy overtones and dry plum and cherry flavors. Finishes short and herbal, but with good feel and flow.",Care Crianza,85,20,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Tempranillo-Merlot,Bodegas Añadas
87844,Spain,"The nose shows buttered popcorn, toast and baked apple, while the palate is tangy and tastes of tart white fruits, green apple and toast. Has good flow and a cleansing feel to it. Not bad for an oaky blend of Viura and Chardonnay.",Becquer Blanco,85,18,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Bodegas Escudero
87848,Spain,"Floral, sweet and not the least bit complicated or strained. This is easygoing red wine for easy times. It's a bit candied and baked, but that's Garnacha from Central Spain. Decently balanced and sturdy, especially given the price tag.",NA,85,6,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Grenache,Viña Borgia
87865,Spain,"Medicinal black fruit aromas are a little burnt and brambly, while the palate is snappy, acidic and tannic, with tomato, raspberry and oak-driven creaminess. Finishes dry, with a lasting flavor of vanilla that tempers overriding acidity.",Bajoz Crianza,85,13,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tempranillo,Pagos del Rey
87885,Spain,"Spicy and jumpy on the nose, with pine and juniper notes coming alongside more normal berry and cherry scents.

Lightly herbal and oaky on the finish, with good length.",JME,87,25,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Muriel
87932,Spain,"Roasted and charred, with a a clear and present barrel influence along with thyme, herbs and tomato leaf. In the mouth, it's sweet and ready, with ripe berry flavors touched up by cocoa. Toasty and a little minty on the finish, but flavorful and perfectly good as a whole.",Campo Burgo Reserva,89,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marqués de Campo Nuble
87950,Spain,"A good to very good wine with medicinality on the nose that takes over the aromatics. There's also the slightest bit of hard cheese and stem on the bouquet, so overall it is fighting an uphill battle. Along the way it delivers flavors of cough drop, cherry and a good, solid finish.",NA,88,69,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Neo
87952,Spain,"If someone says Vilarnau brut, you should say, yes, I'd love a glass. This bubbly will win you over with its dense but controlled palate and flavors of orange and sweet, ripe grapefruit. It has a bit of green to it and it draws back nicely on the tongue without overfizzing.",Brut,88,15,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Vilarnau
87956,Spain,"Falls into the dark and roasted category, with aromas of leather, black fruits and toast. The palate is saturated and full, with dark, roasted black fruit, molasses and spice flavors. Warm on the finish almost to the point of being hot, but not quite. A very solid wine overall.",Crianza,88,19,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Marques de Tomares
87958,Spain,"Deep and earthy smelling, with meatiness, black fruit and hickory notes to the bouquet. The wine offers concentration and thickness, with ripe, slightly medicinal flavors of plum and blackberry. The same goes for the finish, and overall this is a medium-to-full Grenache that gets it done.",Old Vines,88,15,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Grenache,Quo
87959,Spain,"Sweet and full of raspberry aromas, foresty scents and sandalwood. Overall it's a well-made, intriguing Grenache with a fleshy, sturdy body and deep cherry, berry and chocolate flavors. It's a bit tannic, but that only helps the structure. Finishes nicely, with dry spice and vanilla notes.",La Miranda de Secastilla,88,15,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Garnacha,Viñas del Vero
87997,Spain,"Briary berry, leather and animal aromas comprise the bouquet on this full-forced effort. Astringent and jumpy in feel, it has piercing acidity, propelling the tangy flavors of berry, currant and plum. It's toasty, offering a pinch of tobacco on the finish. Drink 2013–2017.",Elite,90,40,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinta Fina,Prado Rey
88012,Spain,"Graham cracker, raisin, earth and leather aromas announce a level of richness. It feels prune-like and saturated but not flat, with blackberry and exotic spice flavors. It qualifies as a lush, ripe specimen with a long finish that stays the course. Syrah, Cabernet and Tempranillo are the components.",NA,90,52,Central Spain,Vinos de Madrid,NA,Red Blend,Licinia
88048,Spain,"A high level of purity from the start. The bouquet attracts with strong scents of mineral, flowers, wild herbs, berry fruit and toast. There's no shortage of bracing acidity, so the body weight and balance are just right. One of Spain's most food-friendly, elegant wines, and not run of the mill. The best expression of Mencia on the market today.",Villa de Corullon,92,45,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Descendientes de J. Palacios
88083,Spain,"Starts out with stalky, corny aromas that are typical of sweet Cavas. It feels candied and almost cloying, but adequate acidity comes to the rescue. Flavors of melon, mango and kiwi are sweet, while the finish suggests corn cakes and tropical fruits.",Aria Estate Extra Dry,85,14,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
88092,Spain,"This smells like fresh pavement at first, with gritty black-fruit and burnt leaf notes. The palate feels edgy, with a spotty red-fruit flavor that's matched with notes of resiny oak and vanilla. It finishes in a similar fashion.

88153,Spain,"Generic peach and melon aromas are pleasant, clean and simple, while flavors of pineapple, melon, mango and kumquat are basic and sweet, almost like canned fruit salad. Finishes pithy, with some banana-like sweetness.",Viña 27,84,10,Catalonia,Costers del Segre,NA,Chardonnay,Raimat
88155,Spain,"Wild, foxy and full of young, bursting berry fruit. There's nothing tamed or refined or special about this youthful Tempranillo. The flavors of plum and berries are intense, bright, grabby and modest in what they deliver. Consistent wine from year to year.",NA,84,6,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,Campos Reales
88166,Spain,"Starts with earthy burnt aromas, but in short time cassis and berry aromas rise to the surface. Fresh and tangy feeling, with spunky red fruit and tomato flavors. Finishes a little saucy, with more tomato and an herbal aftertaste.",NA,84,10,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo-Shiraz,Penascal
88187,Spain,"Full, sweet, a touch reduced and granular on the nose, but exemplary of what affordable Garnacha from a good vintage should be like. The palate is stacked and deep, while the flavors are a mix of wild berry, rubber, toast and espresso. Turns a bit hot on the finish, but food will tame that. Drink now.",NA,87,10,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Garnacha,Lelia
88230,Spain,"Dark as night and thick, with heavy, modern aromas of shoe polish, bacon and ripe, roasted black fruits. The feel is concentrated and healthy, while the flavors run very ripe and dark, with plenty of oak thrown in. Finishes rich, with bacon, resin, black pepper and some burn. Seems more jacked up than its listed 14.5% alcohol.",NA,88,16,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,Volver
88236,Spain,"Crisp, clean and nice on the nose, with a hint of white pepper. The palate is round and not overly acidic, making it friendly and endowed with mass appeal. Flavors of green melon and citrus are smooth and not too demanding, while the finish is easy and clean. A welcome entry into the land of Rueda and its Verdejo.",NA,88,11,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Emina
88245,Spain,"In many ways, this is Valdemar's best wine in that it's always consistent and satisfying. The nose on this vintage offers a blast of sweet coconut and then black fruit aromas, and while there's acidity front and center it doesn't come across sharp. Instead, the focus is on plum and raspberry fruit and a finish that picks up steam.",Conde de Valdemar Crianza,88,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Valdemar
88249,Spain,"Snappy and a little green on the nose, with hints of juniper and green apple. The palate is perfectly good but nothing special, while the flavors of apple and citrus are punchy and pure. Frothy but controlled, with lots of flavor and forward kick. Apéritif city!",Brut Reserva,88,13,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Juvé y Camps
88251,Spain,"For those who like an old-school, oxidized style of white Rioja (think López de Heredia), Murrieta's Capellanía is up your alley. The nose is almost like Sherry in its creamy, maderized state, while the palate is low in power, with coconut and lemon flavors. Finishes soft, with vanilla. A unique, identifiable white wine that's not for everyone. Drink now.",Capellanía,88,26,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Marqués de Murrieta
88273,Spain,"Minty and on the nose, this has notes of licorice, black fruit and a funky kick.

Toasty and extremely dark on the finish.",6 Meses,90,17,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Pictor
88275,Spain,"Focused and salinic, offering mild white-flower and peach aromas, this feels full, round, fleshy and balanced, with pithy citrus, peach and almond flavors that lead nicely to a smooth, melony finish. This is about as complex as Albariño gets.",NA,90,24,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Pazo de Señorans
88321,Spain,"Minimum was impressive wine in 2003 and it's better in 2004. Cambra's blend of 70% Monastrell and 30% Cabernet Franc is probably the best wine coming from the obscure Valencia D.O. It is generous, balanced, rich and lusty; flavors of blackberry, cassis and plum are succulent and every hole or gap seems filled by tannin, flesh and flavor. Drink now through 2011.",Minimum,92,75,Levante,Valencia,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Rafael Cambra
88380,Spain,"Gaseous berry aromas settle on pepper, oregano and earth tones. It feels tight, full and potent, with herbal, peppery flavors of black fruit and licorice.

88386,Spain,"Straightforward peach aromas come with a stalky, grassy side. It feels zesty, spritzy and citric, then tastes almost entirely of orange and tangerine, with a dry finish.",Valiñas,85,13,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Ramón Bilbao
88393,Spain,"Ripe, minty and exuberant on the front end, this has a hint of animal in addition to a note of blueberry. Saturated and simple, this has a ripe red-berry flavor that comes across as red licorice. Fruity and fun.",Jaloco Joven,85,10,Central Spain,Ribera del Guadiana,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Medina
88396,Spain,"Forward and direct up front, this has a yeasty but fresh apple aroma. It feels clean and ready, with lemon-lime and kiwi flavors that lead to a fresh finish. This is textbook Cava with some sweetness.",Cordon Negro Extra Dry,85,12,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
88403,Spain,"Nervy raspberry and cherry aromas come with a pinch of green herb. It feels astringent yet structured and crisp, with edgy red-berry and herb flavors. Lively, fiery and mildly acidic on the finish.",Alegre,85,13,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Torre Castillo
88404,Spain,"Raisiny on the nose, but even with the bouquet's overripeness, it settles on the palate, showing fresh raisin and cassis flavors, with just enough acidity to keep it balanced. Jammy and short on the finish.",NA,85,9,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Almez
88455,Spain,"Slightly cooked-smelling on first take, with hints of stem and rubber. It improves over time, showing earthy berry fruits and leather. The palate is pretty good and lively, with earthy, herbal flavors of berry, tea and spice. A little stewy and herbal, but still a good Ribera wine.",Crianza,87,30,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Recoletas
88470,Spain,"Aromas of milk chocolate, cotton candy, bacon and sweet fruits are a lead into standard fare cherry and raspberry flavors. The feel is acidic but fresh, while the finish is thin but clean. Average wine.",Roble,84,16,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Vilano
88472,Spain,"Opens with black cherry, baked plum and other heavy, semiroasted aromas. The palate is chunky but weak on definition and structure, while the flavors are limited to dry red-apple skins and bland red fruit. Acidic as well, which leads to a washed-out finish.",Dama de Toro Crianza,84,15,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Fariña
88475,Spain,"Pure and driving, but also acidic and woody in aromas and flavors. Can't say that this barrel fermented Viura-based white is Muga's best wine. It's crisp with green apple and pineapple, but also a little sour and simple. With 10% Malvasia.",Barrel Fermented,84,16,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Viura,Muga
88480,Spain,"Vanilla and a lot of oak blend with baked apple on the nose, while the palate is grabby and resiny, with drawn, oak-heavy flavors of baked apple and vanilla. For a winery that rarely misses with its red wines, this is one that's o.k. but probably not worth the money.",Organza,84,28,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Sierra Cantabria
88485,Spain,"Opens with generic berry aromas and a slight candied, gaseous undercurrent. The palate is modest and lean, with decent raspberry flavors and not a whole lot of follow through. Basic and a bit rubbery.",Tinto,84,14,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Vilano
88488,Spain,"Begins with a sweet marshmallow creaminess on the nose, which is followed by a firm, tanninc palate with snappy cherry and raspberry flavors. Clean and easy to understand, but in the end it's a very regular wine.",Tinto,84,13,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Pago del Vostal
88497,Spain,"Briar and rhubarb aromas suggest stemminess, but the palate is fairly clean and clear, with tight, rubbery tannins supporting red fruit flavors of cherry and plum. Short, rubbery and unexceptional, but good enough despite a whiff of green that's probably due to the Cabernet in the wine.",Rojo,84,9,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Basico
88533,Spain,"Nice wine with standard Rioja aromas of raspberry, vanilla, licorice and dill. The palate has life and kick due to protruding acidity, while the flavor profile is based on snappy, high-toned plum and red berry. Softer on the finish, where butter and vanilla notes rise up. Drinkable now but will hold for another few years.",Reserva,88,22,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Castillo Labastida
88556,Spain,"Opens with young, punchy aromas of candied raspberry and strawberry. The body is easygoing but the flavors and overall character are more complex than you might expect because Sastre only made this wine and a crianza in '08 while eschewing its high-end wines. With this youngster expect moderate size and intensity, and a full, semilong finish.",Roble,88,20,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Sastre
88576,Spain,"Like the barrica (barrel) in its name implies, this is a toasty wine, with vanilla, yeast and elegant white-fruit aromas. Full bodied, it has citrus and apple notes, with mild oxidation in front of the toasty finish. A classy Cava to drink now.",Gran Reserva Brut Nature Barrica,90,53,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Macabeo,Agustí Torelló Mata
88682,Spain,"Milk chocolate, plastic and wet dog aromas improve with airing. It's abrasive and scratchy on the palate, with blackberry and milk chocolate flavors that lead to a finish with one last dosage of milk chocolaty sweetness. This contains 15% Garnacha.",NA,85,14,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Familia Solana
88686,Spain,"This offers grassy, ashy aromas of green-leaning berry and plum fruits. It feels grabby and choppy, with berry flavors that lead to a dry, lightly herbal-tasting finish.",Viña Honda,85,14,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Bodegas Silvano Garcia

88691,Spain,"Saline, mineral, match stick and tropical fruit aromas define the bouquet. It feels plump but flat, with maderized flavors of white fruits that feature bitterness and not much kick. It's fleshy, remaining slightly bitter on the finish.",NA,85,18,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Viña Ludy
88695,Spain,"This starts with some Verdejo sweat and funk on the nose, and while those notes don't last, the bouquet doesn't improve dramatically with airing. It feels soft and basic, with melon and lettuce flavors. Falls off a bit on the finish, which tastes a bit briney.",Ducado de Altan,85,13,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Naia
88705,Spain,"This has raisin, earth, mint and dried herb aromas. It feels narrow, but concentrated, tasting of earthy tomato, baked plum and fresh green herb. It has a solid mouthfeel, with a mildly briney finish.",Crianza,84,9,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,Finca Vieja
88708,Spain,"A granular, horsey note is the greeting, and never does this truly find its sweet spot. The aromas are raisiny, while the palate is angular and acidic. Flavors of tomato, herb, tobacco and plum don't quite find their footing. The finish is thick and tastes of molasses, carob and herb.",El Vínculo,84,32,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Alejandro Fernandez
88743,Spain,"Dark on the nose, with licorice notes and mildly roasted black fruit aromas. Ripe, properly sized and balanced, with lightly candied blackberry flavors leading to a smooth finish with a hint of coffee. For the price and origin, it's right on.",Albaliza,87,9,Central Spain,Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Tikalo
88759,Spain,"Just makes it to that next level of quality via bright, jumpy, fresh aromas and flavors of raspberry and cherry. It's a simple varietal Grenache that's bright and easy to like if you're into zesty raspberry and berry flavors uplifted by spunky acidity. Best with a little chill on the temperature.",Silver Label,87,12,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Garnacha,Castillo de Monséran
88776,Spain,"Opens with decent dusty apple and peach aromas, but they don't really hold together for long. And the palate is similar in that it offers adequate opening flavors of green apple and citrus but no improvement after that. Drink right away; it won't age well.",Blanco,84,9,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Sauvignon Blanc,Basico
88777,Spain,"More soft and milky than exact or pungent, with bitterness intermixed with apple on the palate. Feels a little soft and bland for such a young Rueda white. Perfectly drinkable but uninspired.",NA,84,10,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Analivia
88786,Spain,"Pithy, heavy and chunky, with waxy fruit mixed with oak. The wine has a pretty good mouthfeel and balance, but it just doesn't do much in terms of aromatics or in the flavor category. Decent for a barrel fermented Viura but nothing to write home about.",Barrel Fermented White,84,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Marqués de Cáceres
88789,Spain,"Raisiny and baked on the nose, with a syrupy consistency to the palate. Along the way there's stewed fruit, baked blackberry pie notes and overt sweetness. Candied, ultrarich and tilting toward molasses on the finish.",Gravedad,83,13,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Casto Pequeño
88794,Spain,"Not a lot to latch onto here. The aromas are sharp and sweaty, while the palate feel is more dull than it should be, while flavors of melon and pickled fruits are briney.",NA,83,10,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Sauvignon Blanc,Analivia
88835,Spain,"Familiar aromas of black fruit, licorice and earth get it going, followed by saturated body weight that reaches all corners of the mouth while displaying earthy, chunky blackberry and black cherry flavors. Flush, comfortable and slightly heavy. Drink now through 2012.",Reserva,88,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Ramirez de la Piscina
88843,Spain,"From Miguel Angel de Gregorio of Finca Allende, this is a nice, thorough, creamy white with aromas of white fruits, vanilla and straw.

88862,Spain,"This is cool on the nose, with tree bark and tobacco aromas that come together well. Tannic and stout, it's not punishing, with a roasted black-fruit flavor and a backing of espresso bitterness. This shows a syrupy side and also raw power.

88876,Spain,"Among Cavas, this is one of the more yeasty, full-bodied and creamy wines you'll find; it's also cidery, dusty and heavy on the nose. Round, it offers plenty of depth to frame the flavors of candied peach, melon, pear, tarragon and thyme. Although it's a bit foamy and coarse, overall this is a flavorful, complex, demanding Cava to drink now–2015.",Imperial Gran Reserva Brut,89,30,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Gramona

88943,Spain,"Here's yet another impressive Garnacha-based wine from the traveling Scotsman Norrel Robertson. There's a black-fruit component that's aided by dried oregano, thyme and briar. The mouth, however, is juicy and ripe, with Syrah-influenced flavors of spice and herbs de Provence. Finishes with licorice, pepper and perfect size. The best wine in Robertson's portfolio.",NA,91,21,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Red Blend,Papa Luna

89074,Spain,"Years ago Rívola was one of Spain's standout value wines; but over time it has devolved. This version is mulchy and muddled, with heavy roasted fruit and red pepper aromas.

89077,Spain,"Creamy and confected on the nose, which is proof of the “roble” designation. The palate is rather narrow and acidic, with semi-sour flavors of berry and cherry. Cleansing and tart; decent but doesn't go beyond that.",Roble,83,15,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Pago del Vostal
89080,Spain,"Smells like bath soap, then turns grassy and burnt. Tannic and medicinal in the mouth, although better as it airs out. Tastes and feels overdone and super sweet.",El Chaparral de Vega Sindoa Old Vines,83,14,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Garnacha,Vega Sindoa
89081,Spain,"Decent mass-produced Ribera del Duero. Strawberry and raspberry aromas lean you in the red fruit direction, and the palate is scouring, acidic and full of cherry fruit. Fresh on the finish and hard, but at least it doesn't have off flavors.",NA,83,9,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Viña del Val
89082,Spain,"Austere, green aromas are about as much as one can pull from the nose, while the palate is fresh and acidic, but lean.

89199,Spain,"Ripe berry, mild raisin and overall clarity define the bouquet. This offers a full, complete mouthfeel, with structure and layers of roasted berry, spice and integrated herb. It's sturdy and long on the satisfying finish.",Crianza,89,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Burgo Viejo
89210,Spain,"Solid cherry and berry aromas are smooth and appealing, while a spot of pinched leather adds character to the nose. This feels tight and good, with racy acidity leading a red plum flavor to a dry, tight finish. Nice in a no-nonsense way.",Crianza,89,NA,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Mayor
89219,Spain,"Tobacco and clove aromas ride high on the mildly leafy bouquet. It feels round, juicy, tannic and tight, with mature berry, spice, earth and leather flavors. It remains earthy and mature on the finish, which fades to a blackened, spicy expression with notes of tomato and spice.",Gran Reserva Tempranillo-Graciano,89,36,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Ontañón
89293,Spain,"This is spicy and dry on the nose, with a cheesy accent. It feels medium in body, with sharp acidity that creates a semisour flavor profile of red plum and cherry. Not overly flavorful, it concludes with a crisp, cleansing finish.",NA,84,12,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Garnacha,Finca Antigua
89294,Spain,"The cola and licorice aromas are candied and easygoing. This feels acidic and snappy, with red cherry and berry flavors that end with a crisp, sheer, rugged feel.",Reserva,84,35,Levante,Utiel-Requena,NA,Red Blend,Finca Casa Lo Alto
89296,Spain,"This smells a bit wayward and sulfuric, but it's juicy and acidic on the tongue, with lemony and oily, nutty flavors. It holds steady on the finish, which is lemony in character.",Finca Constancia,84,10,Central Spain,Toledo,NA,Verdejo-Sauvignon Blanc,Altozano
89304,Spain,"The bouquet is dry, briney and otherwise neutral. It feels wide and lemony, with flavors of citrus and white fruits. It remains mildly pickled on the finish.",Blanco,84,18,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Loess
89308,Spain,"Aromas of canned peaches and apricots are about all one can pull from the bouquet. It feels solid and untamed, with juicy flavors that run straight to mango, Dole peach and sweetened papaya. It's short on character and complexity but big on sweet, sticky flavors.",Naturalmente Dulce,84,23,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Moscatel,Finca Antigua
89350,Spain,"Smells like a kirsch liqueur on the bouquet. The palate, somewhat surprisingly, is much sharper than the nose, with tangy, zesty flavors of red fruits that some might adore and others will label too thin and sour. Sheer but fresh on the finish, with pulsing acidity. Personally, I find this rather sharp and wanting, given the origin.",Torre de Golbán Reserva,86,20,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto Fino,Atalayas de Golbán
89355,Spain,"Delicate and lithe Sauvignon Blanc from Navarra? Interesting. Tastes sort of Galician due to its clean, tropical pineapple, citrus and green apple flavors. Like a fruit salad with more acidity; doesn't taste particularly Sauvignon-ish, but likable nonetheless.",Orchidea,86,13,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Sauvignon Blanc,Inurrieta
89372,Spain,"Rusty colored and flat on the nose. Aromas of medicinal fruit and horse hide are less than stellar, and the soupy palate of weak raspberry and faux sweetness doesn't do much to improve things. Needs more vitality and overall quality.",NA,82,10,Central Spain,Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Altozano
89376,Spain,"Starts with nutty, oily, acrid aromas, and never is there much fruit character. The palate has bite but still seems short on acidity, and the flavors run toward funky citrus, asparagus and green beans. On the global scale of SB, this doesn't really cut it.",NA,82,10,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Sauvignon Blanc,Penascal
89387,Spain,"Generic fruit, hard rubber, olive and leather on the nose. Dry and tannic, with bitter black plum and a rock-hard finish. Tough and just not that much fun to drink.",Finca la Sabina,82,14,Central Spain,Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Sanchez Muliterno
89393,Spain,"One of the strangest-smelling wines we've encountered from Spain: there's forced cinnamon, heavy funk, dampness and other unfamiliar, foreign scents. The palate has weight and a gritty feeel, while the core flavors are Sherried. Hard to see the appeal here.",Veleta Nolados,81,16,Andalucia,Vino de la Tierra Contraviesa Alpujarra,NA,Red Blend,Dominio Buenavista
89396,Spain,"Funky, sour, gumball aromas and flavors, and then not a whole lot else. Short on character, with little to make note of other than sweaty berry flavors, tartness and bramble.",NA,80,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Terracita
89433,Spain,"A bit earthy and leafy on the nose and palate, with lightweight strawberry and raspberry aromas and flavors. The wine has a clacky, almost metallic feel to it along with hints of tobacco and green bean. Vanilla and sweetness push the finish, which is also slightly green. Hails from Cádiz in southwestern Spain.",Finca Moncloa,87,35,Andalucia,Vino de la Tierra de Cádiz,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,González Byass
89436,Spain,"A steal for six bucks; the nose is floral and black, but under control. Meanwhile, the palate is bouncy, round and balanced, with juicy black plum and wild berry flavors. Clean and solid.",Viña Borgia,87,6,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Grenache,Borsao
89455,Spain,"Pink meets orange in terms of hue, while the nose gives a nice blend of sweet and snappy berry and citrus. The palate has a little weight and heft along with dry, white-peppery flavors of nectarine and apricot. Pithy, citrusy and healthy throughout. Good wine for the money.",Protocolo,87,7,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Rosé,Dominio de Eguren
89457,Spain,"Sort of scratchy and generic on the nose, with reasonably fresh red fruit aromas. The mouthfeel is angular and clipped by piercing acidity, while the flavors are of nice but regular black cherry and plum. Fairly juicy and fresh as a whole.",Crianza,87,14,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,El Circulo
89483,Spain,"Buttercup and fresh pear aromas are friendly and inviting. It feels full and correct, with good acids and minerality. Flavors of pears, melons and lees are very nice, while the finish is simultaneously flowery, crisp and salinic.",Peitán,89,15,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Nora
89485,Spain,"The green fruit and subtle, yeasty hay aromas are inviting. It feels nice and not abrasive, with notes of dried apple, citrus and rich, toasty yeast. It perks up on the finish, with dryness, zest and complexity. Very nice for $15.",Cuvée Henri Reserva Limited Production,89,15,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Loxarel
89528,Spain,"Pure apple and peach aromas are the calling card of a good Albariño, and Pazo de Senorans always has that and a little more. The '08 seems a touch less concentrated and leesy than prior years, but it's still showing all the marine-influenced personality, beauty and elegance of a no-oak, seafood-friendly winner. Drink right away; it's not meant for keeping. Imported by European Cellars.",NA,91,25,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Pazo de Señorans
89580,Spain,"Rubber, flower petal and candied fruit aromas comprise the unique bouquet. The palate is solid but edgy, bearing grabby tannins and heaviness, with sweet flavors of blackberry, cassis and pepper. Monotone on the finish, then bitter at the very end. This is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Marqués de Badajoz El Marqués Dulce,84,18,Central Spain,Extremadura,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bodegas Medina
89592,Spain,"This is sharp smelling, with aromas of field greens, rhubarb and scratchy spices. It's light in weight, with short, herbal and spicy flavors that center on a strawberry note.",NA,83,12,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo,El Furioso
89594,Spain,"This has a reedy red-berry aroma and a citrus note. Confirmation of the bouquet comes on the palate, which is lean and scouring, with red plum, pomegranate and herb flavors. The finish is cleansing, but it doesn't show much substance.",Altitud 1.100 Garnacha Tintorera,83,10,Central Spain,Almansa,NA,Alicante Bouschet,Santa Quiteria
89600,Spain,"There's virtually no bouquet to this wine, and the palate follows suit with a flat feel and hollow, faded flavors of balsamic-doused cherry and herb. It seems aged and dried out.",Reserva,83,10,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,Finca Vieja
89601,Spain,"A jammy raspberry aroma comes with milk chocolate and plastic scents. It feels pulpy yet spunky, with red plum and strawberry flavors. The mild finish doesn't evolve or expand, but it registers as being fresh.",Old Vines Crianza,83,13,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Navarro López
89605,Spain,"Dusty and yeasty on the nose, this has an eggy, sweaty note. It feels good but drifts a bit on the palate, while the flavors run stalky and sweet, with a touch of apple for crispness.",Cristalino Extra-Dry,83,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Jaume Serra
89608,Spain,"Gaseous and minerally on first blush, it has funky, earthy aromas of leaves and olive that could use a hit of freshness. It feels grabby and scratchy, with an olive flavor and a hot finish that has a latex-like character. This is a big wine that misses some elegance.",Valdueza,83,18,Central Spain,Extremadura,NA,Red Blend,Marqués de Valdueza
89672,Spain,"Dry, herbal aromas mix with a light cherry perfume and lemon peel. The palate is a bit sharp but it's clean and fresh, with dry, crisp cherry flavors mixing with hints of coffee and black pepper. Finishes light and dry; a tapas wine for sure.",Proyecto Cu4tro,86,12,Catalonia,Catalunya,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Concavins
89673,Spain,"Nice violet and minerally aromas mix with sweet berry scents, and right then you know you have a competent, correct Garnacha on your hands. It's a bit acidic and bouncy, but the flavors of berry and plum are firm, tasty and fade well on the finish. A fresh and zesty wine for near-term drinking.",ia,86,11,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Garnacha,Bodegas Virgen del Águila
89674,Spain,"Hard and roasted on the nose, with molasses, leather and other less-than-fruity aromas. It's narrow and clampy in the mouth, with herbal, distant flavors of peppery red fruits. Shows some roughness and tannic bite on the finish, and also a bit of stemminess. Good but for the price and vintage it has some weaknesses.",Finca Valdelagua,86,30,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Red Blend,Casa del Valle
89690,Spain,"Peach and melon aromas are inviting and clean. Very juicy and juice-like in the mouth, probably more so than I can remember for this wine. It tastes like orange, tangerine and grapefuit juices mixed together. The texture isn't very smooth or wine-like; seems less refined and less minerally than in the past.",NA,86,19,Northern Spain,Valdeorras,NA,Godello,Viña Godeval
89739,Spain,"Like most base-level Garnachas, this one has a sweet, candied aromatic cover. But unlike many it has depth, purity and avoids boring, offensive sweetness. The flavors of raspberry and boysenberry are bright, and it maintains balance and integrity through the finish. A nice wine for under $10.",Los Dos Old Vines,87,8,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Grenache-Syrah,Almira
89765,Spain,"Aromas of cedar cigar box, subtle flower, spice and dry berry form a good bouquet. Searing acidity creates some sharpness, while the primary flavors of berry and plum are offset by red tomato and dry spice. Roasted, dry, spicy and slightly bitter on the finish.",Reserva,89,24,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Valdubón
89768,Spain,"Apple and other white fruit aromas come with hints of sea foam and clam shell. The palate is tight, mineral-driven and citric, with some spritz. Flavors of apple and pithy citrus lead to a long, speedy finish, with generous acidity.",Esencia Diviña,89,23,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Adegas Gran Vinum
89769,Spain,"This has a scent of baked apple, and in the mouth, it seems just as much a still white wine as a Cava, with a soft bead that indicates that it's starting to lose steam. Flavors of melon, citrus and pineapple finish with vanilla and chunky weight.",Gran Reserva Brut Nature,89,39,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Agustí Torelló Mata
89775,Spain,"Rusty and light in color, this has earth, compost and root notes, with dry leather aromas.

Drink now.",Conde de los Andes Gran Reserva,89,33,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Federico Paternina
89777,Spain,"Berry and dark plum aromas accompany tobacco, spice and baking spice notes. This feels mostly fresh and vital, with drying tannins and a firm build.

89783,Spain,"Another good bubbly from Sonim, this red-colored sparkler is dry on the nose, with cherry and cassis aromas.

Much darker in color than most rosé Cavas.",Brut Rosé,89,14,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Sonim
89784,Spain,"This is punchy and full of potent black-fruit aromas that turn jammy upon airing. It feels lush, thick and chewy, with ripe, dense berry flavors that come with plenty of young oak.

89814,Spain,"Controlled, expressive and impressive for Garnacha. Dark fruit and dark spice are the lead actors, while the supporting cast includes a lush feel and good length. Frankly this is a delicious, well-made Garnacha that pours on the black fruit and brown sugar. Dense and balanced from start to finish.",Gran Viu Garnacha del Terreno,90,60,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Garnacha,Viñedos y Bodegas Pablo
89828,Spain,"Roasted and stalky smelling, this has earthy berry and tomato aromas. It feels a bit flat, with a stewed, saucy red-berry flavor. The finish is adequate, with oak-based clove and herb notes.",Al Muvedre Tinto Joven,83,15,Levante,Alicante,NA,Monastrell,Telmo Rodríguez
89842,Spain,"Stewy yet flush, with shearing acids, this has a meaty, leafy aroma that sets up the angular palate. Flavors of stewed berry, spiced tomato and burnt leaves turn slightly bitter on what amounts to a short finish.",Crianza,83,15,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,Gladium
89843,Spain,"A leathery, herbal aroma outmuscles the distant berry and cherry scents. It feels hard and high in acidity, with raspberry and snappy red-plum flavors. It's citrusy and crisp on the finish, with lasting tang.",NA,83,8,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,Finca Vieja
89851,Spain,"Dark in color, with a heavy, semiflat nose that is sort of gaseous. Airing brings it out of its slumber, unveiling medium-bright dark fruit, schisty mineral and spice flavors. Finishes chunky, with some fire, heat and bitter chocolate. Good but not as lively and precise as the great ones from Priorato.",Ceps Nous,87,27,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Pasanau Germans
89852,Spain,"Nice Tempranillo for $10. Paso a Paso opens with blackberry, boysenberry and other black-fruit aromas. But it's composed and doesn't smell artificial or candied. In the mouth, the wine is tannic, tight and brawny, with no shortage of berry and plum flavors. Big, generous and great for those looking for a lot of fruit and simplicity.",NA,87,10,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Paso a Paso
89877,Spain,"Slightly volatile and jammy, but still good for the price range. The nose is pungent and mildly prickly, but it settles in the long run. Like most RDDs, it's intense and jammy in the mouth, with concentration and flavors of raspberry, tomato, salad dressing and even chocolate. If all this sounds a bit scattered and all over the map, it is. But as a whole, the wine has composure, mouthfeel and varietal and regional character.",Miros,87,19,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Peñafiel
89922,Spain,"Round and lemony on the nose, with apple and minerality. The palate is juicy and fresh, with dry, angular pineapple and lemon flavors.

89935,Spain,"The first act of dried spices and light, dusty red fruit aromas is honest and subdued. The palate brings good weight and lightly leafy, tomatoey accents to red cherry and raspberry flavors. Light, dry and a little stemmy on the finish. Standard but hinting at elegant.",Crianza,86,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,El Coto
89938,Spain,"Fresh and fruity on the nose, and inviting for what it is: a basic Garnacha with color, spirit and lots of blackberry and plum flavors. The palate is tight and rubbery, but overall this is a fine value despite its short, simple finish.",Old Vine,86,11,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Garnacha,Monastir
90001,Spain,"Composed, balanced and with all the dots connected; this is what we like about basic, affordable Rioja. It's fleshy yet fresh, with snappy cherry and raspberry flavors accented by a wave of vanilla that continues onto the finish. Blends good flavors, weight and acidic crispness.",Crianza,87,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Finca del Marquesado
90003,Spain,"Pungent and sweaty smelling on first blush, almost suggesting Verdejo or Sauvignon Blanc. It remains oily and nettled on the nose, with sharpness. Sooner rather than later it softens, unveiling flavors of green melon, passionfruit and citrus. And the finish goes out with snap, orange and grapefruit. Potent for the variety.",NA,87,22,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Don Olegario
90012,Spain,"A little gritty and tough on the nose, with hard strawberry and kirsch aromas. The palate is voluminous and foamy, with flavors of burnt blood orange and grilled pink grapefruit. Yes, there's a hard, burnt element to the wine, but this being Pinot Noir from Penedès that's to be expected.",Brut Rosé,87,18,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Pinot Noir,Juvé y Camps
90033,Spain,"Mineral-driven and hard on the nose, this features toasty, smoky, chocolaty notes in addition to medicinal berry aromas. It feels juicy but also resiny and creamy, with plum and wood flavors that finish long.

90046,Spain,"This is modern in style and well stocked for an affordable Rioja.

It feels tight, warm and long on the finish.",NA,88,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Obalo
90052,Spain,"This producer knows how to do Verdejo right. Aromas of citrus, mineral and apple are lucid and fresh. It feels tangy and a touch citric, but not cutting, with lemon and tangerine flavors that set up a minerally, steely, refreshing finish. Best as an apéritif or with oysters or chilled shrimp.",NA,88,13,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Palacio de Bornos
90057,Spain,"Crusty on the nose, this has toast, mineral, leather, berry and cherry aromas.

Resiny vanilla, herb and peppery spice touches grace the finish.",Reserva,88,NA,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Mayor
90072,Spain,"Ginger ale and a touch of powdered sugar give this extra dry Cava its proper sweet aromas. The flavors are solid, if you like candied orange slices and lemon-lime soda. Shows good mouthfeel and more than adequate freshness. Perfectly competent given that it's $9.",Extra Dry,86,9,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Cristalino
90075,Spain,"The bouquet delivers some of that creamy, corn-like smell that many Cavas show. There is also cereal and citrus to the nose.

Shows some green bitterness on the finish.",Brut de Bruts,86,20,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Gran Rigau
90078,Spain,"Probably not a Cava for wine snobs. But who says all wines have to be super serious and complex? This one shows cured meat, tarragon, sweet tea and Muscat aromas, while the flavors are pure lychee and honeydew. Frothy and sugary, but that's the spumante style. Best with birthday cake, etc.",Spumante,86,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
90086,Spain,"From the Freixenet group of wineries, Vionta is clean but more neutral than we'd like to see. You won't be offended by the wine's green apple and lemon flavors, which are wet, fresh and zesty. But you might like a touch more refinement and dimension. A good wine, but a basic one.",NA,86,18,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Vionta
90087,Spain,"Gets off early with fresh tomato, spiced red plum, tobacco and vanilla aromas. The palate is fine but tight, with herbal fruit flavors, pepper, tomato and sharp acidity.

Not the sweetest or softest thing going, but good if you like Navarran wines and their patented herbal, red-fruit character.",Crianza,86,17,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo,Ochoa
90103,Spain,"This barrel-aged white Rioja is as close to Burgundy as you're going to find in Spain. It has a lot of oak throughout, but with vanilla, spice, cinnamon and more it works. Apple, baked citrus and resin from the barrel make it complex and food-worthy, and if you were to serve this with grilled or baked fish you could leave the Montrachet for next time. Imported by Maisons Marques & Domaines USA.",Capellanía,90,26,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Marqués de Murrieta
90108,Spain,"A deep and dense wine, with coconut and blackberry dominating the weighty, powerful bouquet. This is an organic wine with an explosive palate of berry fruit and plenty of juicy acidity to keep it fresh and healthy. Toast, chocolate and cola are the finishing notes, and overall it's a strapping wine to drink now thru 2013. Imported by Organic Vintners.",Clos del Music,90,60,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Pinord
90120,Spain,"Yeasty, briney and strange on the nose, this feels clunky, with oily citrus and nut-driven flavors. It's bitter on the finish, and it doesn't show much in the way of mouthfeel. A blend of Chardonnay and Macabeo.",Artemayor Brut Nature,82,38,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Dominio de la Vega

90135,Spain,"Medicinal and leathery, this has an iodine aroma that takes the luster off the fruit. It feels short and choppy, with medicinal, gritty flavors of vitamin, red berry and red licorice. Juicy but edgy; tasted twice.",Luzon Verde,82,9,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Bodegas Luzón
90136,Spain,"Intersting up front, with savory, roasted aromas of smoky plum and barbecue. It feels bullish and punishing, bearing monster tannins and heavy extraction, with a roasted, charred flavor that leads to an all-out resiny, burnt-wood-tasting finish.",6 Meses en Barrica,82,14,Central Spain,Uclés,NA,Tempranillo,Finca La Estacada
90138,Spain,"This smells reedy and scratchy, turning more herbal with time in the glass. Astringent acids create a sharp mouthfeel, and while the flavors include raspberry and strawberry, there's also a weedy component that picks up speed as the wine breathes.",NA,82,13,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,Gladium
90142,Spain,"This smells cheesy and tomatoey, with a woody accent. Clampy, resiny and drying on the palate, this has lean tea and cherry flavors that are complemented by a dull oak tone. The finish is minty and resiny tasting, but hollow in feel.",Old Vines Reserva,82,15,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Navarro López
90145,Spain,"Jammy and candied smelling, this has a green element akin to alfalfa or mint. It's clampy, tannic and high in acid, with raspberry and plum notes that offer an oak offset. The flavors turn tangy and sharp on the finish, even as a heavy vanilla flavor settles in.",Jaloco Roble,82,12,Central Spain,Ribera del Guadiana,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Medina

90185,Spain,"Attractive background aromas like nutmeg and licorice are taken down a notch by front-running bramble and pickled notes, while the palate is hard, tannic and spunky as it delivers lively cherry, raspberry and chocolate flavors.

90188,Spain,"Barrantes is always a full-bodied Albariño from one of Rias Baixas's warmest subzones. The nose on the '07 is of doughnuts and pastry, with sweet pear kicking in. The flavors are peach, apricot and ripe citrus fruits, and the finish is pithy and wide. Plods along a bit; could stand to be lighter and smoother in scope.",Pazo Barrantes,87,23,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Pazo de Barrantes
90195,Spain,"A warm and earthy wine with baked dark-fruit aromas covered in a blanket of fully toasted oak. This bruiser, like its brothers, is all-out Garnacha. It carries a stated 15.5% alcohol, and the flavors are of roasted black plum, blackberry and wood. More lively than the reserve-level wines from Alto Moncayo, but still hard, demanding and heavy. 500 cases made.",Veraton,86,27,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Alto Moncayo
90198,Spain,"Dusty and plump up front, with a hint of melon. The palate is round and easygoing, with moderate acidity supporting baked apple and melon flavors.

90218,Spain,"Broad, dark and meaty, with aromas of leather and beef broth. The palate comes on as bulky and tannic, but the flavors are full and deep even if they are also a touch soupy and meaty. Good for a 2008 midlevel RDD, but nothing to get excited over.",Embocadero,85,18,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Bodega San Pedro Regalado
90223,Spain,"Big and sort of disinterested for Albariño, with a clipped, citrusy palate that's choppy, salinic and green. There's green melon and minerality here, but for a new-vintage wine it seems middling in its focus and intensity.",NA,85,19,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Valmiñor
90224,Spain,"Recommended with caution. The sample this note is based on was weighty and smooth, with apple and floral notes and then an almosty buttery palate with baked apple and citrus flavors. Oddly, it's a soft, ripe wine that's fading and not showing much Sauvignon Blanc typicity.",NA,85,10,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Sauvignon Blanc,Spanish Vines
90225,Spain,"Starts with peppery, leafy aromas that morph toward dry and earthy. The palate, like with all of Torres' basic '07 wines, is crisp and acidic, which brings tang to the wine's red cherry and plum flavors. Spicy, peppery and fresh on the finish.",Sangre de Toro,85,11,Catalonia,Catalunya,NA,Red Blend,Torres
90301,Spain,"Seems more earthy and damp than you might expect, with minerally notes. Sort of fiery and rugged on the palate, with tough tannins and only modest roundness and richness for a reserva-level wine from a good vintage. Shows some bitter chocolate on the finish. Needs another year in bottle to show better.",Reserva,87,NA,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Protos
90308,Spain,"Minty black cherry aromas give it a solid opening, but there's also some mild cleanser and paint scents to the nose. The palate is basic, snappy, fresh and carries good weight, while the flavors are sweet, berry-oriented and softened by vanilla. A good Grenache with good balance.",Atteca Old Vines,87,16,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Garnacha,Bodegas Ateca
90335,Spain,"Chunky, jammy and full of blackberry and boysenberry aromas, this is lively but limited in mouthfeel, with wild berry and savory flavors. It feels pointed and short on the finish, but overall it's dark, full and well made.",Tinto Figuero 12 Crianza,88,29,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,García Figuero
90339,Spain,"Clean and fresh, this features largely neutral, mineral-driven aromas that hint at white fruit and melon. Citrus, particularly white grapefruit, is the lead flavor, while background notes of pith, melon and green banana make appearances. Fresh, crisp and nice on the finish.",Single Vineyard,88,20,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Finca de Arantei
90358,Spain,"Applesauce, lime and mineral aromas comprise the shy bouquet on this Cava. It feels round yet alive, with crisp apple and peach flavors. Citrus-driven acidity comes out on the finish.",Brut Reserva Made with Organic Grapes,88,19,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Marqués de Gelida
90359,Spain,"Firm, gritty aromas of minerally black cherry and plum precede a palate that sizzles with bold, scouring acidity. It tastes woody, resiny and reasonably fruity, with forceful acids creating a tangy, zesty finish. Drink 2013–2017.",FA 206 Vinyes de Coster,88,38,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Mas Igneus
90360,Spain,"The nose delivers a light but perceptible blast of sucking candy, children's vitamin and perfume aromas. The palate shows additional candied characteristics, but for the most part it's fresh and easy, with a good feel. Generic as a whole, but competent and satisfying.",Brut,86,12,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Conde de Subirats
90363,Spain,"The smell of honey and lemon-lime soda give this a basic but respectable opening. It's sort of foamy and plump in the mouth, with apple and green-herb flavors. Lacks a little touch but offers bouncy fruit and no overt faults. Imported by Winelink Imports.",Brut Nature,86,14,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Dibon
90366,Spain,"The neon pink color is a dead giveaway that Garnacha is the basis of this rosé. Smells spunky and quite fresh on the nose, with a touch of bubble-gum sweetness. Flavors of raspberry and cotton candy catch the tart and sweet sides of things, so overall it's offering a little of everything. Drink now.",Rosado,86,11,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Rosé,Ilurce
90368,Spain,"A little aggressive out of the chute, with a nose that's sort of raspy. The fruit on the palate is tangy and tastes like early picked nectarines with a lemon twist. Crisp and short, but very clean and focused.",Cordon Rosado Brut,86,12,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
90369,Spain,"Salmon-colored and dense, with aromas of clay, cherry and brown sugar. Pinot Noir-ish in its smoky, dried-berry palate and peppery finish. Robust, solid and with texture.",Rose Brut,86,8,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Cristalino
90370,Spain,"Age is beginning to show up on this gran reserva. It's a little raisiny and Sherried on the nose, while the palate is wiry but not exactly thin, with dry raspberry, pie cherry and plum skin flavors. Baked bean, caramel, vanilla and tobacco all play big roles on the finish, which is scouring and tight. Drink now; it's probably not going to improve with further age.",Viña Real Gran Reserva,86,56,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,CVNE
90372,Spain,"Aromas of cherry-chocolate and rubber are firm and a little closed. And such a bouquet doesn't really portend a flavor profile dominated by pink grapefruit and tight citrus. But that's really where this Cava rests: in the mouth, it's single-mindedly about pink grapefruit, which is fine if that's a flavor you like.",Brut Rosé,86,12,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Conde de Subirats
90373,Spain,"Savory and deep given the price, with dark color, obvious ripeness and even a touch of vanilla and mocha on the nose. Round in the mouth and immensely fruity, with plum and berry flavors blending with vanilla. Textured and medium-long on the finish. Good for everyday quaffing, especially in the cold fall and winter months.",Riscal 1860,86,9,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo,Riscal
90402,Spain,"Nothing if not stout and fruity. This is a big, modern Syrah with a mountain's worth of plum, berry and currant character on the nose, palate and finish. The acidity is a bit jagged and amplified, which creates some crispness, tension and pop. But overall it's a burly specimen that despite 20 months in oak does not taste woody. Drink or hold until 2012. Imported by Kobrand.",Pago Garduña,90,110,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Syrah,Abadia Retuerta
90422,Spain,"This is rusty in color, with burnt leaf and dried earth aromas. Drying and hard on the palate, it has an earthy, leafy set of strained red-fruit flavors. Bitter and rough on the finish.",Diego de Almagro,81,10,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,NA,Tempranillo,Pagos del Rey
90427,Spain,"A sappy wild-berry aroma turns mulchy with airing. The palate feels sharp and puckery, with very high acidity that creates short, tart, ultrajuicy raspberry and red plum flavors.",Crianza,81,15,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Red Blend,Finca Antigua
90430,Spain,"Spice and tire rubber aromas shadow hard, dry berry scents. It feels bumpy and scattershot, with a pasty, oaky flavor and fiery acidity. The finish is overly oaky and invasive.",Castell de Raimat,81,10,Catalonia,Costers del Segre,NA,Tempranillo,Raimat
90432,Spain,"Right from the start things are stretched thin. It smells raw and feels dilute, with flavors of sour plum and a bit of wood resin. Fiery and tart on the finish.",BT Tintorera,81,9,Central Spain,Almansa,NA,Garnacha,Bodegas Tintoralba
90433,Spain,"Cherry and plum aromas lead to a choppy, rubbery-feeling palate. It tastes soupy, herbal and briney.",NA,80,13,Levante,Utiel-Requena,NA,Bobal,Dominio de la Vega
90434,Spain,"Berry and plum aromas come with hints of smoke and asphalt. The very high acidity creates a shearing mouthfeel, and the flavors never evolve past tart red plum and cranberry.",NA,80,9,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,Rojo Mojo
90437,Spain,"This is on its last legs. It smells maderized, flat and candied, then feels heavy and drying. It tastes and smells old, finishing bitter.",Jaloco Rosado,80,10,Central Spain,Ribera del Guadiana,NA,Rosé,Bodegas Medina
90441,Spain,"Fondillón represents the pinnacle of red Spanish dessert wines, and the 1999 vintage just might make your jaw drop. Subtle but expansive on the nose, with a blend of baked dark-fruit and cinnamon aromas, it is liquid heaven in the mouth, with excellent balance and flavors of roasted plums, black cherry, nutmeg and chocolate. This is pure, structured and outstanding from start to finish. Drink now or hold in a proper cellar for another 10 or 20 years. 100 cases made.",Casta Diva Fondillón Sweet,97,88,Levante,Alicante,NA,Monastrell,Bodegas Gutiérrez de la Vega
90453,Spain,"Quite standard but that doesn't mean it isn't a good wine and doesn't fit a purpose. For regular, everyday Rioja this should not fail. It has nice cherry and plum aromas with a hint of rubber and tobacco. Licorice, plum, raspberry and brown sugar flavors work the balanced, controlled palate, while the finish is natural and unforced. 235,000 cases made.",Faustino VII,86,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Faustino
90457,Spain,"This ranks as a good no-frills white wine from central Spain. Viura is at its best when it's crisp, clean and tastes like apples and honeydew. And for the most part, that's exactly what this is. There's freshness and scour, but it's not acidic or sharp. Still, best to drink it as soon as possible.",NA,86,9,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Viura,Maximo
90461,Spain,"Yellow in color, with honeyed peach aromas. There is no indication of oak, but it probably went through extended lees aging, which explains the wine's richer melon, apricot and honey flavors. Almost Chardonnay-like in body and weight, but with more tropical, tree-fruit flavors and aromas. Drink immediately; it's on the way out.",Miros Alba de Miros,86,16,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Bodegas Peñafiel
90470,Spain,"Bramble and brine are present on the nose, and while 2005 was a very good vintage in Rioja, this wine brings a little less than expected. It's endowed with snappy red-fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry, and there's also vanilla and herbal notes. The feel is dry, medium-bodied and grabby, with a hint of stemmy snap.",Crianza,86,16,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Marqués de Cáceres
90473,Spain,"Can't call this an elevated or complex wine, but we can say that it's big and bold, with plum, berry and dill aromas. In the mouth, it's not overly vocal but it is fulfilling. Flavors of plum, vanilla and aged cheese are nice, while coconut comes up on the finish. A wine to drink without contemplation.",Crianza,86,14,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,El Circulo
90477,Spain,"A touch of volatility accompanies opening black fruit and plum aromas, while the palate brings both a raisiny essence and austere acidity that causes tartness. For basic Priorat, this is fine. But if you're looking for greatness, there isn't much to speak of. Overall, it's a good but regular wine, nothing more or less.",Negre,86,16,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Scala Dei
90478,Spain,"A perennial Best Buy, Sangre de Toro always delivers a quality red-wine experience that does not bowl you over. Here the aromas are light and jammy, with strawberry. The body is medium in weight and intensity, with pure but basic cherry, raspberry and plum flavors. Like all other parts of the wine, the finish is easy and clean, with carry-over flavors of berry fruit.",Sangre de Toro,86,10,Catalonia,Catalunya,NA,Red Blend,Torres
90608,Spain,"Opens with sweet fruit aromas, a whiff of oak and red candy, while the mouthfeeel is juicy and mostly fresh, with clean fruit flavors and more than adequate ripeness and sweetness. Fresh, composed and pleasant in the scheme of things.",Envite Crianza,87,22,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas San Prudencio
90612,Spain,"Reddish in color, with solid aromas of tire rubber, cherry and plum. The palate shows fine lift and balance, and the flavors of juicy, slightly pithy and bitter raspberry and plum are just right for Navarran Garnacha-based rosé. Drink soon with salads and finger foods.",NA,87,8,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Rosé,Vega Sindoa
90621,Spain,"Crisp, natural and lightly salinic on the nose, with medium weight, good freshness and solid peach and citrus flavors. This is a standard but nicely done Rioja rosé with a pithy finish and just the right edge to it. Drink liberally with appetizers and you shouldn't go wrong.",NA,87,9,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Rosé,Marqués de Cáceres
90626,Spain,"More basic and strained than prior wines from this producer. The nose is rubbery and cheesy at first, with leather and blackberry. Hard, tannic and acidic as well, and only a little softer with airing. Flavors are of snappy, tough cherry and berry, and the finish shows tannic bite. Could improve some with aging; now it's a tough go.",Ètim Old Vines,86,27,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Grenache,Agricola Falset-Marca
90629,Spain,"Kicks off with minty coconut aromas and prune, then a hint of creamy green. The palate shows proper acidity and tannin balance, so the framing for the wine's raspberry flavors is good. Grabby but fresh on the finish, with just enough grapey richness.",NA,86,12,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Garnacha,Finca Antigua
90647,Spain,"Roasted and fiery on the nose, this wine has red fruit aromas mixed with green, herbal notes. It feels racy and pumped up with acidity, which drives the wine's core flavors of red plum, herb and vanilla. It's fresh but slightly abrasive and herbal throughout. This is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah and Tempranillo, in descending order.",Aldonza Navamarín,88,59,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Red Blend,Dehesas y Viñedos de Navamarín
90654,Spain,"Earthy, inky, sweet and jammy on the nose, this brings just the right hint of raisin. It feels narrow and firmly tannic, with wide flavors of blackberry, prune, raisin and chocolate. It's loaded with flavor, but the mouthfeel is astringent and collapsed. A powerful country-style wine.",Viñas Viejas,88,15,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Garnacha,Punto y Coma
90656,Spain,"Active on the bouquet, this features mint, baking spice, clove and ripe berry aromas. It feels plump and round, with a mildly candied flavor profile that includes blackberry, herb, and nutmeg. It turns a little rooty on the finish, suggesting licorice nibs. A blend of 65% Garnacha and 35% Tempranillo.",La Vendimia,88,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Red Blend,Palacios Remondo
90660,Spain,"A touch scratchy and rough on the nose, with pepper and leathery fruit aromas. The palate keeps that edge while offering peppery berry flavors and oak. More tannic and woody than one might hope for, with lactic notes on the finish. Shows flashes but comes up average. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",Flor del Montgó Old Vines,85,NA,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Garnacha,Montgó
90661,Spain,"Silly name but pretty good wine. A tidal wave of cherry/berry aromas is authentic, natural, youthful and floral. The palate is just as bright and bouncy, with red fruit running away with things. A touch of mineral and chocolate at the end gives it some darkness to match the vibrancy.",NA,85,8,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Wrongo Dongo
90663,Spain,"Even though it's a sweet-styled Cava, the nose kicks up lemon and apple aromas that are familiar as can be. The palate, however, is quite sweet and supports the Semi Dry labeling. Candied but not sticky, with a slightly chalky finish.",Carta Nevada Semi Dry,85,9,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
90671,Spain,"Ultra purple and sort of gummy and confected. But it's also pretty solid in the mouth, with tannin instead of flatness holding things together. Tastes like sweet dark plums and candy, while a hint of black coffee darkness enters on the finish.",Viña Berceo Crianza,85,18,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Berceo
90672,Spain,"The Borsao brand is a bargain pioneer, and while the wines aren't $4.99 anymore they are still squarely “value” oriented. This rosé is fairly steely and fresh, with pithy grapefruit and nectarine flavors. Lean and peppery on the finish, and ready to be consumed right away.",NA,85,8,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Rosé,Borsao
90676,Spain,"Already in the twilight of its lifespan, this is a friendly rosé with a little wiggle and kick. The palate sits on ripe nectarine and pink grapefruit, while the finish offers pepper and spice. A little pithy but pretty good if you get at it soon.",NA,85,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Rosé,Tapeña
90710,Spain,"Big and dark, and it comes with no shortage of prune, blackberry, smoky oak and depth. A lusty flavor profile filled with blackberry, cola, clove and chocolate is stout and satisfying, while the dark finish sports licorice and bitter cacao. Forthright and chunky wine. Drink now into 2011. Imported by Fine Estates From Spain.",NA,89,17,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Red Blend,Can Blau
90740,Spain,"This is incredibly inviting on the bouquet due to aromas of leather, raisin, tea and mocha. It feels lifted, benefiting from the superb structure and tannins, while the flavors of leathery berry, coffee, toast and chocolate are outstanding. This is pure, deep, elegant and impeccably balanced Tempranillo. Drink now–2018.",Vendimia Seleccionada,94,69,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,García Figuero
90753,Spain,"More red than dark, with semisweet aromas of candy, strawberry and a bit of grassy green. The palate is easygoing and creamy, with milk chocolate and berry flavors along with overt wood-driven spice. Finishes with drying tannins, another wave of oak and just enough snap to keep it moving in the right direction. Good but not great by Priorat standards.",NA,86,23,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Los 800
90758,Spain,"Nobody should mistake this idiosyncratic Basque white wine for a bargain. At $25, you had better like steely, almost sour-style whites to justify going here. But if you can find the pleasure in Txakoli, then this one is good. It has peach and nectarine aromas, which are backed by tangy lemon and pineapple flavors. Naturally sharp and cleansing on the finish, and thus good for seafood tapas and the like.",NA,86,25,Northern Spain,Getariako Txakolina,NA,White Blend,Txomín Etxaníz
90760,Spain,"Young, jumpy and slightly candied, but that's just fine given the price range it's playing in. To get old-vines Garnacha for a song is not uncommon, yet this wine's thick, fruity palate goes beyond the norm. And with a round mouthfeel built on light-framed tannins, it's easygoing as can be. Drink now, but don't put it under the microscope.",Menguante,86,10,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Garnacha,Viñedos y Bodegas Pablo
90766,Spain,"Dusty and dry smelling, with apple and lettuce on the nose. Flavors of green apple are glazed with spice and cinnamon, while the finish leans on papaya and pretty good mouthfeel and texture. Very basic but solid. Drink now.",NA,85,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Viura,Montecillo
90768,Spain,"A little bit strange and unusual on the nose, with roasted meat, young oak, popcorn and only modest fruit aromas. The palate shows pointed cherry, chocolate and some mushroom, while the finish and mouthfeel are shy and not all that substantive. For basic Ribera this is good, but that's as far as it goes.",Vendimia Seleccionada,85,19,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Resalte
90771,Spain,"Dark and crusty on the nose, with cola, raisin and foresty dampness. The palate has wintergreen along with solid black cherry flavors, while accents of pepper and licorice give it a dark side. Finishes a bit grating and tannic, with espresso-like bitterness. Overall it's a good but not overwhelming wine from the hidden Valencia D.O. 70% Tempranillo and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon.",NA,85,15,Levante,Valencia,NA,Red Blend,El Molinet
90845,Spain,"Aromas of pure cherry are pointed but clean. That more or less describes the wine, which hits with sharp acidity but also good, slightly roasted flavors of cherry and plum. Finishes short, firm and a touch grating.",Tinto Lena,85,10,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Vinos de León
90849,Spain,"Stony apple aromas are mostly neutral and lead to a fleshy, semisoft palate with citrus, kiwi and notes of oxidation. Nice and easy but sort of plump and bland. The finish indicates that it's starting to bend and will break sooner rather than later. Drink now.",NA,85,12,Northern Spain,Valdeorras,NA,Godello,Verdes Castros
90863,Spain,"Whets the whistle with floral aromas of jasmine, talcum powder and banana. The palate is juicy, tight and citrusy in feel, with lime and kiwi flavors. A light wine for fresh foods and simple summer settings.",Sangre de Toro,85,10,Catalonia,Catalunya,NA,White Blend,Torres
90900,Spain,"Grapey and potent as Rioja crianzas go, with a medium-to-full-sized palate that's full of bright acidity and standard but solid berry fruit flavors. It's the slightest bit creamy and thick on the finish, but overall it's about as middle of the road as any wine on the market.",Crianza,86,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Finca Nueva
90906,Spain,"Very light in body, color and aromas. The nose is punchy and a bit sharp, and so is the palate, which offers crisp, bracing acids to highlight zesty, lean nectarine and tangerine flavors. Quite linear and citric, but experience with this wine says it shows best with food.",NA,86,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Rosé,Muga
90908,Spain,"Soda pop-like on the nose, with a clear reference to Sprite and 7Up. The palate is somewhat candied and simple, but it has good feel and the flavors of lemon-lime are likable. Mild on the finish, with flavors that extend from the lemon-lime bouquet and palate.",Brut,86,14,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Mistinguett
90913,Spain,"A chunky wine with compost, coffee and leather on the nose. The palate holds onto that chunkiness with clumsy flatness that goes with herbal plum and berry flavors. Airing allows it to unfold and find a better place, but always does it seem heavy and on the murky side.",Lealtanza Selección Especial Reserva,86,36,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Altanza
90915,Spain,"The opening of smoke, rubber and black cherry comes across as being dark and good. The palate holds form with lively cherry, plum and currant flavors and finally a medium-long, somewhat warm and meaty finish. Good for an everyday, no-frills Garnacha.",Viña Alarba Old Vines,86,10,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Grenache,Bodegas y Vinedos del Jalón
90919,Spain,"Starts out muddled and murky, and eventually settles on rich, raisiny and slightly stewed. Seeing that this is Toro, some overripeness is almost a given, and thus the black fruit and licorice flavors are expected. Finishes warm, toasty and short, with a candied hollowness.",Crianza,86,22,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tempranillo,Tardencuba
90922,Spain,"Piercing to start, with leathery, bacony and campfire aromas. Saturated, although healthy, if a bit hard and tannic. Flavors of bacon and clove are right up there with black fruit and syupy richness, and clove carries onto the finish. Needs time to breathe and unfold; 65% Garnacha and 35% Syrah.",Tinto Joven,86,17,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha-Syrah,Pagos del Moncayo
90929,Spain,"Opens with bright, popping cherry aromas that are straightforward, much like the rest of the show. The palate is regular and healthy in feel, with standard cherry and raspberry flavors. Finishes the slightest bit toasty and warm. Nice but basic Rioja.",Viña Zaco,86,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Bilbainas
90937,Spain,"This is dense yet fresh, with dark berry and mild earth aromas. It feels lively, forceful and solidly built, with blackberry, creamy chocolate, toast and spice flavors that are all in equal, balanced portions. Long and warm on the finish.",Aldeya,88,10,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Garnacha,Pago Aylés
90963,Spain,"A bit of forward oak comes across on the nose, while mocha and pretty good berry fruit keep things focused. Like most Navarran wines, this is snappy and “red” in character, with herbal tomato and plum flavors. Classic finishing notes of olive and dill close things out.",Selección Reserva,85,23,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Alconde
90968,Spain,"A typically reserved Navarran wine is what this is. The nose offers dry red fruit, spice and not much else. The palate is mildly citric and herbal, but there's enough cherry and leather to carry things to a medium-length   finish of dill, vanilla and spice. A nice and simple food wine.",Crianza,85,13,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Red Blend,Señorío de Sarria
90978,Spain,"A little creamy, waxy and scattershot, but also far more exotic and different than most $8 wines. This is barrel-fermented Viura, but the oak level is light and manageable. Flavors of papaya, melon and citrus are almost tropical in scope, and the finish is pretty fresh. Drink right away for maximum freshness.",Conde de Valdemar,85,8,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Viura,Bodegas Valdemar
90994,Spain,"Fresh, pure and minerally, with lime and peach aromas. This is a fine Viura that is lively, balanced and flavorful. The citrus and apple flavors ring true, and the mouthfeel isn't raw or jumpy. Instead, a mineral and chalk element smooths it out, and overall it sings. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",Cune Monopole,89,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Viura,CVNE
91016,Spain,"Full and clean, with a bright nose of cherry, plum and pepper. This is full-bodied, with extract and tannic bite.

Modern and ready to drink.",Manga del Brujo,89,21,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Red Blend,El Escocés Volante
91017,Spain,"Good value for a bear of a wine. It's 80% Tempranillo and 20% Cabernet, and it certainly has teeth. Stocky aromas of blackberry, bacon and tobacco are inviting, while the palate is saturated, tannic and full of black fruit, bacon and brown sugar. Finishes with weight and coffee/chocolate flavors. Not a shy wine.",NA,89,15,Levante,Valencia,NA,Tempranillo Blend,El Molinet
91018,Spain,"A big set of roasted aromas includes hints of smoke, mineral, bacon and black fruit. The palate is balanced and lifted by proper acidity, so the black-fruit flavors do not come across as heavy or cooked. Savory stuff, with vanilla and herb accents on a firm, long finish. Good structure; well-made wine.",Reserva,89,36,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinta Fina,Legaris
91019,Spain,"Even in a marginal vintage, you should expect a true and polished taste of Toro from Maurodos's Prima label. Blackberry, cherry and plum aromas are bonded by light balsam-like oak, while the palate is structured and delivers plenty of ripe black fruit. Chocolate and pepper on the finish seem right for the wine, which nails the Toro style even if it isn't a blockbuster. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Prima,89,24,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Maurodos
91049,Spain,"Modern and bulky, this has a lot of great things going on. It opens with aromas of mineral, graphite, sage and bold berry, with chewy, roasted black-fruit flavors. It's long, compact, chocolaty and spicy on the finish. Still not mature but it's drinkable—best from 2014 and on.",Clássic,93,89,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Carignan,Cims de Porrera
91055,Spain,"Hard to say who this wine is made for; must be the old schooler who likes lightness and elegance. Starts with gritty, rooty, mature aromas of tobacco and leaves, with red fruit scents mixed in. The palate is light but right, with elegant cherry and raspberry flavors that are not dark or heavy. Fades with vanilla and tobacco notes. Drink right away.",Chateldon Gran Reserva,85,36,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pinord
91058,Spain,"A wine with faults and a few positives. On the nose, it's roasted almost to the point of being overdone. It smells like baked fruit, roasted peanuts and tire tread. Doesn't sound great, does it? But in the mouth its more true and recognizable; flavors of tomato leaf, dried red fruit, vanilla and dill are known entities, while the finish is long and draped with even more dill weed. Drink now. This is not one to save.",Selección Reserva,85,21,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Ramirez de la Piscina
91063,Spain,"With lime, citrus and other linear aromas, this is nothing if not fresh. The palate is scouring and spritzy, and swishing it across the tongue will create a sudsy mouthfeel. Amid that there are tangy lime and pear flavors, and then a cleansing finish. Best with anchovies and other sea-based appetizers. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, Imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",NA,85,20,Northern Spain,Getariako Txakolina,NA,White Blend,Ulacia
91070,Spain,"Lots of color but quiet and shy, with only minimal expressiveness throughout. The palate offers just one level of baked-fruit flavors, but no variance or complexity. And in the end it's clean and solid, but more amorphous and monotone than you'd hope for given the price. 70% Monastrell and 30% Cab Franc is the blend; 160 cases made.",Minimum,85,75,Levante,Valencia,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Rafael Cambra
91073,Spain,"A little gaseous and funky on the nose, but that's common for inexpensive Garnacha. Once it unfolds, it deals saturated, chunky black-fruit flavors, a jammy mouthfeel and fatness on the finish. It isn't all that structured, but it doesn't lack for size. Maybe a touch green at its core, but given the price that's not a major fault.",Malena,85,10,Catalonia,Catalunya,NA,Garnacha,Torres
91147,Spain,"Kind of a downer given past performances of this label and the high quality of the '05 harvest. Seems overly roasted and earthy, with rubbery, drawn aromas that don't seem fully fresh. The palate is heavy, with cooked, leathery flavors of berry and fig. Finishes in similar fashion, with dull bitter flavors and leather.",Crianza,84,32,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Red Blend,Convento San Francisco
91150,Spain,"Waxy peach aromas seem slightly oxidized. It's round and citrusy on the palate, but in a monotone way that fades to pithy white fruits and mealy citrus. Shows some flashes of uniqueness and class; mostly it's wayward and slightly bitter.",Ad Libitum,84,40,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blanco,Juan Carlos Sancha
91153,Spain,"Sweet and mildly candied on the bouquet, and then it clamps down firmly in the mouth with hard Cabernet tannins and lightly herbal, candied flavors of medicinal black cherry. Decent but not special; finishes sticky and candied.",Rojo Granrojo,84,9,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Bodegas Navarro López
91162,Spain,"Dry, lightweight and peppery, but zesty, fresh and clean. The body is streamlined to the point of being lean, but the raspberry and cherry flavors, while also thin like a runway model, are crisp and legit. Tart, tasty and simple red wine.",Mediterranean Red,84,6,Catalonia,Catalunya,NA,Tempranillo-Merlot,René Barbier
91168,Spain,"Powerful but not real precise, especially as the earthy, tight nose unveils itself. The mouthfeel is tight, narrow and tannic, yet the flavors are big and meaty, and also sort of generic in terms of berry flavors. Medium-length and rough on the finish, with lasting acidic bite.",Canta Perdices,84,18,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Bodega San Pedro Regalado
91210,Spain,"Husky on the nose but mostly it comes across as wild, with jumpy, loud pear, melon and apple aromas. The mouth is spunky and all over the map, while flavors of tangy yellow fruits carry an acidic, herbal twinge and even a grassy quality. Lacks perfect poise but it can't be called timid or dull.",Pazo Barrantes,86,19,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Pazo de Barrantes
91217,Spain,"A simple but nice style of Ribera wine with open plum and berry aromas as well as snappy, juicy, fresh red fruit flavors. It's a touch biting and zesty at this point, but if you don't mind a little bite and zap it's perfectly good.",Crianza,86,NA,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Protos
91229,Spain,"Here's another good value red from Borsao. It's about as potent and packed a wine as you'll find for $7, and while it's jumpy, young and aggressive, it's also full of jammy black fruit, sticky extraction and firm tannins. A classic mouthfiller with spunk, color and heft.",Monte Oton,86,7,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Borsao
91257,Spain,"Smells more meaty and leathery than you might expect for a basic, young Tempranillo. But enough berry fruit sneaks through to make it a solid but narrow wine driven by red plum and other standard red-fruit flavors. Finishes fresh but lean.",NA,84,11,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo,Rivera de Castilla
91264,Spain,"A medicinal cherry aroma is solid despite its suggestion of plastic or latex. The mouthfeel is lively and edgy, offering raw tannins. Flavors of strawberry, plum and spice end in swirls of vanilla and cream. For a fresh, traditional Rioja, this is pretty good.",Viña Pomal Crianza,88,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Bilbainas
91265,Spain,"This is initially dark and earthy, with brandied cherry, leather and tobacco aromas. It feels complete and offers core acids to keep it feeling fresh. Flavors of black fruit and spice lead to a lasting finish with cola and cherry notes.",Glorioso Gran Reserva,88,35,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Palacio
91276,Spain,"Bold berry aromas charge forth in a clean, pointed fashion. This feels firm and solid, with no obvious flaws and a dark flavor of blackberry that's offset by notes of rooty licorice and sweet brown sugar. Lengthy and fresh on the finish.",Roble,88,14,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Toriles
91326,Spain,"Rooty and earthy smelling, this has aromas of leather, cassis, tobacco, dried cheese and cola. It feels rich and nicely textured, with firm but friendly tannins that set up tobacco, coffee, mocha and roasted berry flavors. It's chocolaty in an uncanny way on the finish. Drink now through 2018.",Expresión,93,70,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Alidis
91381,Spain,"Quite ripe on the nose, such that raisin and sweetness are front and center. Saturated in the mouth, but as a whole it's a bit flabby and, for the most part, it's neither here nor there. Flavors of plum and berry tilt to the dark side, while the finish is short but inoffensive.",Conde de Valdemar Crianza,85,14,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Valdemar
91383,Spain,"After an initial blast of earth and lettuce, this Cabernet finds some of its fruity essence. But still, it has persistent green notes that interfere with the wine's candied black fruit component. Finishes tannic and slightly clampy, with decent length and a mix of cassis, cherry and herbs. Classic Old World Cabernet from the Penedès.",Clos Maset Selección Especial,85,36,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon,Vallformosa
91396,Spain,"Dark and a touch murky, with earthy aromas of black cherry, leather and forest floor. The palate is well sized and feels healthy, while the flavors of plum and blackberry are slightly herbal. Shows pop, length and some bitterness on the finish. A regular wine for regular occasions.",NA,84,9,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Maximo
91404,Spain,"L. A mostly clean wine that hints at earth and leather but settles on basic red fruit. The palate shows mild, manageable snap and sharpness, while the palate deals flavors of red fruits, rubber and leather. Lean and clean, but basic as they come.",Tinto Lena,84,11,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Vinos de León
91406,Spain,"Not a lot of pop or life to the nose. What there is, however, is mostly light, herbal and pickled. Flavorwise, this shy wine settles on dry cherry and herbs, while the finish is rooty and leafy. Elegant in some ways, but our bet is that it's a little too weak and green for most palates.",Chateldon Reserva,84,17,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pinord
91449,Spain,"Pungent and grassy on the nose, with a strong nettle and green herb character. The palate is soft and playful, with pithy white fruit flavors and then a soda-like dry finish. Plump, wayward and a bit green overall.",NA,84,24,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Sauvignon,Reina de Castilla
91465,Spain,"Tan-gold in color, with a mustardy, somewhat rustic bouquet that's salinic and short on snappy fruit. The palate is chunky, with melon and apple for flavors. Seems low on pulse; the bet here is this was better six months ago and is now in decline.",NA,84,15,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Serra da Estrela
91467,Spain,"Smells peppery and dark, yet the body is crisp and zingy due to sharp acidity. Flavors of raspberry and cherry skins run fast, while the finish is acid-washed and quick, with a lasting bit of herbal flavor and tartness.",Sangre de Toro,84,11,Catalonia,Catalunya,NA,Tempranillo,Torres
91515,Spain,"Mildly earthy, leathery and light in color, with rooty aromas and tree bark on the nose.

Dry on the finish and good for everyday consumption.",Glorioso,86,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Palacio
91544,Spain,"Fresh-cut oak is front and center on this now-aging blend of Monastrell and Merlot. There's a green, almost cheesy accent to the nose, which is followed by generic plum flavor. Always resiny and creamy due to the oak, with some prune to the finish.",Enciro Monastrell Merlot,84,10,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,El Bully
91552,Spain,"Mildly raw and reduced, but at $6 expectations shouldn't be too high. In the mouth, it's tangy and light, with zingy strawberry/raspberry flavors that have some scour. Bland but lively.",NA,83,6,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Casa Solar
91555,Spain,"Raw and rough more than flush or lush. The nose deals mildly pickled red-fruit aromas in front of a tight, acidic palate that tastes of pie cherries.

91556,Spain,"Fizzy and foamy and aggressive. To give it a frame of reference, it is similar to Brachetto or Frascati from Italy, but it's clumsy on the palate and tastes too much like red licorice and candied fruit to be taken too seriously. Also a bit cloying on the finish. Imported by National Distributing Co., Inc.",Reynal Vino de Aguja,83,10,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Rosé,Pinord

Oaky on the finish, it has a good set of outgoing flavors and length.",Ibéricos Crianza,88,21,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Soto de Torres
91575,Spain,"Dense and concentrated on the nose, this features blackberry and black cherry aromas, with hardly any perceptible oak.

It's baked in flavor and gritty in feel as it finishes.",NA,88,17,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Garnacha,Picos Pardos
91577,Spain,"Earth, cola, berry, toast and leather aromas share the bouquet. The palate is narrow and pinched by firm tannins, while the flavor profile deals a mix of herb, toast and plum.

91582,Spain,"Apart from its note of fresh apple and hint of juniper, the nose is fairly neutral.

91596,Spain,"Covers all the principle bases via aromas of ripe dark fruit, bacon, spice and herbs. The palate is a bit soft but it's serious, with raspberry, cherry and plum flavors.

91600,Spain,"Here's a bright, forward, no-issues Garnacha that shows the upside of Calatayud and the grape in general. It's a touch raw and racy, but otherwise it's a nice wine with forward cherry flavors and a lightly charred, earthy finish. Pointed and racy, which is what you want from Spanish Garnacha.",La Multa La Revancha,88,12,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Garnacha,El Escocés Volante
91602,Spain,"Big on the nose, with regionally typical aromas of mineral, black fruit and herbs.

Imported by Grapes of Spain.",NA,88,41,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Genium Celler
91610,Spain,"Expressive white wine from the high plains of central Spain. Pie Franco is one of the more forward, high-quality wines from Rueda. It's 100% Verdejo and thus it sizzles with green apple, melon, citrus and celery aromas and flavors. Almost like dry 7Up in the mouth, with spritz, zest and persistence. Drink now. Imported by Frontier Wine Imports.",Pie Franco,88,24,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Blanco Nieva
91621,Spain,"This smells like orange marmalade. It feels smooth and creamy, but not terribly thick due to fine acidity, with flavors of orange, honey, peach and spice.

91625,Spain,"This is a serious Toro wine with smooth, dark, leathery aromas along with hints of wintergreen, licorice and berry pastry. It feels rich and layered, with complex flavors of licorice gum drop, nutmeg, chocolate and blackberry. Almost decadent but not over the top or too tannic. Drink now–2016.",NA,92,75,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Quinola
91634,Spain,"Fresh, floral and not overbearing on the nose, this has red berry and cassis aromas, with no interference from oak or too much extraction.

91654,Spain,"Violet as all get-out, with a nose that initially smells like bug juice. This is all about sweet, youthful fruit, so if you're looking for sophistication at bargain- basement prices you're shopping in the wrong place. What you will get is blackberry fruit, sweetness and gummy tannins. In the grand scheme of things it's just o.k., but for $6 you should not expect more.",NA,84,6,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,Campos Reales
91655,Spain,"Aromas of black fruits and licorice start things in a good direction, but over time it turns more pruney and raisiny. for a dark, extracted wine the palate is clangy and jumpy, with cherry and herbal plum flavors. Firm and medium-long on the finish, with a lasting herbal essence.",Old Vines Crianza,84,13,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Navarro López
91658,Spain,"Despite showing forced sweetness, this Catalonian blend always delivers in its price category. There's dusty lemon-lime and powdered sugar aromas and flavors along with papaya and green melon. It's never going to be a sophisticated white but it does get the job done for $5.99. And because of that there will always be a market for René Barbier Mediterranean White.",Mediterranean White,84,6,Catalonia,Catalunya,NA,White Blend,René Barbier
91659,Spain,"Fairly green on the nose, with a bit of brandied black fruit and kirsch. The palate is on the thin side but not grating, while the flavors center around snappy cherry, raspberry and tomato. Turns toward vegetal on the midpalate while not entirely going Martian green, yet it's more dilute and wan than we'd like to see, even for a 2002.",Reserva,84,18,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Rentas de Fincas
91665,Spain,"Carbonic maceration gives this Rioja a candied, somewhat odd set of aromas and flavors. It is mildly cheesy and sweet on the nose, with powdered cinnamon poking through. In the mouth, it shows even more candied cherry and raspberry, but also red licorice. Nothing overly bad about it, but still it tastes and smells a bit artificial.",Tinto Joven,84,16,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Luis Alegre
91675,Spain,"Clear as crystal up front, and then come flavors of lemon and green apple. There is almost no overt sweetness to it; it's quite acidic and sharp, which is common for the Hondarrabi Zuri grape from Northern Spain. As might be expected, green apple and lime control the austere finish. Good but very narrow in scope.",Table Wine,84,12,Spain Other,Vino de Mesa,NA,Hondarrabi Zuri,Kurmisti
91679,Spain,"Mildly sugary on the nose, with creamy flavors of papaya mixed with grass. The acidity is spiky and the finish sort of scouring. Not a lot of depth, body or pizzazz, and it seems as though maybe some oak was thrown at it.",Creu de Lavit,84,15,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Xarel-lo,Segura Viudas
91810,Spain,"For a higher-priced wine, this has some issues. The nose is heavy and murky, with leathery, baked aromas. In the mouth, it's somewhat choppy and acidic, thus punctuating the cherry tomato portion of the earth-and-leather flavor profile. Lingering oak accents the finish, which is zesty and leans toward sour.",Flor de Lasierpe Viñas Viejas,85,22,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Garnacha,Dominio Lasierpe
91817,Spain,"Rusty in hue, with mature, slightly old aromas of leather, gym bag, dried leaves and mature berry. The palate has depth and concentration, while the flavors are herbal and run toward baked black cherry and tobacco. Caramel and mature fruit flavors vie for control of the roasted finish.",Viña Centuria,85,17,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra del Bajo Aragón,NA,Garnacha,Bodegas Tempore
91828,Spain,"A clean, nice, regular Tempranillo with normal black cherry and berry aromas that offer hints of rubber and bacon. The palate is tannic and grabby but balanced for the most part, with pure, basic blackberry and cherry flavors. Modest in its scope, but fresh and untainted.",Organic Wine,85,12,Levante,Utiel-Requena,NA,Tempranillo,Spartico
91830,Spain,"Garnacha-Cabernet Sauvignon is the blend and it's showing some age. The nose is a little heavy and murky, and so is the palate. Flavors of melon and papaya are more plump than zesty and driven. Falls rather flat on the finish. Wait for the 2008.",NA,83,8,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Rosé,Vega Sindoa
91835,Spain,"All over the map. The nose offers toast offset by gym sweat, while the palate is both tangy yet pickled, with zingy orange flavors. The wine flows across the tongue but leaves a bit of citrus rind and vinegar. Not bad per se, but has some weak links. Imported by Winelink Imports.",Demi Sec,83,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Dibon
91836,Spain,"Big in color, with meaty, rubbery aromas that seem reduced and gaseous. The palate is black and toasty, but sort of rubbery. Burnt toast, black coffee and some bitterness control the finish. More colorful and big than flavorful and complete.",Vino Joven,83,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Lar de Sotomayor
91844,Spain,"A bit too rubbery and gassy to qualify as “clean,” with leafiness running the bouquet. The palate is sort of flat, with raisin, baked cherry and prune flavors. It's on the borderline of being stewed.",Tinto,83,9,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Agustín Cubero
91848,Spain,"Not super fruity. Instead it's a generic, racy specimen with lots of zap, kick and zest but not much style, warmth or fruit. Shows fiery flavors and a tight, driving finish. Expect many 2007s, including this one, to be on the miserly side.",NA,83,11,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Campellares
91850,Spain,"As a young wine, this is bold, dark, crusty and slightly out of joint. There are salty, balsamic flavors along with muscular berry notes, and then butter and other barrel-driven flavors on the finish. It's chunky bordering on huge, with balance and integration issues. Maybe a little better in six months.",Saludo,83,11,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Luis Gurpegui Muga
91852,Spain,"Gummy, pasty and sweet, with no real elegance or finesse. It's simply a dark, candied wine that's pure tutti-frutti. And the feel is more narrow than one might hope for given the wine's immense color and body.",El Chaparral Old Vine,82,13,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Grenache,Vega Sindoa

91860,Spain,"With dusty apple and mineral aromas, this feels healthy and plump, with apple, pear and lime flavors that sit in front of a citric and mildly green finish. Good and normal as Rueda wines go.",NA,87,13,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Egeo
91872,Spain,"Cedar cigar box and berry aromas become significantly more charred and toasted upon airing. It feels good, with plum, berry and plenty of burnt toast in the flavor package. It finishes dark and spicy, with a leftover burnt note.",Glorioso Crianza,87,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Palacio
91876,Spain,"This is mellow upfront, but it also has solid plum and berry aromas. On the palate it's grabby but good, with tough tannins that support dark plum and savory notes. Chewy and chocolaty on the finish, it has a mossy accent and firm leftover tannins.",Tinto 6 Meses en Barrica,87,20,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Alidis
91877,Spain,"Varietally correct on the nose, this has green apple, grapefruit and floral aromas. It feels basic, tangy and linear, with notes of melon, citrus and a dry, crisp finish that's mildly briny and a touch bitter.",NA,87,13,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Legaris
91886,Spain,"Likable from the start, with black fruit, baking spice and exotic sandalwood notes, this is firm and drying in feel, with a blend of dark berry, toast and peppery spice flavors.

91896,Spain,"Montecillo's first effort with Albariño is perfectly crisp and pleasant. The nose offers pure citrus and tropical fruit, the feel is even and balanced, and the flavors are dry and veer toward apple and green melon.

92033,Spain,"A noticeable step down from the 2005 Volver. This vintage is gangly and quasi out of control. At 14.5% alcohol, it's very big. And the aromas of shoe polish, burnt rubber, cola and vinegar are almost volatile and aggressive. Finishes edgy, sort of tannic and oily. Seems like the producer went straight for power and size while forgetting about balance.",NA,83,16,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Volver
92036,Spain,"Generally speaking, this a neutral wine that makes no impression. It shows pine and generic citrus on the nose, followed by equally generic apple and orange flavors.

92039,Spain,"As a fan of almost everything O. Fournier puts in the bottle, I'd say this value-oriented wine needs work. For starters, it mixes Zinfandel-like blueberry fruit with green, weedy aromas. The palate holds onto that green essence while also tossing out rhubarb, tea and carob flavors. Lacks the ripeness and structure as it should have, even at this modest price.",Urban Ribera Roble Red Wine,83,14,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Red Blend,O. Fournier
92042,Spain,"Rubbery but fresh smelling, with sharp acidity that creates big-time juiciness but also an angular feel. Tastes of zippy, tangy red fruits that are crisp and sizzle away. Gets a bit more deep and earthy on the finish.",Coronas,84,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Torres
92056,Spain,"Quite strange and funky smelling, with uncommon grass, floral, hickory and blueberry aromas. The palate feels fine but has a sweet, faux-weedy core flavor that's offset by candied berry flavors. Tastes of licorice and lactic creaminess on the finish.",Rojo Granrojo,83,9,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Bodegas Navarro López
92069,Spain,"Funky and smelling of pine and tarragon. That aromatic sharpness carries straight to the palate, where the feel is narrow and the flavors are short and tangy, with little to no big-time berry fruit. Simply an acceptable underperformer that's tough and sharp.",Barrica,83,19,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Finca La María
92105,Spain,"Aromas of pine, rubber and rhubarb are austere, and so is the rest of the wine. The palate is run by acidity, which is sharp and scouring. Flavors are tart and underdone, with pie cherry and red raspberry. Sheering but admittedly cleansing, with surprising sourness.",Capricho,85,20,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Garnacha,Cruz de Piedra

92110,Spain,"Quite an oaky wine, with aromas of BBQ, hickory, roasted plum and spice. The body is full but scratchy, with additional oak manifesting itself in the form of baked, rooty, vanilla flavors that override the wine's simple but quiet fruit content.

92122,Spain,"For an '04 reserva, this wine is more edgy, grabby and high in acid than expected. The nose shows old world leather, spearmint and smoked meat more than vibrant fruit, yet the palate is tangy, citric and tastes of red raspberry and plum. Slightly more creamy on the finish, but still it remains scratchy.",Reserva,85,29,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Vallobera
92131,Spain,"A different breed of cat. The nose is akin to nail polish and sweet perfume, while the palate is super simple and doesn't rise much above liquid candy. Not awful but not challenging or refined. Has a lasting simple jamminess that isn't elevating.",Old Vine Seleccion,82,9,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Mirone

92140,Spain,"Tobacco, spice and cranberry aromas mix with nutty leather and sweat. This is a tangy, choppy wine with more tomato and citrus flavor than ripe berry fruit.

92143,Spain,"A little jammy up front, but mostly this is dull and bland, with generic citrus-inspired flavors and some bitterness late. Can't see this really helping out food or standing alone as an apéritif.",Rosé,82,6,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Casa Solar
92144,Spain,"Mami Mia, this is heavy stuff. The nose on this Garnacha-Graciano mix is muddled and rubbery, while the palate is saturated but murky. Finishes almost salty, with a hint of the veggies. A loud wine that doesn't really say anything.",NA,82,13,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Garnacha-Graciano,Casita Mami
92150,Spain,"No Time is the name but unfortunately there's no substance and no richness. As a whole, this Garnacha smells of bramble and pickle, while the palate is fresh and bouncy but sour.",Garnacha Cepas Viejas,81,11,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Garnacha,No Time
92152,Spain,"Despite basic strawberry and red licorice aromas, this wine is decidedly tart. It hits with snappy nectarine flavors and then turns citric and finishes up sour. Doesn't offer much rosé pleasure; makes you wonder what's the point.",Rosé,81,11,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo,Rivera de Castilla
92154,Spain,"Flat and loamy on the nose, and then slightly floral. There is not much going on here; the palate offers distant strawberry flavors accented by pickle, and the finish is thin, tangy and hints at tomato. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",Excelsus,81,23,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Viña Herminia
92157,Spain,"This wine doesn't do much for Navarra's reputation as prime Spanish rosé country. It's a little burnt and acrid, with weak and muddled raspberry and pickle flavors. Finishes dry as a soda cracker.",Rosado,81,10,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Rosé,Señorío de Sarria
92170,Spain,"This is heavy and raisiny, with ripe earth and mineral aromas that are suggestive of Port. It feels loaded and scratchy, with licorice, prune and pepper flavors that finish short and with some heat. A bullish style to drink now.",8 Meses,87,15,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Cyan
92172,Spain,"Bits of grass and green tobacco infiltrate the otherwise sturdy and solid nose on this Tempranillo-based blend that includes Merlot, Cabernet and Syrah.

The finish turns leafy, chocolaty and herbal.",Aldonza Pisces,87,30,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Red Blend,Dehesas y Viñedos de Navamarín
92181,Spain,"Satinela has been on the upswing in recent years as it has become more complex. This vintage smells of lime, mineral and dusty apple. It feels fresh and right for the style, with Bartlett pear, lime and dry spice flavors.",Satinela Medium-Sweet,87,9,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Marqués de Cáceres
92182,Spain,"Dense and dark, this has earthy, crusty berry aromas and a sprinkle of herb on the nose. It hits with aggression but settles down nicely to offer raspberry, plum and savory herb flavors. Lively acidity allows for a long finish.",Selección Especial,87,15,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Garnacha,Marqués de Montañana
92186,Spain,"Citrusy aromas suggest orange juice and grapefruit pith. This feels balanced, with apple, papaya, melon and banana flavors that feed into a sweet-tasting finish that's slightly mealy in feel and flavor. Good and tasty, but drink immediately.",NA,87,14,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Naia
92215,Spain,"With mineral, apple and peach aromas, this gets off on the right footing. The palate is zesty and acidic, with a tangy set of apple, citrus and mineral flavors. Controlled heft, weight and spritz on the finish make it a solid bet. Look for the weird blue bottle and take it from there. Imported by W.J. Deutsch & Sons.",NA,88,25,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Mar de Frades
92219,Spain,"Good and lusty, with dark aromas of kirsch, chocolate, shoe polish, burnt oak and perfume. And while it may lack some focus, the palate is flush with ripe black fruit touched up by wood spice, pepper and herbs. Finishes generous and solid, with olive and savory herb notes. Drink now; 16,800 cases made. Imported by W.J. Deutsch & Sons.",Limited Edition,88,17,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Ramón Bilbao
92227,Spain,"Dark, compact and black, with graphite and growling blackberry aromas. Feels tight and drawing but serious and structured, with black fruit, chocolate, toast and spice flavors. Blackened as well on the finish, with mint and toast. Hold until 2015.",Demencia,91,65,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Demencia de Autor
92317,Spain,"Fairly flat on the nose, and also innocuous on the palate. Flavors of green melon and nectarine are modest at best, and while the mouthfeel is decent, the overall character of the wine isn't that exciting. Finishes pithy, citric and mealy. Yet another mediocre Navarran Chardonnay.",NA,83,13,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Chardonnay,Señorío de Sarria
92321,Spain,"Clean plum and berry is the opening act, but after initial black-fruit and spice aromas there is only an underdeveloped set of flavors that run sassy, sour and stretched. The feel is decidedly tart, while the finish is more acidic and less friendly than most varietal Monastrells. 400 cases made.",Uno,83,40,Levante,Valencia,NA,Monastrell,Bodegas Rafael Cambra
92322,Spain,"Color and mouthfeel are the highlights of this exceedingly green wine. Try as we might to figure out why, this is one of the more vegetal wines we've tried from Rioja. It's green-bean city on the nose, and the flavor profile is dominated by tomato, herbs and bell pepper. Think 1990s Chilean Merlot, early Super Tuscans or New Zealand Cabernet and you will know what we mean by “green.”",Inspiración Valdemar Colección Varietales,83,65,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Valdemar
92328,Spain,"Ku Dé Ta is one of these new “global” brands with wines from Argentina, Spain, Chile, etc. This Tempranillo is decidedly stemmy and burnt.

Not the type of wine that will improve. 8,000 cases made.",NA,83,10,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,Ku Dé Ta
92330,Spain,"Cambra's wines all seem sheer and tannic. This blend of Cabernets Sauvignon and Franc is funky at first, with clamshell, cheese and sweat aromas. In the mouth, it is all over the map, with short black-cherry flavors, lasting tartness and overt tannins. More shallow and hard than deep, rewarding and balanced.",Dos,83,30,Levante,Valencia,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc,Bodegas Rafael Cambra
92335,Spain,"Red fruit, sucking candy and milk chocolate cover the bouquet, but the palate is sharp and raw, with spiky, semisour raspberry and cherry flavors. There isn't much to this wine. It's sharp, edgy, elastic and lean. On the plus side, it's clean.",See Red,82,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo-Shiraz,Tempra Tantrum
92342,Spain,"Waxy, peachy aromas are less than fresh, and the palate follows that lead via soft, pithy flavors of orange and melon. Shows little grip or structure for Godello and the finish fails to bring it home with kick or pop. Already past its prime. Tasted twice.",Gotín del Risc,83,14,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Godello,Abad
92353,Spain,"Smells earthy, murky and a little raisiny, and then in the mouth it scratches with grating tannins in support of floral cherry and tart red fruit flavors. Finishes sort of hollow and sour; standard issue at best.",Viñas Viejas,83,18,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Milcampos

92415,Spain,"Almost red in color, with dusty aromas that mix in a blast of latex and dried cherry notes. The wine is made from organically grown Bobal grapes, and it offers tang and bite along with crisp flavors of plum skins, raspberry and citrus. Almost sour, but not. A solid quaffer for the price.",Albero Bobal,85,6,Levante,Utiel-Requena,NA,Rosé,Iranzo Fields
92422,Spain,"A standard Riojano red with crisp cherry aromas followed by a zesty, slightly tart palate that carries punchy cherry fruit, acidity and little nuance or character. Tastes a tiny bit sour by today's measurements, but it's still pretty good for being crisp and acid-driven.",Don Román,85,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Marques de Tomares
92425,Spain,"Slightly vinegary on the cherry-laden nose, with a mild but persistent briney character. The palate is high in acid, leading to some scour, but the flavors of plum and berry, while generic, are pretty good. Finishes with hints of toast, pepper and spice. Solid enough for $8.",NA,84,8,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Ermita San Antonio
92435,Spain,"A dud given that this is the winery's top effort. It's green and vegetal, with ashtray aromas. More like salad than wine. Not too many wines these days are blatantly bell peppery, but this is.",Reserva Especial,80,40,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Red Blend,Señorío de Sarria
92466,Spain,"This is as basic as Albariño gets, with aromas of sweet apple and pear. It feels round and a bit soft, with fleshy peach and dry melon flavors.

92474,Spain,"Leather and berry aromas are welcoming and veer toward mint. It feels solid and textured, with lightly oaked, earthy flavors of meaty berry and vanilla.

92499,Spain,"What a monster this is. Aromas of roasted meat, compost, leather, berry and plum give it a rugged bouquet, while the superripe palate is big as sin and loaded with ultrasweet blackberry, soy and peppery flavors. Succulent, chocolaty and dark, it's like an earthquake in your mouth. Expensive for what you get, and recommended solely for fans of huge, modern wines.

92509,Spain,"More familiar and less unusual than prior vintages. This wine deals typical, upright lemon, lime and tropical fruit aromas backed by green apple and lemon-based flavors.

92521,Spain,"Composed and not the least bit pushy or punishing on the bouquet, this has gorgeous berry and spice aromas.

92580,Spain,"Quite green and also raisiny, which doesn't really compute seeing that one indicates underripeness and the other overripeness. But throw both together and you get a wine that's not all that pleasing and seems to be striving for equilibrium. Gummy, green and thick-tasting in the mouth. A hard wine to get excited about.",Cupatge +3,82,18,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Red Blend,Finca Mores
92581,Spain,"Wax and peach-pit aromas give it a decent opening act, but the palate is dull and totally without a future.

92594,Spain,"A little strange and unusual on the nose, with a mix of grass, citrus and corn-like aromas.

92605,Spain,"So this is what Chardonnay, Macabeo and Sauvignon Blanc amount to when thrown together. The Three, or “Las Tres” if you prefer, is grabby and mealy, with thick, unfocused citrus flavors and then apple skins and bitterness on the finish. Too strange to rate higher. Already fading.",Las Tres,81,22,Levante,Utiel-Requena,NA,White Blend,Chozas Carrascal

92658,Spain,"Mild lime and mineral aromas draw interest, but the wine's palate is medium spritzy and sour, with sharp, lemony flavors and a dilute feel.

92702,Spain,"Sweet and fiery on the nose, with piercing aromas that burn right up your nasal passages. The palate is pinched and super tannic, with biting flavors of black licorice, blackberry and cola. Could be better with a softer, smoother mouthfeel but seeing that this is an '04 with six years behind it, it isn't going to soften up much.",Gran Dama de Toro,84,45,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Fariña
92703,Spain,"Smells a little too much like berry candy and cough syrup to win you over, and the palate is kind of flat and chunky as well as thick with creamy berry fruit. Points of acidic bite give it life, but things are brought back down on the finish with green, creamy oak notes.",Inspiración Valdemar,84,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Valdemar
92710,Spain,"Quite candied and jumpy on the nose, what some might call bug juice. Having spent six months in American oak, it's tight and tough on the palate, with fresh, juicy acidity that's a bit scouring. Tastes much like milk chocolate and candied fruit.",Roble,84,NA,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Protos
92713,Spain,"Begins with pasty, lactic aromas and heavy fruit. The palate is both big and clumsy, with sharp acidity amid bulk leading to choppy plum and medicinal cherry flavors.

92720,Spain,"Jammy, dark and reduced, with breadth along with leather and compost aromas. The palate is leathery, funky and medicinal, with viscosity and creamy berry flavors. Has richness and body but the flavors and congruety are sketchy until you remember that it costs but $7.",NA,84,7,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,Venta Morales
92726,Spain,"Neon pink in color, with heavier aromas that split time between chemical and candied. The palate is a bit awkward and heavy, with jumbled flavors of pomegranate juice, cherry and strawberry. Loses focus as it moves along, and finishes with a slightly bitter aftertaste.",Conde de Valdemar Rosado,84,9,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Rosé,Bodegas Valdemar
92728,Spain,"Simple at best early on, with leathery, rustic aromas and a truly basic set of flavors.

92767,Spain,"This smells stalky and leafy, with a baked element. It shows tomato-driven acidity and red-leaning flavors of cranberry, tomato and raspberry that are touched up by notes of oak-based vanilla and dill. Tomato and tobacco flavors are key to the finish.",Crianza,87,26,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Peña Roble

92915,Spain,"Two years in a row this has been a subpar wine. Mealy nectarine aromas are barely adequate, while the palate is sour and finishes bitter. Not a foul experience, but unexciting and not really worth a look.",NA,80,10,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Sauvignon Blanc,Analivia
92972,Spain,"Neon purple in color, young and jumpy, but hey, that's what simple Garnacha from this part of Spain is all about.

Beautifully crafted and with a nice red fruit element courtesy of 15% Graciano to go with old vines Tempranillo. Drink from 2012–2021.",Aurus,94,247,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Finca Allende
93302,Spain,"Starts with tough, almost harsh green aromas on the nose, but with time it settles on herbs and tobacco. The palate is fresh but a touch spiky and grabby, with herbal plum and berry flavors. Solid mouthfeel and length make it worthwhile even if it's herbal and slightly green tasting.",La Cantera,84,8,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Garnacha,Castillo de Monjardin
93303,Spain,"Opens with vinaigrette and balsamic notes along with leather and black fruit aromas. The palate is soft and muddled, with soupy, stewy flavors and a jagged, candied finish. Seems to struggle for balance, which is a common flaw in many Toro wines.",Carodorum Tinta de Toro Crianza,84,35,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Bodega Carmen Rodríguez
93315,Spain,"Sweet, plummy and unrefined on both the nose and palate. This is nothing more than simple juice that isn't terrible. It's grapey, sweet and tart, with an edgy bit of tang to the finish. Regular at best; subpar if you're being critical.",Peromato,83,9,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Fariña
93324,Spain,"Jammy aromas mix with grassy green notes in front of a sweet, chunky palate that offers unconvincing, generic berry flavors. Devoid of elegance and character but loaded with heft and baked fruit. A sweet, rudimentary wine.",NA,83,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Legado Muñoz
93325,Spain,"Balsamic and hard, with a briney, stemmy set of chemical-tinged black fruit aromas. The palate hits with force and noise; it's hard, tannic and unforgiving. The flavors of baked berry are rich, but the finish is grating and blazes with tannic burn.",Reserva,83,14,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Marqués de Olivara
93375,Spain,"Pear and apple aromas provide a good opening to this flowery, slightly sweet-tasting wine. It maintains freshness and pop that doesn't last long in the glass. Flavors of lime and melon end with a hint of papaya. Seems as if it's beginning to fade.",Claror Gran Reserva Brut Nature,87,25,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Vins El Cep
93379,Spain,"For fresh, basic Cava with a juicy profile and clarity, you can't go wrong with this. Apple and lime aromas are straightforward and clean, while the palate is tight and tastes of spiced apple, lime and orange. It's crisp, focused and easy to enjoy.",Cristalino Brut,87,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Jaume Serra
93383,Spain,"From an off vintage, this hits with piercing cherry and black olive aromas. It's powerful, almost astringent, with grating tannins that intensify as the wine unwinds. Brandied cherry, coffee and chocolate flavors set up a rowdy finish.",Lot 264 Gran Reserva,87,24,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Cameron Hughes
93386,Spain,"Rubbery dark-berry aromas yield to earth, leather and chocolate scents upon airing. This feels healthy and standard, with full-force flavors of medicinal berry.

93389,Spain,"Red plum and cherry aromas accompany a hint of lemony oak. The palate feels fresh, suggesting tomato, with ample body.

93393,Spain,"Good wine from a very hot year. Early aromas of Band-Aid and barnyard fade with airing, and then forest floor and black fruit step in.

Imported by Vino Cava.",Miros de Ribera Crianza,87,28,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Peñafiel
93414,Spain,"Apparently the allure of Rioja proved too great for the Torres family, because now they have a wine from Spain's signature region. Ibéricos is dark and fruity, with exotic perfume notes and also some soupy qualities. The flavors of strawberry and raspberry have a thick creamy accent, while vanilla and dill are prominent on the finish. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",Ibéricos,87,18,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Soto de Torres
93440,Spain,"Substantive, with complexities on the bouquet, this has a lemon-lime aroma that is dry, chiseled and friendly. It feels tangy, citrusy and crisp, with tangerine and lemon as the key flavors. This is fresh and focused from start to finish. The addition of 15% Chardonnay brings it up a notch.",Brut Nature,90,17,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Sonim
93563,Spain,"This is a great wine, from a vintage that wasn't great. The nose is smooth and rich, with raspberry, plum, fine oak and all the spice that comes with it. The palate feels fresh and healthy, with racy blackberry fruit tempered by creamy chocolate, vanilla and spice. Like most high-end wines from the Eguren family, this is right on the money.

93624,Spain,"Strawberry and raspberry aromas come on with aggression, and the bouquet doesn't really evolve.

Decent red fruit character throughout but not much feel or depth.",NA,83,7,Levante,Utiel-Requena,NA,Tempranillo,Finca Milena
93629,Spain,"Mint, carob and green-tinged fruit aromas precede an herbal-tasting palate with olive-influenced plum, berry and cola flavors. From down south in Spain, it shows pretty good body and an okay mouthfeel, but the flavor profile is a little funky and strange.",Castillo de Almansa Tintorera,83,10,Central Spain,Almansa,NA,Garnacha,Bodegas Piqueras
93666,Spain,"Dusty apple and mineral aromas are clean, but that's about it.

Cleansing on the finish.",Getaria,87,25,Northern Spain,Getariako Txakolina,NA,White Blend,Txomín Etxaníz
93672,Spain,"Peach, melon and pithy aromas work the opening, followed by a leesy palate of mild peach, nectarine and melon flavors.

93678,Spain,"Crackling aromas of grapefruit, scallion, mineral and green herb are initially pungent. It feels tangy and offers plenty of zap in front of the lime, green apple and nettle flavors. It's solid on the finish, but nothing too serious or complex.",Vega de la Reina Hacienda Zorita,87,14,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Marqués de la Concordia
93683,Spain,"Tame black-fruit aromas are leathery, darkened by asphalt and tar notes. This wine feels good and round, with plum and berry flavors that accompany resiny oak. Fruity, nice and pleasant, it doesn't announce itself as special or elevated.",Reserva,87,30,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Ysios
93684,Spain,"Straightforward cherry and raspberry aromas carry a floral accent. It feels zesty and tight, with plum, herb and tomato flavors, with a finish that shows a vanilla note. A fresh, simple wine at every turn.",Crianza,86,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,El Coto

93687,Spain,"Rooty aromas of licorice blend with earth, leather and cheese scents. It feels thick and chewy, with condensed flavors of grilled meat, berry, chocolate and herb.

93689,Spain,"Less pungent and angular on the bouquet than in the past, this has apple, pear and vanilla aromas.

Drink now.",NA,86,23,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,José Pariente
93695,Spain,"An interesting if not exactly perfect Cab Franc from central Spain. It has some of the grape's typical leafy dampness but in the mouth the wine is bright and brutally tannic, with blackberry, plum and cassis flavors. Ripe, chewy and meaty, with plenty of power and fruit but not a ton of finesse.",El Cabernetf de Chozas Carrascal,87,49,Levante,Utiel-Requena,NA,Cabernet Franc,Chozas Carrascal
93703,Spain,"Lively right off the bat but also sort of jumbled and cheesy. The palate features red-fruit flavors and candy, while the finish is aggressively racy and a bit raw.

93712,Spain,"Dusty and floral on the nose, with tropical fruit aromas and a touch of nut oil. A blend of 60% Verdejo and 40% Viura that is wet, fresh and healthy.

Best Buy.",NA,87,12,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,White Blend,Recorba
93732,Spain,"After a leafy, somewhat burnt opening that seems muddled, things fall into place.

93853,Spain,"The Eguren family makes a handful of take-no-prisoners Riojas, and this is probably the best value among them. Earthy and deep; the roasted berry, ham and sweet vanilla aromas lead to a palate that's the picture of health and balance. The fruit character is outstanding as are nuances of tobacco, chocolate and spice. Drink from 2012–2020.",Colección Privada,93,52,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
93861,Spain,"A little more raisiny than expected, but that's offset by a brilliant floral streak and more dominant blackberry, blueberry and black plum flavors. Finishes with a mix of freshness, delicious prune fruit and chocolate. Tasted blind, like we do in almost all cases, this wine was easy to identify as Calvario; it has a uniqueness to its fruit. Drink now through 2018.",Calvario,93,150,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Finca Allende
93931,Spain,"Smells fairly burnt and dull, with earthy, stemmy aromas that are strained and tough.

Rustic and stemmy, with a low pulse.",Crianza,83,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Rioja Vega
93942,Spain,"Jammy and flat smelling, with little to no depth to the nose. The palate is snappy but there's just enough body to offset the acidity, while the flavors of red fruits are tart and regular. Dull tasting, with a fairly long finish that's unexciting.",Vertus,82,10,Levante,Utiel-Requena,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Iranzo
93959,Spain,"A green, struggling wine from front to back. The nose kicks up underripe aromas to go with distant red fruit, while the palate is edgy and prickly, with high acidity creating snappy cherry and green flavors.",Esenzia,82,9,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra del Bajo Aragón,NA,Garnacha,Bodegas y Vinos de Lécera
93976,Spain,"The nose is grassy and stalky, with fresh-cut hay and straw aromas. It tastes semisweet, just as the label promises. Look for candied apple and lime flavors with a peachy twist.",Absidis Semi-Seco,86,16,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Masia Puigmoltó
93977,Spain,"At first this is lactic and heavy, but later it becomes charred and toasty. Its feel is full, round and fairly smooth, with baked plum, berry, vanilla and chocolate flavors. The finish is toasty and solid. Good for a 50,000-case production.",Crianza,86,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Raiza
93994,Spain,"Sweet black fruit, road tar and a whiff of grass makes for an interesting, attractive nose. With its medium body and medium depth, the palate shows cherry, cassis and tomato flavors, and the finish offers a rush of red fruit, tannin and brown sugar.

94014,Spain,"Dark and deep, with cola, black fruit and truffle aromas. There's good lift to the palate, but overall it has to be classified as a dense, warm-climate wine with a big body and equally large flavors of black plum, olive and coffee. Seems short and a little simple on the finish.",Uno,87,40,Levante,Valencia,NA,Monastrell,Bodegas Rafael Cambra
94015,Spain,"A bit rubbery and smoky on the nose, with some hardness. Airing reveals raspberry and vanilla aromas, while the palate carries some jolt due to sizable acids. Tastes like a burst of red plum and pie cherry, while the finish is tannic, long and full of leftover red fruit. More than respectable for La Mancha Syrah. Imported by North American Beverage Group.",Baldor Tradición,87,23,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Syrah,Bodegas y Viñedos Castiblanque
94046,Spain,"The rose petal and kirsch aromas are easy to like, with notes of tobacco and smoky earth in the mix. It feels good, easygoing and mature, with raspberry, cherry and spice flavors. Cool, collected and mature as a whole, this is ready now.",Mas Mallola,90,35,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Marco Abella

Imported by Frontier Wine Imports.",NA,87,16,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Blanco Nieva
94280,Spain,"This wine impressed us more now than when we tried it last year. It is showing commendable intensity and concentration, and while it seems slightly medicinal, it brings on the plum and baked-fruit flavors. Probably a bit more heavy and mushy than ideal, but we like the wine's ripeness and dark flavors.",Dos,87,28,Levante,Valencia,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc,Bodegas Rafael Cambra
94281,Spain,"Sweet and fragrant, with off-the-grid aromas of blueberry and exotic spice.

94359,Spain,"Ribera del Duero wines in this price range are few and far between, so while Vivir, Vivir starts with some classic RDD funk and leather, it soon rises to the occasion by showing plump black-fruit flavors, a wet and balanced mouthfeel, and classic pepper and bitter chocolate on the finish. A good wine if your expectations are not too high.",NA,86,10,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,"Vivir, Vivir"
94362,Spain,"A strong, blunt and fairly appealing wine with cola/root beer aromas along with tobacco and raisin on the nose.

94363,Spain,"Roasted on the nose, with big scoopings of rubber, leather and raisiny fruit. The palate leans toward red-fruit flavors, but the feel is jangled and acidic.

94509,Spain,"Jammy smelling but also lean and minty. The palate is almost sour, a bit better later on, but never does it rise above tight, lean and tart.

Best Buy.",NA,87,9,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Marqués de Cáceres
94578,Spain,"Dark, sweet and arguably a little raisiny on the nose. That sweetness translates into a thick mouthfeel cemented by weight and a tannic grip.

94670,Spain,"Simple but steady and composed. This is throwback-style Rioja crianza, meaning it's moderately oaked and not very fat or expressive.

94869,Spain,"Pungent and sweaty smelling, and even though it's 50% Verdejo and 50% Viura, it's the Verdejo that stands out. Fresh and flashy in the mouth, with lively lime, gooseberry and green apple flavors. And the finish is zesty and wet, with plenty of acidity and spritz. Imported by Grapes of Spain. Best Buy.",Fuente Milano Verdejo-Viura,86,10,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,White Blend,Bodegas Escudero
94870,Spain,"The funky blue bottle aside, this is a good, lightweight, clean Viura that shouldn't steer anyone wrong. Nice pear and apple aromas are basic but welcoming, and the tangerine and green apple flavors are crisp and whet the whistle. Best for simple quaffing. Imported by Admiral Imports. Best Buy.",Rinsol,86,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Bodegas Franco-Españolas
94878,Spain,"Darker, denser and more raisiny than your average varietal Graciano, this wine is almost pruney and horsey. But it settles down to offer solid but chunky black plum, prune and balsamic flavors. The finish is stocky but not flabby. Meaty and solid for Graciano. Imported by Baron Francois Ltd.",NA,86,23,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Graciano,Viña Ijalba
94884,Spain,"Get at this wine while it's still fresh and you'll likely enjoy its pineapple, apple and mango essence. It's a bit plump and oily in terms of feel, but overall it gets things right as it pours on the fresh pineapple on both the palate and   finish. Imported by Luneau USA Inc. Best Buy.",NA,86,10,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Analivia
94893,Spain,"Hard, crusty leather is the opening aroma, then a touch of tar gives way to notes of tobacco, latent oak and perfumed, mature fruit. It feels full, grabby and on the cusp of being syrupy, with roasted berry and spice flavors. It shows an herbal, hot side on the finish.",Single Vineyard Reserva,89,32,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo,Ochoa
94903,Spain,"Focused and fresh, this has aromas of berry and integrated citrus. It feels rubbery and lush, with acidic cut and roasted flavors of plum, blackberry and leather. It finishes mildly roasted and earthy, with a leathery lasting impression.",C,89,15,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Carchelo
94913,Spain,"Toasty oak and hickory aromas are the primary greeting, with licorice, pastry and blackberry notes underneath.

It's dense on the finish, with smooth tannins and heft.",NA,89,30,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Campo Alegre
94917,Spain,"This gets going with clean, light cherry and berry aromas that bring a citrus note to the fore. It feels crisp, dry and pure, with citrus, plum and dust flavors. An elegant rosé made from the Trepat grape, it finishes dry and spicy, with ample leftover fruit.",Rosado Brut,89,18,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Mont Marçal
94925,Spain,"Talk about magnetic aromas of bacon, tobacco and bold black fruit, and then comes an oak-rich palate full of coconut, butter, chocolate and exotic berry flavor.

94945,Spain,"Make room in the cellar for this heavyweight! Talk about a monster wine; but there's also finesse, character and style to it. Alabaster is the top wine from the Eguren family's new Toro winery, and it's big, tannic and loaded with spice, molasses and syrupy black fruit flavors. Rich, long and fierce on the finish, with tannins and heat to resolve. Best from 2012 through 2020.",Alabaster,94,250,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Teso La Monja
94957,Spain,"If you like old-fashioned country fruit supported by a forest's worth of oak, then this is probably up your alley. It's a rusty, aging wine with mossy, murky aromas of roast plum and carob. The palate is fading in terms of fruit, but there's a whole lot of vanilla, dill and resin in wait. Still lively but a little too oaky and thin.",NA,85,69,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Vitis Terrarum
94964,Spain,"Somontano wines are not always easy to love due to firm acidity and limited flesh and fluff. Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon account for 70% of this lean, solidly oaked wine that revolves around its tangy raspberry and cherry core. Freshness and Old World restraint characterize Marboré.",Marboré,85,30,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Pirineos
94968,Spain,"Quite sweet on the nose, with cherry-cola, berry jam and other sweet berry fruit flavors. There's not a whole lot of dryness to this red-colored, red-riding Cava.

94971,Spain,"Expect no shortage of power and pounding tannins from this modern-styled, heavily extracted Tempranillo. The nose is dark, sweet and jammy, but all pleasantries cease there; the palate is tannic as nails, with baked plum and other roasted dark-fruit flavors. To this taster, it's a hard, tough wine. Others may find it more appealing.",M2 de Matallana,85,39,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Telmo Rodríguez
95130,Spain,"Earthy dark-berry aromas come with moderate spice. It feels fresh and shows solid grip on the palate, along with notes of plum, blackberry, vanilla, dill and tobacco. Short and dry on the finish, it has a minty accent.",Reserva,86,16,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Arroyo
95133,Spain,"Tight-grained oak aromas give off qualities of tobacco and spice that are met with a touch of raspberry. Fruity, it fits the equation of classic Rioja: It delivers light strawberry, raspberry, plum and vanilla flavors on a fresh, acid-driven frame.",Crianza,86,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Camboral
95143,Spain,"Dusty, spicy and a little scratchy on the nose, this has leather, vanilla and mild fruit aromas. It feels tangy, with a light herb flavor working in tandem with dry plum and berry notes. Briary, spicy and drying on the finish.",Monte Haro Red,86,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Federico Paternina
95154,Spain,"Inky and jammy upfront, this has cheesy leather and berry aromas. It feels good, with ripe tannins and a flavor profile of juicy berry and cherry that lacks some complexity. The finish is awash in ripe, powerful berry.",Viñas Viejas,86,12,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Garnacha,Teorema
95157,Spain,"This is pretty neutral on the nose, except for the saline, citrus and pear aromas. It feels juicy, fresh and average, with slightly sweet flavors of kiwi, lime and white grapefruit. It turns more pithy as it finishes.",NA,86,15,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Nidia
95172,Spain,"Just like the previous vintage, this is a melony, fresh wine with apple aromas backed by a semi-creamy palate of peach and banana. It has a soft outlook but it isn't flabby, and thus a slight finishing note of powdered sugar and vanilla frosting seems right. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd. Best Buy.",NA,86,8,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Viura,Maximo
95176,Spain,"Slightly baked and raisiny, with aromas of black currants and blackberry jam.

Imported by Fine Estates From Spain.",Classic,86,17,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Onix
95181,Spain,"An interesting white wine based on Chardonnay and Xarello. It's like Cava without the fizz, and the nose starts out dry and like Sherry before green apple and lime come into view. Tastes really dry and chalky, with mineral and apple at its core. Imported by Organic Vintners.",Chardonnay - Xarel-lo,86,15,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,White Blend,Can Vendrell
95198,Spain,"Rusty in color, this has a baked fruit aromas suggestive of raisin, cherry and plum. It's thick, but it maintains freshness due to the solid acidity.

95201,Spain,"Rusty in color, this is loaded with dill, tobacco, lemon peel and spice aromas. It feels choppy and jagged on its own, but will do better with food.

95204,Spain,"This is always a really good buy among rosé sparklers and a personal favorite in the Best Buy category.

It's dry, spicy and fairly smooth on the finish.",Cordon Rosado,88,12,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
95215,Spain,"Notes of baked-berry, herb and savory spice come together well on the bouquet. It feels chunky and round but lively, with plum and cassis flavors that carry an herbal, tomatoey shading.

95226,Spain,"A touch doughy on the nose, with prune and blackberry aromas that are neither pushy nor aggressive. The palate is ripe, rich and just forward enough, with blackberry, wild berry, coffee and fudge flavors. Settles nicely on the finish, and overall this wine shows almost all of what's good about modern Ribera del Duero wines. 250 cases made; drink now through 2015.",Tinto Figuero Noble,93,131,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,García Figuero
95243,Spain,"Outstanding Sherry with complexity, richness and character. The nose has a salinic zest to it, making it no wallflower, and of course there's raisin and prune. The palate is formed, sculpted and balanced, with peanut M&M;'s candy, roasted fruit, chocolate ice cream and more. A beauty with power and poise.",Matusalem Oloroso Dulce Viejo,93,45,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,González Byass
95247,Spain,"This is the tier-two wine from the Egurens' new Toro project, and it's stellar. Intense aromas of black fruit, char and mint start it out, and next up come cola, roasted black fruit, clove and cured-meat flavors. Oak is forward now, but it should settle in a year or so. A dynamite Toro to drink from 2011 through 2018.",Victorino,93,71,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Teso La Monja
95249,Spain,"A wonderfully balanced and giving wine with sweet raisin and prune aromas and an overall richness akin to crude oil. Flavors of baked black plum, brown sugar and molasses are both juicy and rich, and then toffee and mocha take over on the finish. Sweet and thick for sure, but with discernible fruit and vitality.",Noe Viejo,93,45,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Pedro Ximénez,González Byass
95250,Spain,"Fairly gassy and sulfuric off the bat, so the nose isn't ideal. Patience will be partially rewarded with jammy strawberry and raspberry flavors along with mocha. However, it never does fully get rolling. It settles on solid but midlevel red-fruit flavors and a similar mouthfeel.",NA,85,18,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Gazur
95254,Spain,"An ordinary but competent Rioja. The fruit is light but young and fresh; the palate touches on raspberry and plum. A bit of mineral and natural bitterness work the finish, and overall this is a no-complaints kind of $10 wine.",Monte Clavijo,85,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Criadores de Rioja
95257,Spain,"Slightly reduced but still balanced enough to give off a positive early impression. The wine is sweet, almost syrupy, but it's that same ripeness that gives it more oomph and richness than most under-$10 wines. Finishes baked and almost stewy, but if you get at it early it should deliver all the black fruit and size one can expect from a value-priced offering.",Reinares,85,8,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Eguren
95262,Spain,"Slightly prickly and peppery on the nose, but there's enough clean red-fruit aromas and dustiness to bring it along. The palate is simple and nice enough, with tight acidity, stanching dryness and zest. A good but limited wine that delivers what it should but nothing beyond that.",NA,84,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Darien
95263,Spain,"Dry melon and papaya aromas are common and proper for Cava. The palate, however, is ultrasweet and is weighted down by the wine's dosage. In the end, it's a candied type of bubbly that finishes cloyingly sweet and creamy. Best for fans of sweet white wines.",Brut Jove,84,13,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Família Oliveda
95267,Spain,"Mildy green and drying on the nose, with bramble and leather along with distant red fruit. The palate is soft, light and fluid, with mild raspberry and plum flavors.

95270,Spain,"A little sluggish on the nose, but if you concentrate on the feel and overall balance the wine grades out fairly well. The flavors run from pickled raspberry to salty plum, and never is the wine very sweet or rich. Conversely, it settles on tight and lean, with juiciness rather than pulp.",Añada,84,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Lar de Paula
95271,Spain,"Simple floral and sweet-fruit aromas are good, while the palate runs creamy and thick, with dull-edged plum, berry and chocolate flavors. This is a round, uncut wine that fits the description of your basic country crianza. Imported by USA Wines Inc.",Crianza,84,12,Central Spain,Manchuela,NA,Bobal,Viña Altaba
95274,Spain,"Quite tannic and biting, but beyond those mouthfeel issues this affordable RDD has its positives. The bouquet of toast, mocha and coconut is alluring, and then the palate of dark-fruit flavors, while rock-hard, is masculine. But never does one escape the feel and balance shortcomings. It's a like a ride down a pocked and bumpy gravel road.",Monte Castrillo,84,13,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Finca Torremilanos
95277,Spain,"Warm and earthy at first, but more soupy as it opens. Crisp, snappy red-fruit flavors are also on the herbal side. Nervy yet it does show a reasonable amount of honest Rioja quality. Still, for a 2001 reserva it doesn't amount to much.",Reserva,84,18,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Castillo Clavijo
95278,Spain,"Young and bouncy, and that's to be expected from this type of juvenile Tempranillo. However, should you like full-fruit young wines with force and no oak, it's not at all bad. Expect juicy black cherry and other runaway flavors.",NA,84,11,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Condado de Oriza
95279,Spain,"Simultaneously snappy and creamy on the nose. The palate is a touch tangy and raw, but there's enough clean Garnacha fruit coming in raspberry/cherry flavors that it warrants more than a single pass. A little grabby and tight on the finish, but it rates as a good country wine. Imported by USA Wine Imports.",NA,84,12,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Garnacha,Algairen
95368,Spain,"Rock solid and dense, with aromas of black cherry and cassis along with a whiff of aged cheese. The palate is tight, tannic and rubbery, with grabby black cherry and blackberry flavors along with toasty, dark shadings. Finishes firm, with a touch of black olive and herbs. The best MC to date; drink now through 2017.",MC,91,46,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marqués de Cáceres
95437,Spain,"Modest and generally clean on the nose, this features little more than a touch of berry. It feels tight and juicy, with citrus flavor and not much complexity. A note of pink grapefruit shows up on the finish.",Pinot Noir Brut Reserva Rosé,86,17,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Marqués de Gelida
95454,Spain,"Light pink in color, this has chewing gum, watermelon and dust aromas. It is underwhelming on the palate, with a simple mouthfeel and flavors of cotton candy and cherry.",Rosé Brut Reserva,85,23,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Llopart
95457,Spain,"This wine's grassy plum and berry aromas have a lactic angle. It feels full but gripping, with pasty floral flavors that leave a grabby residue on the finish. Drink now.",NA,85,10,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Grenache,Magnífico
95466,Spain,"This wine explores the fresher, racier side of the Priorat region. Berry fruit with just the slightest hint of raisin dominates the nose and the palate. Flavors of red plum and raspberry are borderline scouring, but then the finish gives some mocha and sage to bring everything into focus. Best with food; drink now. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",NA,86,22,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Los 800
95469,Spain,"Tropical and easy to like. We don't see many white Garnachas in the U.S., but this one shows mango, melon and vanilla on the nose and the palate follows up with lychee, apple and baking spice flavors. Plump and mellow but with adequate acidity; refreshing while it's young. Drink now. Imported by Grapes of Spain. Best Buy.",Garnacha Blanca,86,11,Catalonia,Terra Alta,NA,Grenache Blanc,Las Colinas Del Ebro
95474,Spain,"Gritty, granular and a bit raisiny at first, and then more settled later on. For Monastrell this is snappy, dry and solid, with cherry, raspberry, plum and vanilla forming a standard flavor package. The finish offers a bit of chocolate cream, but overall it's basic, tannic and full, with some bite.",Crianza,86,18,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Casa de la Ermita
95494,Spain,"This is slightly smoky, toasty and yeasty up front, with a touch of matchstick to the nose. Rich, sweet tasting and candied on the palate, it has baking spice, apple and honeydew flavors. It's tasty throughout and just elevated enough in mouthfeel to earn a few complexity points.",Elyssia Gran Cuvée Brut,88,18,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
95505,Spain,"This leans a little green and soda-like on the nose, but it picks up clarity and speed on the palate, which carries a tangy, citric snap. It tastes of citrus and lees, and the finish is medium in length and healthy.",Brut Reserva,88,21,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Agustí Torelló Mata
95509,Spain,"Roasted plum, baked berry and jammy aromas can't be missed, but it's structured and not at all soft in the mouth, with wild berry, cherry and boysenberry flavors. It really pours on the fruit, ending fresh with no nonsense.",NA,88,15,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Red Blend,Mas Sorrer
95510,Spain,"Dry, toasty and composed up front, this has a nice palate set straight by proper acidity and base structure.

95522,Spain,"Nice, brawny and integrated, with sexy aromas of wild berry, dark plum, leather and earth. The palate has the right weight and tannic grab, while the flavors of black fruit, fine herbs, cola and coffee are measured yet generous. Finishes with driving chocolate and vanilla flavors. Drink now through 2016.",Old Vines Unfiltered,93,89,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Remírez de Ganuza
95536,Spain,"Teso la Monja is the new Toro winery from the Eguren family of Rioja fame (former owners of Numanthia-Termes in Toro), and it's proof that no beat has been missed since they sold out to Moët Hennessy. Expect dark, intense black fruit aromas and flavors mixed with heat, tannin, cola and spice. Some oak creeps out on the finish, but overall this is a lovely, bullish Toro. Drink now through 2014.",Almirez,92,22,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Teso La Monja
95553,Spain,"A bit funky and gassy on the nose, and while the wine offers ripeness and sweetness on the palate, there's always a little something strange and sulfuric lingering. It has its plum and acidity, but the tannins and overall mouthfeel are grabby.",Joven,84,14,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Martín Berdugo
95561,Spain,"Burnt oak, tire rubber and bramble vie with blackberry and vanilla aromas. The palate is brambly and a little lean, with strawberry and raspberry flavors taking on some grassy wildness. Simply stated, the fruit flavors just aren't of the highest order. Otherwise, it's good enough.",A10 Nuestra Perfección,84,40,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Anta
95564,Spain,"A bit aggressive, with handsoap and citrus aromas. The palate is lean and clean, with lemon juice, grapefruit and lime flavors. Any way you look at it, this is an apéritif wine. Expect more from what amounts to a basic Viura and you're asking too much.",Reinares,84,8,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,White Blend,Bodegas Eguren
95566,Spain,"Red in color and pretty clean on the nose, where raspberry and rose petal essence come together. The palate is acidic and tight, with tangy watermelon and peach flavors carrying the cleansing finish. Juicy to the extreme, but a good partner for food.",Rosado,84,8,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Rosé,Coto de Hayas
95572,Spain,"We didn't go crazy over the 2005 and the '06 Sentido is also challenged. It's soft, raisiny and borderline overripe. The flavors are roasted and short, with low acidity, soft tannins and plenty of toast and coffee on the black finish. More baked than vivacious, with some excess weight.",Sentido,84,24,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Neo
95577,Spain,"Our bet is that a granular, reduced, raisiny wine like this will not have broad appeal. Yet if you are interested in trying a blend of Samsó, Garnacha and Syrah it has some core qualities, namely old-school raisin and plum flavors backed by core tannins. A country-style wine if there ever was one.",Saó,84,12,Catalonia,Terra Alta,NA,Red Blend,Celler La Bollidora

95762,Spain,"Opens with hard, ripe, almost forced aromas, which settle with air. The palate is wiry, firm and a touch hot, with cola, raspberry and plum flavors that rattle around on a bed of racy acidity.

Imported by North American Beverage Group.",Etim Selección,85,15,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Red Blend,Agricola Falset-Marca
95768,Spain,"Aromatically forward, with rubbery blackberry and grilled meat aromas. When it settles it shows grapey flavors and a chewy mouthfeel. Grabby, alert and snappy on the finish; this wine doesn't lack bounce or kick.",Garnacha & Tempranillo,85,11,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Red Blend,Ochoa
95769,Spain,"Nice black cherry, cracked pepper and a slight wave of perfume make the nose attractive, while the palate is bright and a touch sharp with red-fruit flavors.

95781,Spain,"Lightly fragrant and fruity on the nose, with earth and leather to give it meaning.

95791,Spain,"The aromas of orange and mineral are uncomplicated and friendly. It feels pure and offers good flow, with apple, lime, mineral, white pepper and anise flavors.

95834,Spain,"Rich and pruney, with bold, reduced black fruit aromas along with chocolate and spice. Compact and delicious in the mouth, with caramel, black coffee and other yummy, unctuous flavors.

95852,Spain,"The first couple of passes are not that encouraging: there's strawberry Kool-Aid and sharp field-like aromas of thistle and bramble. But the palate is not bad at all; it is flush yet racy, with solid raspberry and plum flavors that carry onto the finish. Not a refined wine but a natural one.",Faristol,84,14,Catalonia,Terra Alta,NA,Garnacha,Covilalba
95854,Spain,"A bit cheesy and funky, with rhubarb and leather along with baked berry aromas. The palate feels fine, but the flavors are leathery and sort of salty, with touches of pepper and herbs as well. Not as ripe and appealing as what we're looking for from a Rioja reserva.",Reserva,84,24,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Baron De Ley
95866,Spain,"Solid but unspectacular on the nose, with plum scents and generic sweetness. The palate is also sweet, but it has enough acidity and tannin to create a serious, almost scratchy mouthfeel. And if you hadn't had enough sweetness up to this point, the finish is loaded with brown sugar, cola and cough medicine.",Vega Ibor,84,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Real
95867,Spain,"By no means a special wine but it does deliver full-force if generic dark-fruit aromas and flavors. The nose is a little hard and rubbery, but that's Utiel-Requena for you. Medium-bodied but not harsh or burnt; prune and blackberry flavors linger. Tempranillo and Syrah.

95872,Spain,"Bramble and burning brush on the nose, while the palate is murky as it delivers tomato leaf, baked plum and carob flavors. Seems sort of cooked and funky, with a muddled mouthfeel. The 2005 is a cleaner, more focused wine.",NA,83,10,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Coto de Hayas
95874,Spain,"Dill, cheese and mossy fruit give this wine a less than super bouquet. The palate is light, with strawberry flavors mixed with some peppery, herbal overtones. Short on the finish; not much bang for the buck.",Reserva,83,19,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Diez-Caballero
95878,Spain,"Cloudy in appearance but fairly clear on the nose and palate. Rhubarb and cherry aromas give this an austere, red-fruit bouquet, and the palate rests on racy cherry and doesn't budge.

95879,Spain,"Lean, dry raspberry aromas and a slight floral essence carry the nose toward a zesty, semisharp palate with crisp cherry and cranberry flavors. Not bad in a lean, stripped-back way; but there's no excess oak, weight or sweetness. Lean stuff for old-school palates nursing plates of ham or salami.",Arderius,83,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Leza García
96031,Spain,"Dry herb and spice aromas precede a solid, drawn-down palate, with lively acidity and flavors of medium-dark berry, toast and herb. Modest in intensity, this is composed.",NA,85,11,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Zinio
96040,Spain,"Fiery berry and cherry aromas emerge with a hint of milk chocolate. This wine feels high in acidity, with raspberry, tart red plum and spice flavors that finish with citrusy snap and grittiness.",Bordón Reserva,85,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Franco-Españolas
96045,Spain,"Narrow but perfectly acceptable on the nose, with white fruit aromas, this may not have much feel and style, but the flavors of soda cracker, lime and apple are dry, ending on a baking spice note.",Brut Kosher,85,13,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Gran Sarao
96048,Spain,"With Ribera wines there's an assumption of tannic presence, but this older vintage, while displaying a classy bouquet, is brutally tannic, with an acid-washed palate. Splashes of cranberry and plum flavors are cut by lemony acidity and drying sandpaper tannins.",Gran Resalte,85,120,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Resalte
96058,Spain,"Gold in color, this has chunky aromas of oily white fruit and sea water. Thick in feel, it nevertheless has enough acidity to protect the wine's body and integrity. It tastes of orange and nectarine, before falling flat and mealy on the finish.",NA,85,23,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,O Rei de Campoverde
96065,Spain,"Gritty and tough, but amid the rough tannins and bite there is red plum, licorice candy and brown sugar sweetness. Flavors of berry fruit and raisin cover the racy and sweet ends of the spectrum, while the finish is tight to the point of being raw.",Chateldon Gran Reserva,85,30,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pinord
96072,Spain,"An unusual blend of Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Picapoll that hits with apple and melon aromas. The palate is soda-like, with zest, spritz and tangy lemon-lime and green apple flavors. Dry, pithy and a little strange in its flavor profile. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Abadal Blanc,85,19,Catalonia,Pla de Bages,NA,White Blend,Masies d'Avinyo
96075,Spain,"Pungent and sweaty like Verdejo, and definitely not Albariño as we know it. This Castillian white starts out strong and sweaty, like hockey gear left too long in the bag. But the flavors of pink grapefruit, kiwi and lime are good, and the feel is fleshy if a bit flat. Finishes pithy and citric. Imported by Frontier Wine Imports.",Albarin,85,18,Central Spain,Tierra de Castilla,NA,White Blend,Pardevalles
96079,Spain,Not for everyone but not a bad sweet wine for desserts and cheeses. The nose is hard to describe but the palate and flavors are familiar: sweet applesauce and sugared pastry along with mango and candy. Decent acidity keeps it fresh and moving forward. Imported by Admiral Imports.,Diamante Semi-Sweet Malvasia-Viura,85,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Bodegas Franco-Españolas
96085,Spain,"Earthy, leafy compost aromas are initially evident on the nose, and while the wine has some feel issue due to an abundance of raw tannins, it eventually rounds out and delivers oily, herbal flavors of blackberry and plum. Dark and muscular, but also aggressive and beefy. Seems a little untamed for a Telmo Rodriguez wine. Imported by Vintus LLC.",Dehesa Gago,85,19,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Telmo Rodríguez
96099,Spain,"Meaty, dense, savory and extremely oaky and dark on the nose. Feels tannic and tough, with intensity to spare and tons of black-fruit flavor that turns more toasted, roasted and barbecued as the wine unfolds. Finishes with burnt meat and mint flavors along with grinding tannins. Needs another 3 or 4 years, and even then it may not be a soft, friendly Mencía.",Art,88,55,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Luna Beberide
96130,Spain,"Deep purple in color, with roasted, rubbery aromas of wild blackberry. Thick, lush and rich in the mouth, with mellow tannins (for a Priorat wine) and big, broad flavors of plum, blackberry and herbs. Smooth on the finish, with black tea notes and leftover oak. Has a lot going for it; drink now through 2012.",Cartoixa,91,52,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Scala Dei
96134,Spain,"A genuinely attractive, well-made old vines red with earthy, minerally aromas along with violet petal and blackberry. The palate has a fine feel to it, depth and complexity, while flavors of dry berry and baking spices work wonders. Dry, pure and long on the finish, and really quite excellent for a vino de tierra. Drink now through 2014.",Dominus Gran Selección Viñedos Viejos,91,50,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Yllera
96150,Spain,"The only sweetness on offer is on the nose. After that, things go lightweight and tangy, leaving a racy feel and semiastringent cherry flavors. A real sizzler with zesty red fruit and not much else.",Montesierra Oak Aged,83,9,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Pirineos
96156,Spain,"Simple, candied cava is what this is. The nose deals red licorice and cherry, while the palate is bubbly and plump, with plum and raspberry flavors. Not much detail but plenty of size and carbonation.",Rosat-Sec,83,15,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Família Oliveda
96157,Spain,"Meaty and very oaky, with resin, mocha and milky aromas that amount to a wood cutter's dream. Not surprisingly, the mouthfeel is more shocking and acidic than the oaky bouquet suggests; flavors are racy and tart, and then a bitter lactic quality comes on strong. Too much going on, with nothing pulling in the same direction.",Crianza,83,15,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,Gladium
96164,Spain,"Blocky and brambly on the nose, with a fair amount of funk. The palate is crisp, semitart and lean-bodied, and with tight acidity it's a little scouring. Lots of red-fruit character but not a lot of mouthfeel.",Single Estate Garnacha - Merlot,83,11,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Red Blend,Reula
96166,Spain,"Pickle and sweet funk on the nose give this chunky wine a nose that's less than fresh. Flavors of orange, peach and cantaloupe are sweet but flat, and in the end it tastes more like a fruit juice than a really solid dry rosé.",Rosado,83,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Darien
96174,Spain,"Quite an unusual specimen in that you don't often see Monastrell mixed with Cabernet and Shiraz. The end result is fairly strange and unfamiliar; the nose smells saucy and lean, while the palate is also saucy and a touch medicinal.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz-Monastrell,83,11,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Mad Dogs & Englishmen
96175,Spain,"Rusty in color but natural, which is also this wine's downfall. It has no dosage, so what's left is leafy, herbal Pinot Noir aromas and flavors. It's peachy, drying and zesty, but also saddled with tomato leaf and rhubarb. Such is the life of Brut Nature rosé.",Brut Nature,83,40,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Pinot Noir,Maria Casanovas
96179,Spain,"The name boasts of balance but we find mostly pine needle, skunk and eventually creamy red-fruit aromas followed by lean, tangy stawberry and cherry flavors. Light fruit and simple oak is all that's here.",A4 Nuestro Equilibrio,83,23,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Anta
96256,Spain,"A little scratchy on the nose, but otherwise it exudes pure aromas of cassis and raspberry. The palate is juicy, racy and snappy but full and structured, while the flavors of raspberry, plum and blackberry get sweetness in the form of coconut and vanilla-infused coffee. Less soft and bodied than previous vintages but a big winner nonetheless.",Colección Privada,91,54,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
96331,Spain,"The nose is floral and earthy, with light berry aromas. It feels a bit clacky, with lemon-driven acidity in front of oaky, savory, earthy berry flavors. This is taut and a little warm on the finish, with savory, salty flavors and a clipped feel.",Vendimia Seleccionada,85,30,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Resalte
96334,Spain,"This smells mildly grassy and green at first, while balsamic vinegar and tobacco notes enter the frame later on. It's solid and average in mouthfeel, with a slightly sweet and syrupy berry flavor that's tempered by tomato-driven acidity.",Crianza,85,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Casa de la Reina
96339,Spain,"This smells foxy and jumpy, with a candied cherry aroma. Fresh and forward, scratchy and rough, this has raspberry, plum and resiny oak flavors. It breaks down and turns somewhat metallic on the finish.",Third Generation Dama de Toro,85,13,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Fariña
96340,Spain,"Green melon and lettuce aromas are fresh and clean. The wine feels solid and good, and there's a jumble of baked apple and melon flavors. Yeasty on the finish, it's made entirely from Macabeo grapes.",Brut,85,9,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Idilicum
96342,Spain,"Initally it smells rubbery and nutty, with a baked, earthy personality. With airing, it opens somewhat but remains leathery and cheesy. This feels fairly full, with baked, toasty flavors of herb, berry and plum. It is moderately long on the finish.",Reserva,85,24,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Valdubón
96343,Spain,"Jammy berry, blueberry and spice aromas meet the nose, followed by a narrow palate that turns softer as the wine airs out. Flavors of jammy berry and raisin end on a mellow, chewy finish. A soft Garnacha for casual consumption.",Viñas Viejas,85,10,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Garnacha,Viña Alarba
96345,Spain,"Moderately leafy and brambly smelling, this is supported by its berry aroma. It feels edgy and juicy, with tangy, herbal raspberry and plum flavors. The finish is quick and snappy, with a hint of tomato and lasting green flavor.",Sangre de Toro,85,12,Catalonia,Catalunya,NA,Red Blend,Torres
96357,Spain,"Floral berry aromas are fresh and carry only the slightest grassy, green element. The wine feels crisp and tight, with nice red plum and raspberry flavors. Mild, focused and not very hefty or thick on the finish.",NA,85,9,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Garnacha,Castillo de Monséran
96368,Spain,"Clean as polished glass, with touches of red plum and cherry on the nose. The palate is fresh and balanced, but basic and moderate in terms of flavors. Finishes with light cherry and raspberry notes. Garnacha with 30% white Viura. Imported by Admiral Imports. Best Buy.",Rioja Bordón,85,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Rosé,Bodegas Franco-Españolas
96372,Spain,"If basic Argentinean Torrontés is to your liking, so will this be. It's fresh and green on the nose, with melon and lychee aromas. Those fruits carry onto the palate, where lemon-lime and crystallized mango flavors are sweet but crisped up by snappy acidity. Serve chilled. Imported by Frontier Wine Imports.",Viura & Chardonnay,85,11,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,White Blend,Ochoa
96381,Spain,"Big and baked, with aromas of cheese and leather offsetting sweet black fruit. Flavors of cola, blackberry and chocolate are as baked and sweet as the nose, and the feel is grabby and leaves a sugary residue on the finish. Wants to be a modern, ripe wine but proves to be simple and overdone. Imported by The Portfolio Group.",Crianza,84,22,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Baigorri
96383,Spain,"Aromas of barrel spice and grilled pineapple are solid, while the palate is thick and creamy with orange marmalade and banana flavors. If you like a thick, unctuous Chard with a glob of oak, this is it. Has its strong points but tastes too much like cinnamon stick and wood. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",Vinya Gigi,84,24,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Chardonnay,Jean León
96386,Spain,"Spice and leather aromas are positive while the smells of burnt leaves and green herbs aren't too appealing. The palate is big and wide with a mix of cherry cough drop, plum and burnt coffee flavors. And the finish evaporates fast, leaving heat and medicinal notes.",Proyecto Cu4ro,84,12,Catalonia,Catalunya,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Concavins
96387,Spain,"Minty smelling, with herbal red fruit and rhubarb scents. The wine is clack, clack, clack on the palate as acids and snappy red fruit draw everything down to the base level. Flavors of raspberry and light vanilla are clean but high-toned, and there's an undercurrent of tomato. A tough wine from a vintage to forget.",Reserva,84,25,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Casa de la Ermita
96389,Spain,"A touch green and grassy at the start, with cinnamon, cherry candy and red-fruit aromas. The palate is fresh and snappy, with sweet berry flavors and just a slight bit of resin and/or green character. Finishes light and quick, making it an easygoing red wine that isn't meant for deep analysis.",NA,84,9,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Garnacha,Lelia
96391,Spain,"This is a unique wine from Mallorca with light cherry and raspberry aromas. Clampy, dry and tannic on the palate, it's full of savory, roasted barbecue flavors along with tomato and red fruit notes. Very Mallorcan in that it's salty and savory from start to finish.",ÀN/2,88,23,Spanish Islands,Vi de la Terra Mallorca,NA,Red Blend,Ànima Negra
96422,Spain,"Rich, dense and syrupy, but also showing touches of mint and leather on the nose. Quite sticky in the mouth, but with lovely toffee and mocha flavors that set up a finish that runs on and on. Impressive depth of flavor, nice overall balance and a mix of complexity and flat-out richness make this PX a winner.",Nectar Dulce,91,18,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Pedro Ximénez,González Byass
96431,Spain,"Round, stylish and wholesome on the nose, with wild berry, smoke, spice and not too much obvious oak. The palate is racy and forward, but also offers subtleties including dry fruit, spice, fresh tomato and wild herbs such as thyme and sage. Long and warm on the finish, with vanilla. Drink now through 2015.",Fincas de Ganuza Reserva,91,48,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Remírez de Ganuza
96438,Spain,"Dense and heavy, and maybe a touch dull on the nose in terms of fruit aromas. But once it hits the palate the wine shines with intense black fruit, sugar beet and chocolate flavors. The finish is toasty and warm, with saturation and texture. Almost over the edge as far as ripeness, but not quite. Drink now through 2012.",Vendimia Seleccionada,91,59,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,García Figuero
96439,Spain,"Another impressive Oloroso from Gonzalez Byass. This is a sweet, dark, brooding Sherry with prune and other sweet fruit aromas. The palate is rich but has good flow, while dark flavors of dulce de leche and burnt brown sugar are wonderful. Sweet but balanced by mild coffee-like bitterness on the finish.",Solera 1847 Oloroso Dulce,91,18,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,González Byass
96446,Spain,"Serious, stately Rioja with key aromas of prune, blackberry and leather. Snappy enough on the palate, with plenty of pop as well as pure berry flavors, smooth tannins, zest and dry vanilla. Some might call it a bit acidic and traditional, but with food it'll do great. Drink now through 2016. Only 250 cases made.",El Belisario,91,80,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Agrícola Labastida
96452,Spain,"Almost volatile, but with reduced raisin below. If you are familiar with   hot-climate California Zinfandel, this is not unlike that. It has a vinegary attack and then a strange but limited sweetness lurking in the weeds. A   challenged wine.",Javier Asensio Tinto,83,10,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Red Blend,Asensio
96457,Spain,"Very dark and seemingly on the cooked side of the ledger. The nose is black and raisiny, while the core flavors are saucy. At least this meaty, overdone Garnacha isn't oaked, so in that sense it isn't offensive. But it is definitely soft, and without much future.",Viñas Viejas,83,11,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Garnacha,Bodegas Agustín Cubero
96459,Spain,"Airén is a big-crop white grape that is usually distilled into brandy or made into Sherry. But here we see it as a dry white table wine, and while it is limited in scope, the wine's punch-bowl approach and cleansing lime and kiwi flavors are decent.",NA,83,8,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Airen,Sierra Virgen
96462,Spain,"Apple and powdery citrus aromas are austere but intriguing. But in the mouth, this thing foams like bubble bath. No matter whether you like the wine's citric flavors and apple essence or not, the fact that it bubbles up like a shaken soda is not an attribute. Oriel's gran reserva is similar in terms of carbonation issues.",Brut,82,18,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Oriol Rossell
96468,Spain,"Brambly and tart, with a peppery, leathery nose. It's zesty, lightly concentrated Garnacha with zingy, mouth-burning raspberry and plum flavors. A sharp, reticent wine in every way. Imported by USA Wine Imports.",Ladera,82,21,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Garnacha,Algairen
96469,Spain,"A lesson in contrasts: the nose is both weedy and sweet, with green strawberry aromas mixing with caramel. The palate is also green and slightly bitter, but that's offset by some jammy berry sweetness. Medium in terms of weight, but with burdensome sugars and a clumsy finish.",Vertus Crianza,82,15,Levante,Utiel-Requena,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Iranzo
96472,Spain,"An herbal and brambly roughneck with forced aromas, lots of leather, and ultimately cranberry and other tart red-fruit flavors. Not much body, and thus it's short and piquant.",Roble,82,21,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Hemar
96562,Spain,"An elegant and well-made Albariño with lemon chiffon, pear and green apple aromas. The palate is just right in feel, depth and minerality, with apple, pear, honeydew and hidden spice flavors. Clean, teetering on lush and delicious as it finishes. Drink this pretty wine as soon as possible.",NA,90,15,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Leira
96631,Spain,"This smells like plastic and milk chocolate at first, then with airing it begins to take on its classically Rioja character. It feels fresh and zesty, with a medium body and red fruit flavors that are spicy, lightly herbal and generic. A mid-level wine in every way.",Reserva,85,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Casa de la Reina
96632,Spain,"Medicinal cherry and plum scents come with a grassy, minty persistence. This feels tannic and syrupy, with some heft, accompanying sweet black-fruit flavors that are green and herbal at the core. It finishes chunky, with a minty aftertaste.",Dehesa Gago,85,18,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Telmo Rodríguez
96651,Spain,"This is flat and lemony on the nose, with a hint of asparagus. It feels zesty and tastes of tart lemon-lime and green bean. Tangy but not edgy or razor-like on the finish. This is a classic cool-climate white with citrus and green elements running the show.",NA,84,26,Northern Spain,Getariako Txakolina,NA,White Blend,Zudugarai
96655,Spain,"Dry on the nose, this has light red-fruit aromas that are offset by spice and vanilla notes. It feels snappy and raw, with tart citrus, plum and tomato flavors. Crisp, quiet and vapid on the finish.",Bordón Crianza,84,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Franco-Españolas
96656,Spain,"This smells rubbery and a bit gamy, with meaty berry aromas. Tannic, with gaps in the mouthfeel, it has flavors of prune and herb, which are not excessively sweet or raisiny. The finish is dry, tannic and steady.",Roble,84,14,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Prado Rey
96659,Spain,"A standard raspberry aroma introduces this wine, which feels short on substance but reasonable, with jammy, medicinal flavors of raspberry and strawberry. It is sweet, mild and candied on the finish.",Joven,84,9,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Viña Palaciega
96662,Spain,"A tiny bit earthy and peppery, with solid berry fruit aromas. The palate is sappy and medium-weight, with red-fruit flavors dominated by raspberry. Shows a touch of mocha/chocolate on a dry, basic finish. Imported by Bourgeois Family Selections.",Rubens,84,11,Central Spain,Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Tikalo
96663,Spain,"Definitely sweet, syrupy and raisiny. Torres has made a chunky, plodding wine with saturated berry and plum flavors but hardly any of the mineral, schist, zest and excitement the Priorat is renowned for. Deep, dark and dense for sure, but ultimately flabby and mediocre. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",Salmos,84,37,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Torres
96668,Spain,"Stretched on the nose, with reedy, wiry, candied red-fruit aromas. Quite tannic and a bit syrupy in the mouth, with ultrasweet berry flavors and then a scratchy, forward finish. Has its merits but seems out of place and pushy for Spain. Imported by Classic Wines, Inc.",Hacienda,84,14,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon,Casa del Valle
96676,Spain,"A decent old-school throwback, with dried spice, pepper and slight red-fruit aromas followed by a light-bodied palate of plum and raspberry. While it's mostly lean, there is the smallest note of caramel and toffee to the finish. Drink now.",Tierra Serena,84,10,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,Artiga Fustel
96683,Spain,"A fleshy, simple wine with gumball aromas. The palate is chubby but not all that structured, with plump but basic berry and plum flavors. The finish shows some blackberry but not much else. Good and generally clean, but rudimentary. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",Crianza,84,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,CVNE
96684,Spain,"Starts out pretty good and fruity, but becomes more challenged with time. There's a truckload of early raspberry fruit, but it turns more sharp and piercing the more time it sits. Lengthy and potent, but not elevated.",NA,84,12,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon,Finca Antigua
96685,Spain,"Sweet and syrupy, with molasses on the nose. On one hand it's rich, ripe and flavorful, but also cooked, lumpy and heavy. It's almost like a sweet red; sappy and made to be drunk soon.",Veleta,84,16,Andalucia,Vino de la Tierra Contraviesa Alpujarra,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon,Dominio Buenavista
96692,Spain,"This is as crisp and dry as a whispy reed, with a mild grassy note on the nose. It feels fresh and focused, with lime, peach and apple flavors. Fruity, fresh and easy to like from start to finish, this is what a Best Buy should be.",Brut Reserva,88,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
96704,Spain,"This is a little wayward and funky on the nose, with a lightly pickled aroma. It's a forward Cava with a yeasty, creamy feel. Its acidity and proper bubbles set up flavors of pastry, powdered sugar and sweet apple. The finish is quick, ending with a white-pepper flavor.",Aliguer Brut Vintage,87,16,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Agustí Torelló Mata
96710,Spain,"Aromas of root beer, autumn leaves, leather and raisins indicate ripeness more than heavyness. It shows lots of life and kick on the palate, where the flavors run toasty and rooty, with a hint of brown sugar. Peppy acidity keeps it lively and traditional through the finish.",Viña Rubican Crianza,87,14,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Corellanas
96711,Spain,"Hard and capped on the nose, this has hints of cement, cheesy oak, minty fruit and tobacco. Savory and roasted on the palate, with a blend of Marsala and mushroom as well as saline, baked berry and ham notes. The finish is savory in a natural, nongreen way.",Luzón Crianza,87,15,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Luzón
96712,Spain,"Lemon, lime, apple and nectarine aromas are regular and clean. It feels good, citrusy and just round enough, with passion fruit, grapefruit and orange flavors. Tasty and fresh, this works well as a refresher.",NA,87,13,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Bodegas Solo Privee
96721,Spain,"A smooth and coaxing Sherry with almond and dried fruit aromas that lead perfectly to toffee and almond flavors. There's more dryness than fruit here, with peanut brittle accents and then a long, smoky finish that doesn't lose focus. Graceful Oloroso, with a nice individual character.",Cristina Oloroso Abacado,91,18,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,González Byass
96737,Spain,"This is nothing more than a few barrels of wine bottled by Hughes, a so-called “global vintner.” And like its Lot 128 brother, it is really good juice. Inky and floral, with blueberry and wild raspberry flavors. It's smooth, fresh, bold and finishes with mint and chocolate. Shows the positives of Campo de Borja's Garnacha.",Lot 129,90,15,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Cameron Hughes
96746,Spain,"Dry and smooth, with balsam and cedar aromas wrapped around controlled fruit scents and toast. The wine is ripe and balanced, with hickory flavors adding a barbecued angle to the steady palate. Firm, structured and tasting of clove and woodspice on the finish. Drink now through 2011.",Crianza,90,19,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Solabal
96751,Spain,"Ribera is not prime rosé country, and this wine doesn't much help the cause. Cherry cough drop aromas are about all you're going to get, while the palate is jumpy and sour, with apple skin and grapefruit flavors. Too much like a sucking candy.",Monte Castrillo Rosado,82,13,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Rosé,Finca Torremilanos
96759,Spain,"Rooty on the nose, with green herb, tea and raspberry aromas. Patience and airing only brings it to the acceptable level, which means the wine's reasonably good prune and dark-fruit flavors are scuttled by a disjointed, overly acidic mouthfeel.",Fill del Temps Gran Selecció,81,25,Catalonia,Terra Alta,NA,Red Blend,Covilalba
96766,Spain,"There's something not right about the way this winery is fermenting its Cavas because both this and Oriol Rossell's regular brut are excessively foamy. As a result, this gran reserva's apple and spice aromas and flavors are rendered moot by the gaseous explosion that occurs when liquid hits palate.",Gran Reserva Brut Nature,80,27,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Oriol Rossell
96767,Spain,"This is mucky and sweet. Its best foot is not put forward via the compost-like nose, and from then on there's little more than prune, leather and a sticky mouthfeel.",NA,80,8,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Garnacha,Castillo de Monséran
96768,Spain,"Eight grapes comprise this weird, peanutty, almost dirty red blend. The nose is like a salad of bitter greens and peanut vinaigrette, and the palate shows big fruit, bigger tannins and then a finish of asparagus and green beans. Imported by USA Wines Inc.",Las Ocho,80,25,Levante,Utiel-Requena,NA,Red Blend,Chozas Carrascal
96935,Spain,"Reasonably clean, simple and steady on the bouquet, this is subsequently chunky and fairly full in the mouth, with grassy red-fruit flavors that end with tannic clamp. Perfectly drinkable for a large-production wine (38,000 cases).",Viñas Viejas,84,12,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra del Bajo Aragón,NA,Garnacha,Evohé
96937,Spain,"This is wide and sweet on the bouquet, with pear and cider aromas. It feels thick and a bit grabby, with basic apple flavor and not much more. Long on the finish, it has a decent feel if you don't mind some excess foam.",Brut,84,15,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Dominio de la Vega
96943,Spain,"Earthy, rubbery aromas accompany rustic notes of stalk and leather. This feels astringent and grabby, with green berry and mint flavors. It finishes with size and power but not much agility.",Viñas Viejas,84,20,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Garnacha,Las Rocas de San Alejandro
96944,Spain,"Citrus and yeast aromas form the nose on this wine, which feels forward and bubbly, with some sizzle to the palate. Cherry, plum and nectarine flavors are good, and it finishes with vitality. This is sweet and flavorful stuff.",Cristalino Rosé Brut,84,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Jaume Serra
96951,Spain,"Asphalt, leather and paint aromas are present on the scratchy bouquet. It feels clacky, with pushy acidity and flavors of tomato, saline, herb plum and raspberry. It's lively, with a bite to the finish.",Pavo Real Crianza,84,21,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Xavier Flouret
96954,Spain,"The nose is leathery and mulchy, with earthy berry aromas. It feels raw and choppy, with stalky, leathery, burnt flavors, plus pinches of green and mint. Ultimately it doesn't have much berry power or clarity.",NA,84,20,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Peña Roble
96959,Spain,"This smells rubbery and gritty, with notes of gas and leather. It feels acidic and drawing but healthy, with earthy red-berry flavors. Dry and peppy, there's still not a lot of style or character to the wine.",Banda Roja Reserva Red,84,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Federico Paternina
96967,Spain,"This smells rubbery, like a tire, before the berry and plum aromas settle in—although it remains a bit like pastic in scent. It feels tight and balanced, with acidity pushing flavors of plum, strawberry and mineral. This is crisp, juicy and more acidic than weighty on the finish.",NA,87,40,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Mas La Mola
96986,Spain,"This is dense and saturated, with crushed blackberry and plum aromas that turn more jammy and granular as the wine breathes. It's extracted and heavy on the palate, with candied black plum and berry flavors that lose steam on the finish. This could be too heavy for fans of leaner-bodied wines.",Vespres,87,28,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Red Blend,Celler Dosterras
96990,Spain,"A slightly murky and chemical-smelling wine with a nose of rubber band, beets, red fruits and licorice. It's sweet and roasted in the mouth, with molasses and raisin flavors. Hard tannins and a gritty finish make it a tough run. The winery is trying to make something good and elevated, but the vintage (hot) didn't comply.",Abadal 3.9,84,40,Catalonia,Pla de Bages,NA,Cabernet Blend,Masies d'Avinyo
96994,Spain,"Nobody ever said Yecla in southern Spain is Sauvignon Blanc country, but here is proof that the grape does exist there.

Imported by Marquee Artisan Wines.",Old Hands,84,11,Levante,Yecla,NA,Sauvignon Blanc,La Purísima
97002,Spain,"The nose is heavy and dosed with burnt rubber and leather, but the palate fares better, with cherry and raspberry flavors and a pretty clean and clear mouthfeel.

Imported by Freixenet USA.",NA,84,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Garnacha,Tapeña
97008,Spain,"Early match-stick aromas fade and give way to scents of white fruits and wisteria flower.

Deutsch & Sons.",Viura + Viognier + Sauvignon Blanc,84,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,White Blend,Volteo
97009,Spain,"Rather oily and hard on the nose, with dried cheese, brett, mint and black fruit. The palate is rich and extremely forward, and the flavors are sweet but not that substantive or complex. Chocolate and mocha on the finish are about as much carry-through as you get.",Gran Viu Selección,84,36,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Red Blend,Viñedos y Bodegas Pablo
97018,Spain,"Rather baked and heavy, with chunky black fruit and chocolate on the nose. First in line on the palate is raisin and prune, while in back of that there's vanilla, dill and brown sugar. With grating tannins and excess weight, this one has balance issues while still offering some good looks at Ribera del Duero. Imported by Admiral Imports.",Reserva,84,29,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Finca El Encinal
97023,Spain,"A fuller, more minty and deep Garnacha than Hughes' Lot 129. This has standup, standout aromas followed by deep berry fruit flavors. It has plenty of body but keeps its balance, and the finish is thick and strong. A little rugged but really good by regional standards.",Lot 128,90,15,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Cameron Hughes
97025,Spain,"A touch horsey at first, but with time it settles on saddle leather and earthy fruit. The palate is chunky and beefy, with some funk, chocolate and herbal black fruit.

Drink now through 2012.",Manuel Quintano Reserva,90,50,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Castillo Labastida
97133,Spain,"A barrel-aged surprise. The nose is round and toasty but not overwooded. The palate is balanced and elegant, with full, round, integrated flavors of dry apple, cream and spice.

97263,Spain,"Peppery and lightly herbal on the nose, with a whiff of dry red fruits. The palate is pretty snappy and angular, however, the red-fruit flavors mixed with pepper and spice ring true.

97267,Spain,"Smells a little fiery, although you do get decent cherry and raspberry from the nose.

Pretty good, with commercially viable sweetness.",NA,84,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Tapeña
97268,Spain,"A hint of burnt leaves and compost draws down the bouquet, but overall this is a decent $9 wine.

97276,Spain,"Given the price, this wine is more than acceptable and may even be pleasing for those not seeking greatness. It is punchy and grapey, with a bit of dried cheese on the nose along with berry and plum. It's sizable, loud, concentrated and tastes pretty good.

97277,Spain,"Aromas of berry fruits, coconut and leather add up well, but the wine falls off in the mouth, where it's sweet, gummy and jacked up.

97284,Spain,"Char-accented wild berry and plum aromas go straight into a bright, edgy palate of cherry and plum, and overall this is a simple, slightly candied Garnacha that has some sizzle and burn to it.

97289,Spain,"A heavy aromatic dose of funk, bramble and rubber is what greets you, and that reduced awkwardness never leaves the wine. Size and in-your-face leather and animal notes are dominant traits, and only below that do you find blackberry, plum and any mellowness. A good mouthfeel is the wine's saving grace. Imported by Frontier Wine Imports.",Azul,83,18,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Estancia Piedra
97293,Spain,"This has an earthy nose, but airing helps this Monastrell-Syrah blend move beyond the leathery, warm notes.

97542,Spain,"A dusty cherry aroma turns harsh with airing, setting up a tight, acidic palate that's marked by tart raspberry and plum flavors.

97564,Spain,"While it's golden in color, the wine isn't oaky or over the hill. Scents of buttercup, honeysuckle, baked apple and melon lead to a round, almost Burgundian-like mouthfeel. The flavors of melon, apple and peach are solid, and the finish is naturally creamy from the 50% Gewürztraminer in the blend—Macabeo comprises the other 50%.",Selección Mesache Blanco,87,10,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Macabeo-Gewürztraminer,Bodegas Pirineos
97581,Spain,"Tobacco, brown sugar, dried fruit and vanilla aromas work the bouquet, which is very nice. In the mouth, however, it's acidic, almost to the point of being citrusy.

Drink now.",Gran Reserva,87,110,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Matarromera
97583,Spain,"The nectarine and mild vanilla aromas are subdued yet solid. On the palate, it's all about stone fruit flavors, such as peach and nectarine, with apple and cider notes on the balanced and healthy finish.",Brut Reserva,87,15,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Mont Marçal
97585,Spain,"Freixenet's signature Cava is consistent and pure as usual, with aromas of white fruit and white pepper and an overall freshness on the nose.

97599,Spain,"Best early and then it shows its lesser pedigree later on. Early aromas of ripe berry fruit aren't bad before they shift to measurably jumpy and edgy. There's black cherry candy flavors and then snap, crackle and pop on the tongue. Good for the price.",Opera Prima,83,6,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,J. Garcia Carrion
97600,Spain,"Seems sort of waxy and baked, with mildly acrid aromas of burnt corn leading the way. The palate has an o.k. feel but the flavors are rather bitter and burnt, and the fruit isn't pointed or expressive. May already be past its prime.

97606,Spain,"Not bad on the nose, where strawberry and cream aromas are doused a bit by a burnt-field smell.

97609,Spain,"Pleasant but very basic, with a nose of dry cherry and a palate that's crisp, lean and features flavors of tart plum and cherry.

Imported by Classic Wines, Inc.",Añares Crianza,83,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Olarra
97610,Spain,"Starts out on shaky ground with coconut and chemical aromas. In the mouth, it hits very hard with cola, raisin and cherry flavors.

97612,Spain,"Roll out the barrel, or the staves, or the oak dust, or whatever it is that gives this modest Chardonnay such an overpowering wood element.

97613,Spain,"Stemmy and rough out of the blocks, with aromas of rubber and strawberry.

97619,Spain,"With tobacco, licorice, herbs, bell pepper and carob, there's a bit of everything to this Navarran Cabernet. The palate is thick and chewy, but it's also sticky and very tannic.

97622,Spain,"When in doubt, you can always trust Dry Sack. As always, this is a powerful, rich Sherry with burnt sugar and heavily toasted coffee and caramel flavors. It's no softie courtesy of heat and acidity, and at all points it mixes its sweet side with tough, roasted intensity. Great for cigar smokers.",Drysack Solera Especial Sweet Old Olorosso Aged 15 Years,90,25,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Williams & Humbert
97643,Spain,"Excellent Ribera crianza here. It has a smooth, appealing bouquet of candied berry fruit, which is followed by a rich palate of cassis, black cherry, prune, chocolate and coffee.

97704,Spain,"Dry, spicy and earthy on the nose, with Boston baked bean aromas and candied berry fruit notes.

97833,Spain,"This wine smells fermented, like Tequila. Linear, acidic and lemony on the palate, it has tart apple and pineapple flavors. A citrus note carries the finish to a modest end point.

97892,Spain,"A mixture of tomato, jammy red fruit, alcohol and grit gives this four-grape, Garnacha-led blend a tough path to hoe.

97894,Spain,"Standard berry along with warm, earthy aromas give it some size, and the palate shows medium-bodied raspberry and strawberry flavors.

97900,Spain,"Neutral smelling, with a hint of pool water to the nose. The palate delivers a strange combination of mustard and white grapefruit, and the finish is pithy to the extreme and mildly bitter.

98206,Spain,"Thin and saline on the nose, with a chemical-chlorine smell. The palate is fairly sour and raw, with tough tannins and a killer grip.

100557,Spain,"At first the nose is high toned and jumpy, but with time it falls into a good place with a medicinal berry note at the fore. Solid, tannic and nervy, it has plum and noticeable young-oak flavors. This turns herbal tasting and choppy on the finish.",Joven,85,11,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Martín Berdugo
100633,Spain,"Coconut and vanilla aromas ride front and center on the oaky nose, although berry fruit rises up with time. The palate is bulky and saturated, almost what you'd call thick, while the flavors lean toward roasted berry, plum and woodspice. Vanilla and additional wood accents work the finish.",Reserva,87,23,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Condado de Oriza
100642,Spain,"Round and generally attractive, with raisiny richness that emerges with airing. The palate is more snappy and acidic than the nose might suggest, with herbal raspberry flavors. That same acidity lifts the finish, and overall the wine is fresh, racy and not that complex.",Reserva,87,25,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Prado Rey
100649,Spain,"From Viña Mayor, this French-oak-aged wine is composed and dry, with good plum and berry aromas that bring balanced oak as well. The palate sports proper weight and balance, solid berry and plum flavors, and a warm, minty finish. Not mind blowing but good for a weak vintage.",Secreto,87,20,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Mayor
100680,Spain,"Jammy and sweet smelling, with intensity and a lot of ripeness. Throughout it teeters on the precipice of being overripe, but amid the chunky darkness and sweetness there's tasty berry, chocolate and spice. Finishes a bit pruney and raisiny, so get at it as soon as you can.",Gaudium,90,64,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Marqués de Cáceres
100685,Spain,"An interesting, well-made wine with distinct barrel notes. There's woodspice, toast, vanilla and elegant white fruit on the nose, yet the palate maintains Verdejo's natural verve while offering flavors of cinnamon apple, spiced pear, banana and tropical fruit. Drier on the finish, with a nip of butterscotch.",Selección Personal,90,36,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Emina
100700,Spain,"Full, earthy and ripe, but also delivering alot of clean fruit, size and balance. The palate has moderate to full tannic grip, which props up berry, vanilla, wood and mild herbal flavors. Long, solid and a little oaky late, with proper purity and a commitment to the near future. Drink now through 2011.",Crianza,90,35,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Val Sotillo
100707,Spain,"An attractive, ripe wine that pushes up against raisiny but then draws back to focus on blackberry, licorice and other dark aromas and flavors. Very good weight and mouthfeel, with nice balance supporting ripe berry, cola and mild chocolate flavors. Finishes lush and warm. Drink now through 2011.",Crianza,90,30,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Finca Torremilanos
100839,Spain,"This opens with lightly perfumed red-fruit aromas of raspberry and plum, with a bright palate that shows mostly red plum, raspberry and cherry flavors.

100840,Spain,"Call this Toro Nuevo in the same vein as Beaujolais Nouveau—the grape juice becomes finished wine in just six weeks. Look for a jammy nose with licorice and blackberry aromas and a simple palate that pushes plum and berry flavors, with little structure or stuffing.",Vino Pr1mero,85,12,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Bodegas Fariña
100843,Spain,"Aromas of hay and sweet grass are offset by notes of apple and melon. It feels healthy and easy, with white peach, nectarine and apple flavors. It's good and uncomplicated, with a touch of corn flavor on the finish.",NA,85,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Viura,Maximo
100920,Spain,"Slightly more leafy, herbal and burnt on the nose than ideal, but there's also tobacco, cherry and earth notes to keep it proper. The palate is smooth in feel, with good depth, while the flavor profile has a salty side as well as black cherry and molasses. Good wine with a few issues.",Crianza,87,24,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Pago del Vostal
100921,Spain,"Raisiny, sweet and baked, with plenty of oak coming on as it airs out. This vintage is somewhat syrupy and strained compared to prior years, with baked black fruit flavors. Seems a little reduced on the finish, but overall it's still good given this winery's strong track record and how the wine compares to other 2007 Riojas.",Propiedad,87,40,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Palacios Remondo
100930,Spain,"Solid, big and fruity, which is basically what a Campo de Borja Garnacha should be. Sweet red fruits and robust kick define the palate, which is tannic but not obtrusively so. Zesty and a bit of a one-noter, but a nice one. Garnacha with 30% Syrah and 10% Mourvèdre.",Lot 98,87,10,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Red Blend,Cameron Hughes
100934,Spain,"Dry, dusty and minty on the nose, with cherry, cedar and sweet oak notes. The palate has a hard, clangy bite to it, while the flavors run toward herbal cherry and dried tobacco. Some vanilla and cola along the way bring up the pleasure quotient. Drink now.",Miros de Ribera Reserva,87,50,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Peñafiel
100946,Spain,"Opens with peach and apple aromas that are 100% normal, while the palate has a chiseled clarity to it that's crisp and appreciated. A flavor profile of dry apple, citrus and dusty spice is good, and the finish is fresh and lemony. Drink right away.",NA,87,17,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,La Caña
100985,Spain,"For a Valencia D.O. wine, this is darn appealing. The nose is warm, rooty and smells of cola nut, fresh raisins and cassis, while the driving palate offers roasted black fruit flavors along with sweet tomato and herbs. Drying and tannic on the finish, but balanced. Neither cooked nor overweight. Drink now through 2011.",N° 12 Selección Especial,90,35,Levante,Valencia,NA,Red Blend,Venta del Puerto
100996,Spain,"Pine needle, cedar plank and forest floor define the mature nose, while the full, grabby, tannic palate is loaded with likable cola, black fruit and chocolate flavors. Ripe, pure, rich and tannic, with some bite, burn and ruggedness. Drinkable now but needs food to cut the tannins.",Prestigio,90,25,Northern Spain,Cigales,NA,Tempranillo,Val de Los Frailes
101004,Spain,"There's no denying the wine's power and intensity. It's concentrated like a cement block, with richness, plummy aromas, sweetness and char. But it's also candied and ultrarich in the mouth, with syrupy flavors of berry extract, cola and chocolate. A heavy wine that shows every ounce of its 15.5% alcohol. Ultimately it's more sweet and powerful than it is precise. Drink now through 2013.",NA,90,142,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Cabernet Blend,El Nido
101005,Spain,"This wine gets it right. The color is dark and opaque, while the nose offers perfume, Middle Eastern spice, fruitcake and solid black fruit. Enticing in the mouth, where full black fruit flavors are pumped up by fine herb and spice notes. And then coffee and chocolate fill the finish. Drink now through 2010.",Jaros,90,35,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Finca El Quiñón
101026,Spain,"Aromas of cucumber, mineral and melony white fruits are inviting, while the palate is forward and issues bright, solid flavors of green banana, kiwi and papaya. Well made and friendly for a simple, affordable white Spanish blend.",Sangre de Toro Viña Sol,87,11,Catalonia,Catalunya,NA,White Blend,Torres
101034,Spain,"Opens clean and friendly, with bacon, cassis and plum aromas. The palate is round, fairly large and pure, with tasty black fruit flavors that are sweet, ripe and throw off a bit of licorice. Finishes long, with brown sugar and a hint of toast. Good value Rioja year in and year out.",NA,87,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
101135,Spain,"On the nose, raspberry and plum aromas come with a slight brambly note. The palate is juicy and fresh, with flavors of plum, cherry and a touch of spice.

101149,Spain,"The nose is big and rubbery, with aromas of bacon, tar and black plum. It feels young and choppy, with a lightly herbal berry flavor that turns more roasted in character as the wine opens. This gets the job done despite showing a roasted flavor throughout.",NA,85,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Señorio de Uñuela
101154,Spain,"Orange and nectarine aromas carry the nose to a wide, fairly acidic palate that still manages to fall a little flat in terms of character. Mid-tier notes of orange and stone fruit set up a finish with similar flavors.",Brut Rosé,85,18,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Red Blend,Vilarnau
101155,Spain,"This is solid stuff for the price, with berry and pencil eraser aromas. It feels more soft than hard, with a jammy mouthfeel and grabby tannins in front of berry and plum flavors that turn medicinal.",Crianza,85,5,Levante,Utiel-Requena,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Decana
101222,Spain,"Fairly generous for a bargain-priced, everyday Rioja. There's bacon, rubber, leather and mild oak on the fruity bouquet, while the palate is concentrated, jumpy and hosts honest red berry fruit flavors along with dry oak and a spot of vanilla. Meets any reasonable expectation of what $12 Rioja should be.",NA,87,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
101237,Spain,"Nice for a standard, no-frills type of Rioja. The cherry and raspberry aromas are sweet and clean, while the palate is juicy, fresh and tastes of ripe cherry, berry, vanilla and cream. Offers good clarity, power and depth given its price point.",Crianza,87,8,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Rivarey
101239,Spain,"Slightly dry and leafy on the nose, but with beef jerky, cola and mild raisin aromas. The palate is forward, with controlled heat and tannin along with cola, berry and mushroom flavors.

101320,Spain,"This pink rosado is 80% based on Garnacha, and it's attractive, light on its feet and aromatic. In the mouth, it's wide and creamy but healthy, with a chunky feel and enough acidity to propel flavors of strawberry and spice. Smooth and on the full side, but well made and ready to drink.",Rosado,87,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Rosé,Ilurce
101325,Spain,"Clean and smooth to open, with a hint of salinity, powdered sugar and peach. The palate is sheer and zesty, with lemon, green apple and tangy acidity. Crisp yet angular on the finish, but good in a narrow, lean, drilling sort of way.",NA,87,18,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,La Val
101334,Spain,"A snappy, high-acid wine that pulses with red fruit aromas and flavors. It's sheering, which is normal for the Graciano variety, but it also tastes nice while delivering a bolt of raspberry and red plum flavor. Oak comes up late, providing a counterweight of vanilla and dry spice. Nice but like all varietal Gracianos, it's sharp and limited.",NA,87,45,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Graciano,Valserrano
101335,Spain,"Clean, simple and very much in the style that has made Las Brisas a go-to value white.

101439,Spain,"The medicinal plum aroma comes with a note of celery as well as anise and/or licorice. It feels tight, with rough tannins, then tastes like fresh red berries and plum. This is a bit edgy and choppy feeling, but solid for the price.",Viñas Viejas,85,12,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra Ribera del Gállego-Cinco Villas,NA,Tempranillo,Evohé
101440,Spain,"Baked and heavy, this has prune, raisin and jammy berry aromas. The weightiness carries onto the palate, which is chewy and smooth.

101454,Spain,"This smells yeasty and flat, with a heavy, bready quality. The palate feels heady and plump, with a mealy citrus flavor and a lot of foam on the palate. It finishes a little green, grassy and herbal, with a lettuce-like note.",Gran Cuvee Brut,85,24,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Gramona
101522,Spain,"Opens with unique, abnormal aromas of spiced fruit, cardamom and nutmeg. The palate is thick along the edges but lacks body in the middle, while flavors of red berry fruit are chunky, mildly stewy and roasted. Earthy and funky wine, but with good feel and overall good character.",Nuestro,87,27,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Diaz Bayo
101534,Spain,"Not even El Bosque could escape the difficulties of the cool, extended 2007 vintage. While typically dark and bulky on the nose, it's also dull by Bosque standards, with oaky mocha and coffee stepping in as filler. The body is drawn and tannic, with oak, resin and dark berry flavors. Finishes resiny as well. By no means bad, but given Bosque's precedent it's not stellar.",Finca El Bosque,87,163,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
101586,Spain,"Opens with floral, blueberry aromas, mineral notes and a spot of jammy candy. The palate is alert and well balanced, with grab and juicy flavors of raspberry and plum offset by a wave of buttery oak. Textured, full and satisfying on the finish. Very nice wine.",Crianza,89,27,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto Fino,Legaris
101598,Spain,"A solid, serious Rioja reserva with licorice, leather, char and good berry aromas. The palate is juicy, pure and tastes of clean black cherry and cola flavors. Picks up steam as it opens up, and then finishes with a light butter streak and proper weight. No complaints; almost makes the upper echelon. Drink now through 2012.",Cosme Palacio y Hermanos Reserva,89,30,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Palacio
101608,Spain,"Classic Verdejo that won't wow but will definitely get your palate going. Standard but clean grapefruit and gooseberry aromas lead to citric but balanced flavors of orange, grapefruit and pineapple. On the dot in terms of balance. Drink as soon as possible.",NA,89,11,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Montespina
101611,Spain,"Maybe it's the Viura, becuase this $9 wine seems cleaner, rounder and slightly better than the winery's higher-priced pure Verdejos. Look for generic but fresh peach and citrus aromas and then lip-smacking citrus flavors. Finishes composed and clean, with lasting grapefruit flavor. 60% Verdejo and 40% Viura.",Isabelino,87,9,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo-Viura,Reina de Castilla
101618,Spain,"Earthy and baked on the nose, with rubber, black fruits and warm, almost burnt leather notes. The palate has a lively, dense mouthfeel and flavors of earthy berry fruits and raisin.

101621,Spain,"Minerally, dry and clean white wine made from 60% Xarello and 40% Chardonnay. The nose is peachy, while the palate is spritzy and bouncy, with short, slightly creamy apple, melon and papaya flavors that are true to Xarello. Finishes smooth but a little flat.",Petit Albet,87,13,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,White Blend,Albet I Noya
101638,Spain,"Dark and heavily oaked, so if you're into big wines with char, bacon and a lot of spice, this is it...and it's only $14. The palate is tannic and drawing, but lively and loaded with charred, lemony, black fruit flavors. A junior-level, wannabe bigtime Rioja that hints at the region's potential for greatness.",NA,87,14,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Altino
101737,Spain,"Dry, crisp and nice, this has white fruit aromas that are familiar and friendly. It comes across medium bodied, dusty and yeasty, with an apple accent and a vanilla flavor. The finish is lightly toasted and slightly briny.",Carta Nevada Brut,85,9,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
101744,Spain,"This is fruity but simple on the nose, with plum and cherry aromas. It feels jammy and a touch muddled, with boysenberry, plum and blackberry flavors but not much oak character. It's grippy on the finish.",Conde de Valdemar Crianza,85,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Valdemar
101750,Spain,"Earthy, roasted scents sit atop mild cherry and raspberry aromas that carry a slight green element. It feels shrill but juicy, with red plum and raspberry flavors.

101751,Spain,"The tea and raspberry aromas are easygoing, and that best describes this organic Cabernet Sauvignon. It's powerful enough on the palate, with a good berry flavor that tilts towards raspberry. The finish is herbal and peppery.",Organic,85,8,Spain Other,Spain,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon,Vicente Gandia
101761,Spain,"This is sweet Amontillado in fine form. The nose is centered around a core of molasses and brown sugar, while the palate bubbles with maple and toffee. Yes, it's a sweeter-styled Amontillado, but the sugar fades on the palate, leaving only the complex residue of caramel, espresso and burnt cinnamon. A lovely wine for any fan of serious Sherry.",Amontillado,93,20,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L.
101767,Spain,"Ultra concentrated and sticky, with unctuous but wholesome raisin aromas taken to a level that's almost heavenly. In the mouth, the maple, cinnamon and brown sugar flavors are lusty and satisfying, and the finish never ends. This is P.X. in awesome form.",Don PX,93,29,Andalucia,Montilla-Moriles,NA,Pedro Ximénez,"Bodegas Toro Albala, SL"
101786,Spain,"Molasses, spice, chocolate and pure raisins define this as classic P.X. It's syrupy but not too much so, with maple, cinnamon and brown sugar flavors. For a sweet and candied dessert wine, it has excellent balance and persistence. A star among many in this category; these wines are hard not to like.",Añada,92,18,Andalucia,Montilla-Moriles,NA,Pedro Ximénez,Alvear
101808,Spain,"For an old wine from a weak vintage, this has its positives. For starters, the nose offers a nice mix of dried fruit, tobacco, cedar and fig paste, while the palate is properly acidic and tastes of red plum, raspberry and oak-driven vanilla. At its drinking peak now; with preserved juiciness and lots of kick.",Vendimia Seleccionada 24 Meses en Barrica,87,27,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo,Yllera
101813,Spain,"Nothing over the top but well made and clean, with red fruit aromas that don't overpower. Flavors of peppy plum and berry flavors come across bright and zesty.

101880,Spain,"Definitely a once-ripe, raisiny wine with hard Toro tannins and molasses aromas and flavors. Borderline syrupy but with enough structure and grip to make the grade.

101882,Spain,"Bold and chunky Ribera wine with black fruit aromas that don't tread lightly. The palate is lush and features a nice overall feel, while the flavors of berry fruit and chocolate hint at raisin but don't fully cross the threshhold. Heavier and darker than prior years. Drink now.",NA,88,25,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Comenge
101886,Spain,"There's an exotic twist to the nose, which rests on black cherry, plum and a splash of black coffee.

101887,Spain,"Full, ripe and so tannic in its present form that it's scratchy and hard on the mouth. Aromas of ripe berry and syrup hint at its core power, while flavors of blackberry, fresh raisin and chocolate are true and good.

101894,Spain,"Peachy, mildly sweet, smooth and inviting. Godeval always makes a true and easy wine that showcases the essence of Godello but doesn't go off the blueprint.

Eminently drinkable white wine from Spain.",Cosecha,88,19,Northern Spain,Valdeorras,NA,Godello,Viña Godeval
101915,Spain,"Earthy, meaty and leathery, with an herbal quality to the bouquet. The palate is chunky and soupy, with stewed berry, latent sweetness, and a mild herbal aftertaste.

101916,Spain,"A big, dark, heavily oaked wine with caramel, resin and baked berry aromas.

101922,Spain,"Yeasty, sweet and easy on the nose, with apple, vanilla and pear aromas. The palate has a nice feel and flavors of citrus, spiced meats and baked apple.

102033,Spain,"This has thin fruit aromas, with scents of herb and candied milk chocolate. It's a solid wine for $8, with zesty acidity and standard raspberry and plum flavors.

102063,Spain,"Smooth and nutty, with deep secondary aromatics of apricot and orange peel. For a dry, aged Sherry, you can't object to the wine's intense citrus core and outlying toffee and hazelnut flavors. And then on the finish come those classic mushroom and bitter chocolate notes.

102085,Spain,"Big, brawny and not entirely welcoming: this Priorat heavyweight is full of licorice and cool black-fruit and cola aromas. The palate is hard as nails, and only time will tell if it softens and finds a sweeter spot. We think it will; in five years it should trade in the current burnt steak notes and fierce tannins for softer touches and more complex flavors.",Mas de Masos,91,70,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Capafons-Ossó
102086,Spain,"Serious wines from a tiny inland appellation in Catalonia—that's Abadal, a maker of true terroir wines that succeed way more often than they disappoint.

Even from a tough vintage it justifies its selected status.",Abadal Selecció,91,49,Catalonia,Pla de Bages,NA,Red Blend,Masies d'Avinyo
102098,Spain,"Dark as night, with prune and rubber on the nose along with murk and compost. It's extracted to the max, leaving a rubbery feel to go with supercharged boysenberry flavors.

102112,Spain,"An assault of oak, vanilla and cigar box is the opening salvo, while wave two and three bring raisiny aromas and finally lemon peel.

102188,Spain,"A blend of Tempranillo with Cab Sauvignon and Merlot. Aromas of black cherry, spice, aged cheese and earth are solid, while the palate features good fruit but some weakness in structure.

102236,Spain,"Full and blowsy for Verdejo, with orange, grapefruit and minerally aromas. The palate is zesty, with orange, tangerine and passion fruit flavors. With pretty good fruit character, adequate acidity and a slick-feeling finish, this is a good effort that should be drunk right away.",El Bufón,86,12,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Reina de Castilla
102332,Spain,"Nice on the nose, this has a leafy note and a mellow red-berry aroma. Bouncy and rubbery feeling, it has easygoing flavors of raspberry and plum. It's candied and rubbery tasting on the finish, but good overall.",Estate Bottled,84,4,Levante,Yecla,NA,Tempranillo,Terrenal
102350,Spain,"This is snappy all the way, if a touch raw and citric on the palate. Freshness is a virtue on this affordable Rioja, while red plum, raspberry and milk chocolate notes carry the flavor profile. Drink now.",Antaño,84,6,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,J. Garcia Carrion
102356,Spain,"Briary berry and milk chocolate aromas lead to a tart, alert palate full of red berry, sour plum, vanilla and spice flavors. Juicy acidity creates a long, racy finish that brings lasting raspberry character.",Crianza,84,11,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Viña Palaciega
102357,Spain,"The waxy apple aroma seems cidery and a touch oxidized given how young the wine is. It feels flat and basic, with apricot and peach flavors, and a waxy bitterness to the palate. The finish tastes stalky, like hay or straw. Only 250 cases made.",NA,84,22,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Godello,Luna Beberide
102365,Spain,"If at first the wine seems sweet and scattered, just give it time. Soon the nose will knit together to show mocha and that lightly oxidized elegance that is Oloroso. After that there's a palate of coffee, caramel and brown sugar, and a tight, grabby palate that's like your tongue is attached to a magnet. Give this one plenty of air for best results.",Oloroso,91,18,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L.
102382,Spain,"Fino Sherry rarely has this kind of weight and complexity. It's full of spunk, grab and length, and that's probably due to the fact that it's made from Pedro Ximenez grapes and not the more common Palomino. Likely marvelous with garlic shrimp or langostinos.",Fino En Rama,90,11,Andalucia,Montilla-Moriles,NA,Pedro Ximénez,Alvear
102384,Spain,"On the cusp of unbridled excellence, but since it's Cims' second wine it has its limitations. It's a bit woody and needs to broaden out with time in bottle, but even now the licorice, mineral and ripe plum/prune flavors are delightful. And the oak-driven finish of mocha and coffee seals the package.",Solanes,90,29,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Cims de Porrera
102386,Spain,"Pure and unblocked by anything other than raisin, maple and brown sugar aromas and flavors. It's thick as motor oil, with a mile-long finish and lasting notes of pecan pie and cinnamon coffee cake. Maybe it's a little candied and easygoing, but who's complaining?",La Noría,90,23,Andalucia,Montilla-Moriles,NA,Pedro Ximénez,"Bodegas Toro Albala, SL"
102452,Spain,"A heavier style of Rioja, with raisin and prune aromas and a brandied character. The palate is expectedly flush and ripe, with weight and size along with black cherry and herbal tea flavors. Shows good stamina and fullness on the finish. Ready to drink now before it starts to fade.",Barón D'Anglade Reserva,88,40,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Franco-Españolas
102454,Spain,"Heavier and oakier than No. 12, and in our opinion not quite as balanced. The nose is rich, minty and raisiny, while the rock-solid palate has fierce tannic grip and flavors of black cherry, tomato and cola. Firm and composed on the finish, but a pounding heavyweight. Drink now thru 2012.",N° 18 Vendimia Seleccionada,88,45,Levante,Valencia,NA,Red Blend,Venta del Puerto
102462,Spain,"Crisp on the bouquet, with green apple and controlled fresh celery aromas. The palate is also fresh, with basic roundness, bounce and natural flavors of apple cider, citrus and lime. Finishes with a slice of white grapefruit and a tiny spot of pith. Drink immediately.",NA,88,18,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Ermita Veracruz
102466,Spain,"Aromas of sawdust announce oak, but otherwise the nose is earthy and fairly attractive, with plum and rooty notes. Round, ripe, tannic and solid in the mouth, with broad flavors of black cherry, rubber and oak. Shows good grip on a slightly oaky, medicinal finish. Hold another nine months to let the oak settle.",Bestué de Otto Bestué Finca Santa Sabina,88,20,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon-Tempranillo,Bodega Otto Bestué
102468,Spain,"Immediately this strikes you as true Verdejo from Rueda. It has pungency on the nose, with accents of cucumber and celery to the primary passion fruit, apricot and citrus aromas. Plenty of zing to it, and tastes of citrus and fresh green apples. Then tangerine and grapefruit carry the finish. Varietally correct.",NA,88,14,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Condesa Eylo
102469,Spain,"Quite rustic smelling, with hickory smoke, barbecue sauce, spice and cola aromas. Like most Cigales wines, it has a firm tannic bite and a grating mouthfeel. But the flavors of roast berry, black plum and savory marinade is good and par for the course. Drink now.",Pago de las Costanas,88,60,Northern Spain,Cigales,NA,Tempranillo,Val de Los Frailes
102470,Spain,"Incognito deftly describes the unusual beet and blueberry aromas on this wine, which is a bit narrow and scracthy. On the plus side, it's concentrated and powerful, with bold berry flavors, tannic grip and herbal influences. Chunky on the finish but lacks the precision and identifiable Ribera del Duero character that a $75 wine should have.",NA,88,75,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Terra Incognita
102560,Spain,"Jammy, creamy and superripe, with raspberry, burnt toast and coffee on the thick, meaty nose. Flavors reminiscent of an ice cream sundae work the palate, which means berry syrup, chocolate sauce and vanilla are highly prominent. Texturally speaking, this is a smooth, soft and plush wine. It pushes the envelope on ripeness, but that's become the Cirsion way. An awesome wine that deserves a proper decanting.",Cirsion,96,303,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Roda
102571,Spain,"Colorful and pretty to look at, but a little sweet. The nose has a sweet, maple syrup element along with dry berry fruit aromas. It's healthy and fresh in the mouth, with citrus, cranberry and raspberry flavors. Simple and nice for easy drinking.",Anna de Codorniu Brut Rosé,86,15,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Codorníu
102574,Spain,"A warm, aggressive wine with baked berry aromas, kirsch, bacon and rubber. The palate has hard, astringent tannins but the flavors are good once they air out; there's blackberry, plum and brown sugar. Firms up on the finish as the tannins do their thing. Tasted twice with divergent findings; this note reflects the common traits from both wines.",Crianza,86,14,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Condado de Oriza
102583,Spain,"This is the first Las Brisas rosado that's come to us, and it's good in a tangy, tropical sort of way. The nose delivers mango along with light citrus and berry, while the palate is tangy, jumpy, citric and tastes mostly of orange and tangerine. Good but fairly monotone in aromas and flavors; made from 80% Tempranillo and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Las Brisas Rosado,86,12,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Rosé,Naia
102633,Spain,"The first whiff yields mostly raisins, but subsequent sniffs force up lush caramel and malt notes along with a blast of molasses. Cream Sherries by nature are sweet, and this one fits the bill with the full allotment of fig, date and carob flavors. Mocha and espresso on the finish cement this wine's pedigree. Great if you have a sweet tooth and fine even if you don't.",Cream,90,18,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L.
102641,Spain,"Really good and interesting Syrah, with chocolate, campfire, menthol and prune on the nose. With airing the wine quickly settles into a deep, smooth berry and chocolate groove, while the finish deals pure tannins and comfort. Ripe but not raisiny; a really nice example of Jumilla Syrah, with 4% Viognier blended in for lightness (and it still weighs in at 14.9%).",NA,90,23,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Syrah,Valtosca
102661,Spain,"Imagine all of the scents you associate with a Margherita pizza and that's what this wine smells like.

A blend of 75% Cabernet Franc and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Carlota,84,30,Northern Spain,Empordà,NA,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Oliver Conti
102681,Spain,"This is a dark specimen, with black-fruit and raisiny aromas that turn herbal with time. It has rubbery tannins and flavors of plum and herb. Good as a whole but sort of squeeky and hard in feel. A blend of 60% Garnacha and 40% Tempranillo.",Crianza,84,10,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Red Blend,Coto de Hayas
102683,Spain,"Jumpy and nervy smelling, with tottering aromas of jammy berry and strawberry. It feels dilute at first, but more structure and body appear as the wine unfolds. The flavor of jammy raspberry is somewhat herbal, and the finish is light.",Roble,84,23,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Convento Oreja
102696,Spain,"Simple, fruity Rioja with mildly candied red berry aromas that turn sweeter and more syrupy with airing.

Ditto on the finish, which has a peppery quality.",Ibéricos Crianza,86,16,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Soto de Torres
102709,Spain,"With dusty apple cider aromas and tingling acidity, this seems a lot like Galician Albariño even though it's from Costers del Segre in Catalonia. Given its price, it boasts solid if pithy apple and gooseberry flavors, modest elegance and only a touch of bitterness on a green fruit finish. Drink soon.",Viña 24,86,10,Catalonia,Costers del Segre,NA,Albariño,Raimat
102710,Spain,"Nice, simple and fruity, with nothing but standard raspberry fruit and good mouthfeel up its sleeve. The palate is narrow and juicy, while the flavor profile rests on one level: raspberry. Clean and quick on the finish. Perfectly respectable for a $10 Ribera wine.",Tinto,86,10,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Recorba
102711,Spain,"Starts with hard aromas akin to nail polish and rubber gloves. More typical and fruity in the mouth, but it remains kind of lean despite being expansive in the mouth. Tastes like raspberry, with some candy. Gets better as it airs out.",Old Vines,86,17,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Grenache,Quo
102753,Spain,"Maturing fairly well, with brown edges to the wine's earthy hue. The nose is rooty and deep, but there's a definite cheesy, mildly bretty accent to it. And the mouthfeel is defined by major tannic grip and bite. Warm and mildly raisiny, with caramel on the finish. Drink now.",Pago de la Calera,87,55,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Cyan
102758,Spain,"Slightly prickly on the nose, but there's balancing melony sweetness to keep it on line. The palate is fresh and snappy, with citrus flavors, particularly grapefruit.

102769,Spain,"Firm, earthy and rubbery aromas lead to a tight, focused palate with robust black cherry in the lead and black tea and coffee notes along the side.

102870,Spain,"Dusty apple and a clean lightness define this basic, totally enjoyable white blend that is based on the pedestrian Airén grape but features 30% Macabeo.

102883,Spain,"Big, sweet and deep in black fruits, with aromas of turned earth and sweet spices.

Finishes thick and dark, with toasty spice notes and kick.",Crianza,86,12,Central Spain,Ribera del Júcar,NA,Tempranillo,Spanish Vines
102888,Spain,"Give this wine credit for consistency: in the three years it's been on the market it has scored the same each vintage. This offering is soft, fleshy and slightly green on the nose, with a wet, easy palate that gives mild citrus, apple and peach flavors. Good in the mouth, with just enough acidity to keep it kicking.",NA,86,8,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Viura,Maximo
102943,Spain,"It's easy to throw high scores at almost any well-made P.X. because the wines are so viscous and overwhelmingly sweet. And while this one fits that bill, it has a couple of holes in it, namely a nose that stumbles out of the gate and a mouthfeel that's almost too thick and rich. Very nice but not at that ultrahigh level.",NA,89,15,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Pedro Ximénez,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L.
102958,Spain,"Merlot, Cabernet and a splash of Syrah are brought together in solid, inspiring fashion by this Catalonian winery.

102967,Spain,"This smells granular and jammy, yet it feels snappy and dry, with raspberry, red plum, tomato and briny flavors. The finish is fresh and red in style.",Antaño,83,8,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,J. Garcia Carrion
102969,Spain,"This is leathery and stemmy on the nose, with horsey plum and raspberry aromas. It feels narrow, with rubbery, herbal and roasted berry flavors. This is a rustic, roasted wine no matter how you slice it.",Luzón,83,9,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell-Syrah,Bodegas Luzón
102971,Spain,"Quiet on the bouquet, this offers aromas and flavors of a wine that's in the early stages of decline. It feels mildly oxidized and tastes of hollow fruit and yeasty vanilla. The finish is mild, with a note of hay.",Blanco,83,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Viura,Señorio de Uñuela
102978,Spain,"The nose smells minty and capped with rubbery, blackened aromas. It feels tangy and tannic, with medicinal flavors of berry and resiny oak. It's powerful but rough.",Roble,83,12,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Vilano
102979,Spain,"This smells like a new coat of road tar mixed with black olive tapenade and herb. It feels tannic and clumsy, with herb and stewed-fruit flavors. The cooked finish ends with roasted berry and olive notes.",Finca Valdelroble,83,50,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Red Blend,Pago de Callejo
102982,Spain,"This is brambly, stalky and baked on the nose, and the palate is wide, tannic and scratchy. The flavor profile is all roasted plum, bacon and herb accents, finishing stalky and savory.",NA,83,29,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Red Blend,Bula
102995,Spain,"Shows some meat and heft on the nose along with leather, rubber and black fruit. Solid and generic across the palate, with black cherry and berry flavors that are good and steady. Finishes slightly short and bitter, but overall it's a good wine for basic drinking.",NA,86,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Solar de Randez
102999,Spain,"Opens with earthy, slightly raisiny aromas along with mint, fresh grass and clay. The palate feels clanky and tannic, while the flavors of strawberry and herbal raspberry are good but bland. Shows its share of good components, but overall the wine struggles to distinguish itself among Rioja's top performers.",Reserva,86,26,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Baron De Ley
103001,Spain,"Dry and mildly herbal on the nose, with an aromatic base of raspberry and cherry. At 60% Garnacha and 40% Carignan, this is a standard Priorat blend with good intensity and a slightly reduced mouthfeel. Flavors of baked berry fruit are regular, while chocolaty warmth, fig paste and molasses work the finish. Drink now.",Gran Nasard,86,39,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Llicorella Vins
103018,Spain,"Full, savory and beefy on the nose, with a snappy, juicy palate that's flavorful and offers pretty good feel.

103019,Spain,"A touch minty and dry smelling, with simple, solid, slightly underdeveloped flavors. All in all, it's hard to find much brightness in this wine; instead it's subdued and chocolaty, and it never really crosses the Rubicon of ripeness. That said, it goes down easy and doesn't burn like many Toro wines.",Gran Colegiata Barrica,86,12,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Bodegas Fariña
103057,Spain,"Dark, roasted lead aromas frame secondary baked black fruit and leather scents, while the palate is oaky, stocky and tannic, with creamy, barrel-led berry flavors and more than adequate balance and freshness. Mocha and toast are key finishing notes, and overall it's a nice blend of 85% Garnacha with Syrah.",Garnacha-Syrah,87,12,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Grenache-Syrah,Penelope Sanchez
103067,Spain,"One of Spain's top value-oriented rosés. It's inviting, colorful, easy to understand and tasty. Aromas of fresh fruits and melon get it going, while the palate is clean, fresh, only mildly candied and full of cherry and red plum flavors. Scores high by keeping it simple.

103115,Spain,"Potent and raring to go, with lots of young oak and intense fruit that causes the wine to change in the glass in the blink of an eye. What we can tell at this early point of development is that it is saturated, healthy, balanced and clean. There's vibrancy and full tannins, with lip-smacking acidity. Already a good one to ponder, but should be even better from 2009–2011. Just 750 cases made.",Vendimia Seleccionada,93,48,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Amador Garcia
103118,Spain,"The Lui & William bodega is behind this outstanding Tempranillo from Toro. The wine shows a brilliant violet tint in front of intense, inky aromas of black cherry and chocolate cake. The palate is superripe and bucks like a bronco; the tannins are dense and form titanic structure, and the finish of coffee and spice hints at a fine cigar. It's a huge load at 15%, so be prepared.",Lui Selection,93,27,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Abelis Carthago
103170,Spain,"Sweet and lightly floral on the nose, but also kind of generic and wan. The palate is wet, with hollow white fruit and apple flavors.

103194,Spain,"Leather, roasted berry and barnyard make for a rustic, warm nose. The palate is grippy, with chewy, roasted black fruit flavors.

103231,Spain,"Give this stylish wine a few minutes to rev its engine and you'll be rewarded with warm pear and apple aromas. The palate is equally nice as it focuses on apple, pear and peach flavors.

103234,Spain,"It's not easy assessing this blend of Monastrell and Petit Verdot from a warm vintage. It's fiery and almost citric on the nose, while the palate is ripe as can be, with spicecake and blackberry syrup flavors. It's not missing any potency or ripeness, but the longer you work with it the larger and more medicinal it gets. Think big Zinfandel from California when you take this on.",Monastrell / Petit Verdot,89,36,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Pico Madama
103263,Spain,"Roasted and rubbery smelling, this has heavy oak influence that yields notes of mint and shoe. Shearing on the palate despite its body, this has flavors of oak-based vanilla, mint and sweet-and-sour plum. Prieto Picudo is a difficult grape to make into good wine.",El Médico,83,37,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Prieto Picudo,Bodegas del Paramo

103270,Spain,"Oily on the nose, this has a distinct whiff of matchstick and popcorn. It feels dry—like almond skins—with oily flavors of walnuts and white fruits. The finish is marked with a mild bitterness as well.",Unus Old Vine,83,10,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Macabeo,Agustín Cubero

103291,Spain,"Some Barbier wines, depending on when you catch them, are fresh, pleasant and overdeliver. Others are dull and dead. This one falls into the first category with its melon, apple and Asian pear aromas and flavors. It's lithe, light in body and clean. Good as it gets for $6.",Mediterranean White,86,6,Catalonia,Catalunya,NA,White Blend,René Barbier
103296,Spain,"This seems like the best bet among the Tempra Tantrum lineup. The nose has vibrancy and good fruit content, while the palate is sizable and shows solid balance.

103300,Spain,"Applesauce aromas are open and inoffensive, and the palate is wet and refreshing, with crisp, dry green apple and generic white fruit flavors.

103301,Spain,"Light raspberry and plum aromas feature a side note of citrus peel, while the flavors are pure but rudimentary dark berry, plum and herb.

103309,Spain,"Emilio Moro's first foray into the land of value-priced wine is good but nothing special. The nose is brambly and dusty, like the inside of a Topps baseball card package.

Overall it's typical of a solid but average red wine.",Finca Resalso,85,15,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto Fino,Emilio Moro
103310,Spain,"Condensed, syrupy cherry aromas are a little candied, while the palate is acidic and angular, with juicy, tomatoey cherry and plum flavors.

103312,Spain,"A mildly baked wine with a touch of raisin, brine and stem on the nose. The palate is grabby, with firm tannins and core flavors of cherry, blackberry and dry oak.

103318,Spain,"Strawberry and raspberry aromas are a little stalky and stemmy, while the palate is entirely regular in feel, weight and flavor.

103359,Spain,"Slightly saucy on the nose, with jammy, baked fruit aromas hinting at cherry and raspberry.

103361,Spain,"Aromas of Christmas spice, pepper and dried fruit fall more into the traditional category than modern, while the palate is snappy, a little lean and delivers strawberry and raspberry fruit with a light buttery oak note.

Drink now.",NA,87,18,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Godello,Abad Dom Bueno
103410,Spain,"Big, meaty and broad, with thick, masculine coal, pepper and blackberry aromas. This marks a nice comeback for Abadia Retuerta, which had some weak wines in 2002 and '03; this single-vineyard Syrah is lush, loaded and bursting with char, chocolate and deep fruit. It has size, power and balance pulling it in the right direction.

103432,Spain,"This is far and away the best Mirto of all time. It's ripe and brawny, with bacon and black-fruit aromas that put it squarely into the Nuevo Classic mold. In the mouth, licorice and nutmeg flavors give character to smooth blackberry and dark plum flavors, while the finish is cushioned, herbal and long. Immediately appealing but with five to ten years of aging potential.",Mirto,92,65,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Ramón Bilbao
103435,Spain,"Complex and showing so much of what we love about Ribera del Duero. Baking spices, mature fruit and leather grace the stately bouquet, while the palate sings a pretty tune of berries, plum and brown sugar. There's thrust and potency to the mouthfeel but also a toasty, rich, mocha character. Drinking good now but should hold in there for another five to eight years.",Gran Reserva,92,75,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Alidis
103482,Spain,"Berry fruit and mild leather open this good little bargain. There's adequate body and fullness, some oak, and then bright, fresh berry, herb and spice flavors. Finishes dry and lightly toasted, with coffee notes.",NA,86,8,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Maximo
103498,Spain,"Opens with sharp cherry, cola and mint aromas. The palate is fairly acidic and sheering, but it's also zesty and fresh, with clean berry and mild raisin flavors. Offers reasonably good length, with an acidic choppiness balanced by good fruit flavors.",Old Vines Crianza,85,16,Central Spain,Vinos de Madrid,NA,Tempranillo,Merum
103530,Spain,"Mas de Monistrol always seems to please. This rosado is dusty and smoky on the nose, with lightly roasted fruit aromas peeking through. The flavors are more in the cherry and cranberry field, so in terms of mouthfeel it leans toward tangy, racy and pulsing. And who would want it any other way?",MPX Brut Rosé,89,11,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Mas de Monistrol
103539,Spain,"Any fan of sweet Sherry should not turn a cheek against this jammy, figgy, rich wine that could use a cut of ice and citrus peel but isn't at all bad on its own. Aromas of burnt caramel are just right, while the finish dries out long before turning cloying.",Reserve Rare Cream,88,15,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Harveys
103540,Spain,"Spicy strawberries on the nose lead straight to a full-bodied, totally balanced and healthy palate that is eager to deliver zesty raspberry and tea-like flavors. Not hard to enjoy, with peppery rosé tannins and good length. Freshness is key to this wine, and as of June 2007 it was drinking perfectly. Imported by Freixenet USA.",NA,88,14,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Rosé,Fra Guerau
103542,Spain,"Smooth on the nose, with baked-fruit aromas along with touches of forest and mineral. For a previously untried Monastrell from southern Yecla, we like the wine's light fruit character and apple-skin tannins. Finishes with spice and cinnamon. Drinking very well now.",Trapío,88,NA,Levante,Yecla,NA,Monastrell,La Purísima
103545,Spain,"Always one of Catalonia's more elevated cavas, this version opens with spiced dried apple aromas and a bit of yeast and dough. The palate is both sweet and tangy, with tangerine as the lead fruit. And the finish is consistent and moderately deep. A handsome wine with character. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Reserva Heredad Brut,88,20,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
103547,Spain,"As long as the price keeps creeping up on this wine, we're happy to say that the quality seems better and the oak level lower than in past years. This version of Milmanda offers roasted corn, walnut and other smoky, barrel-based aromas. Throughout the fruit is shy but the mouthfeel and oak are smooth. Finishes with a blast of white pepper and toast.",Milmanda,88,53,Catalonia,Conca de Barberà,NA,Chardonnay,Torres
103571,Spain,"An idiosyncratic wine, offering a yeasty orange marmalade aroma followed by a razor-sharp palate with sour citrus and apricot flavors. It's grating and citric on the finish, with a yeasty offset.",999 Brut Nature Rosé,82,15,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Loxarel
103572,Spain,"Heavy and dark in color, this is stalky on the nose, with a compost component that doesn't scream “fresh and ready.” It feels fairly snappy, but it tastes tart and slightly vegetal before finishing with rhubarb flavors.",Brut Rosé,82,12,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Trepat,Mas Fi
103573,Spain,"A tight note of spearmint defines the nose. The palate follows suit: It's pinched and hard, with outsized acidity leading to a lemony palate, with searing cherry and red plum flavors. It doesn't waiver on the finish.",Castell de Raimat,82,10,Catalonia,Costers del Segre,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon,Raimat

103591,Spain,"The name means “Sea of Vines,” and that's what you see in Rías Baixas. Here, we have a dry, crisp white with apple and apricot on the nose and a bit of roundness, weight and chunkiness in the mouth. Tastes of pithy apple and apricot, with mild bitterness on the finish. Drink now.",NA,85,15,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Mar de Viñas
103592,Spain,"Dry and not all that fruity up front, with a blast of oak. The palate shows weight and bold acidity, which pumps up the lemon, apple and pineapple flavors. A bit sour, scouring and sharp, but also cleansing and fresh. Blunt white wine.",Cuesta Del Aire,85,15,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Sauvignon Blanc-Verdejo,Storks' Tower
103601,Spain,"Dark in color, with aromas of bacon fat, blackberry candy and vanilla. The body is medium to full, with grabby tannins that support mildly medicinal blackberry and cherry flavors. Finishes clean and regular, with no nasty residue or forced oak.",Codice,85,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tinto Fino,Dominio de Eguren
103606,Spain,"A tutti-frutti nose leans toward candied cherry and red plum, while the palate is lean, a touch shrill and tastes of lightly herbal red fruits. Nothing heavy or weighty here; it's a simple, perfectly good everyday Rioja with a hint of oak.",NA,85,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Darien
103611,Spain,"A rough, raw wine from Galicia that starts with a swirl of hard fruit aromas, heat and chemical. The palate is jacked up with berry fruit, tannic bite and power, and the finish is chewy and rugged. Packed with color and flavor but also aggression. Definitely not for everyone.",Barrica,85,23,Galicia,Ribeira Sacra,NA,Red Blend,Abadía da Cova
103612,Spain,"Neutral, clean, good white wine for the money. The nose features green apple and lemon, and the low-octane body shows brine, citrus fruit flavors and pithy notes. White grapefruit and orange flavors carry the simple finish to a good ending.",Mesta,85,7,Central Spain,Uclés,NA,Macabeo-Moscatel,Bodegas Fontana
103616,Spain,"Light, simple and ready to drink. More acidic than some, with a cleansing, almost sour flavor package of green apple and lemon. Shows a lot of unabsorbed acidity on the finish, which forces the wine toward being crisp and minimalist. Drink now.",NA,85,18,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Pazo San Mauro
103682,Spain,"Aromas of rubber, smoked beef, syrupy berry and buttery oak are inviting enough, while the palate has edgy acidity that pushes the wine's black cherry element while cutting an obvious oak dosage. Accents of tea, herbs and spice give it character; finishes with an obvious kick of butter and resin.",NA,87,28,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto Fino,Emilio Moro
103686,Spain,"A little saucy and leathery on the nose, but there's also licorice, blackberry and woody aromas to ponder. Flush and well composed on the palate, with plum, raspberry and mild salty, savory notes. Finishes with good feel but a slight herbal taste of tomato and/or oregano.",Crianza,87,30,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Qumrán
103688,Spain,"Bursts with bright, linear cherry and raspberry aromas and flavors, but it's not caustic, sharp or grating. Acidity at peak power yields a zesty, racy personality while a blanket of vanilla flavor softens the cherry and raspberry fruit. Crisp and a good food wine.",Crianza,87,22,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Vallobera
103698,Spain,"Dark purple in color, with can't-miss aromas of prune and raisin. The palate is predictably soft, with manageable heft but low acidity and thus very soft edges. Flavors of baked black fruits are warm but short, and the oak is plentiful. A little too ripe and raisiny to rate higher.",Predicador,86,37,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Benjamin Romeo
103700,Spain,"Nice value red wine with solid black fruit aromas, licorice and crushed mineral notes. It's flush and showing good volume, and the plum/berry core flavors have a vanilla accent. Mildly medicinal on the finish but overall it offers good power, structure and concentration.",Los Dos Old Vines,86,8,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Grenache-Syrah,Almira
103724,Spain,"Powerful and precise, but with a cloudy color. On the nose and in the mouth this aged version of the venerable Drysack shows considerable freshness, tang and complexity. It's edgy yet deep, with caramel and mushroom notes going head to head with acidic intensity. Sherry is rarely more balanced than this; it's lively and rich, balanced yet racy.",Drysack Solera Especial Sweet Old Oloroso Aged 15 Years,92,25,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Williams & Humbert
103727,Spain,"For a few years running we've been singing the praises of Abadal, a label from Catalonia that has been producing hit upon hit. This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah from the excellent 2001 vintage is in super form; the wine has a ripe, integrated nose of cocoa, dark fruit and chocolate, while the palate is bold and loaded with vivacious cherry and blackberry flavors. From front to center to back, this wine has it all going in the right direction. Good now through 2012.",Abadal Reserva,92,23,Catalonia,Pla de Bages,NA,Red Blend,Masies d'Avinyo
103774,Spain,"A floral, heavy style of blended white made from Macabeo, Gewürztraminer and Chardonnay. It has an exotic streak to the aromas along with smoked ham, fennel seed and gardenia. The palate is thick and tastes of papaya, salami and baked apple. It's a hodgepodge of abnormal aromas and flavors, but all totaled it works pretty well.",Mesache Blanco,85,11,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,White Blend,Bodegas Pirineos
103831,Spain,"For the most part this is smooth, ripe red wine. At 50% Cabernet and 50% Merlot the flavors and style should be familiar, but still this wine has its own Catalonian personality. It's concentrated and ripe but not all that heavy. Overall it's very Mediterranean/mountainous and not very New World at all. A fine match for good food.",Abadal Crianza,88,15,Catalonia,Pla de Bages,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Masies d'Avinyo
103833,Spain,"Dry, pure and attractive on the nose, with crisp apple and lemon-lime flavors. This wine performs on an even keel from start to finish, and it's dry, tangy and correct as far as brut nature cavas go. Verges on elegant.",Brut Nature Gran Reserva Cava,88,15,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Sparkling Blend,Sumarroca
103838,Spain,"Savory mint and herbal aromas accent leafy, classic red fruit on the bouquet, while plum, berry, mineral, black olive and herbs work the palate. The wine transitions from one stage to the next without much trouble, and within the folds there are some complexities. A measurable step up from the bargain barrel milieu.",Cune Crianza,88,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,CVNE
103844,Spain,"Tempranillo and Cabernet Franc aren't often thrown together, but here the marriage works. The nose offers herbal, leafy aromas from the CF, while berry fruit and oak carry the rest of the show. The palate is slightly crisp and racy, but its lightweight character is welcome. This is yet another well-made, interesting wine from one of our favorite obscure Spanish labels.",Abadal,88,13,Catalonia,Pla de Bages,NA,Red Blend,Masies d'Avinyo
103845,Spain,"Darker red in color, with a dusty, full bouquet. Flavors of plum, raspberry and apple skins are appealing and on the money, as is the mouthfeel and the fresh, drying finish. There seems to be a little bit of everything running through this cava, and the end result is rock solid.",Brut Rosé,88,17,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Gran Gesta
103850,Spain,"Solid black cherry aromas distinguish this wine from the competition. It has poise for a Madrid wine, and the mix of Tempranillo, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon delivers a saturated palate with natural, full-bodied flavors that aren't too infused with oak. Concentrated and well made, with good size.",NA,88,17,Central Spain,Madrid,NA,Red Blend,Vina Bosquera
103854,Spain,"Pretty pear, apple and other dusty white-fruit aromas start this cleansing cava on its way to pure citrus, Granny Smith apple and lime flavors.

103860,Spain,"A barrel-heavy blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Verdejo? That's what this is, so expect popcorn and bland white fruit along with plenty of acidity. On one hand, it's an angular, sour wine that makes you wonder; on the other hand, it blends toast, butter, baked apple and lemon into a nutty whole that's not bad. Has both merits and faults.",Tríptico,85,25,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Verdejo-Sauvignon Blanc,Storks' Tower
103861,Spain,"Light, floral and almondy, with hints of pear, apple and buttercup on the nose. More creamy and soft than acidic, with pear and vanilla flavors.

103867,Spain,"Dark, fiery, forceful and woody, with aromas of sawdust atop black fruit. The palate is zesty, lively and hard, with biting tannins raising up flavors of blackberry and pepper.

103886,Spain,"Rubber and bacon aromas announce that this wine has some size, depth and concentration along with oak shadings, while the palate is fruity, acidic and tangy, with generic berry flavors and an added dose of oak-driven bacon and rubber. Solid at first and then thin on the finish.",Tinto Figuero 4,85,15,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,García Figuero
103889,Spain,"With good fruit and controlled aromas, it does what young Toro should when done well. Tight in the mouth, with bold black cherry flavors, it bites down with young, big tannins, but it doesn't burn or grate. Shades of mint and chocolate help it along.",Bajoz,85,10,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tempranillo,Pagos del Rey
103899,Spain,Twizzler and other red candy aromas lead to a creamy feeling yet acidic palate that tastes like raspberry extract. Sharp acidity prevents what would otherwise be a cloying wine.,Conde de Valdemar Rosado,81,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Bodegas Valdemar

103960,Spain,"Grassy and pungent, with lime, citrus and white pepper on the nose. Tangy and simple across the palate, with basic pineapple and passion fruit flavors. Good but thins out on the finish, leaving leftover acidity.",NA,86,15,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Mania
103974,Spain,"Lean, focused cherry and raspberry aromas properly portend a snappy, fresh, edgy palate of semitart red plum and raspberry flavors. Buttery oak brings some softness, while the finish is a bit hot and high in acid. More traditional in style than modern.",Crianza,86,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Luis Cañas
104002,Spain,"Dalmau, the ultrapremium Tempranillo blend from Marques de Murrieta, is 65% pricier in 2004 than '03. And that might be justified. This is a spectacular wine in every sense of the word. The nose blends alluring scents of smoke, asphalt, rubber and black fruit. The palate is saturated and smooth, with black cherry and blackberry flavors leading the way. Coffee, berry pie and mocha help the finish hold court and then fade away. Already good but best from 2010–2020.",Dalmau,95,165,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Marqués de Murrieta
104006,Spain,"For the second vintage in a row, Vall Llach's signature red blend is out on its own. The bouquet is round and deep, with alluring cola, mint and blackberry aromas.

Delicious but also deft. 450 cases produced.",NA,95,85,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Vall Llach
104025,Spain,"This is Albariño in fine form. The nose is succulent and marble-smooth, with pure citrus and melon aromas.

104028,Spain,"Big in every way, with tons of new oak, popcorn and coffee sitting on top of dark-fruit aromas. Modern despite its incorporation of several indigenous grapes, this blend delivers a blast of roasted black cherry and plum flavors in front of a resiny finish that's dripping with menthol and molasses. Unique if a touch syrupy; it's clearly shooting for the modern style.",Grans Muralles,91,105,Catalonia,Conca de Barberà,NA,Red Blend,Torres
104030,Spain,"Charcoal, cola and licorice are all components of this wine's dark and meaty nose. And the palate hardly disappoints; there's depth and harmony to the berry, coffee and mocha flavors. It feels good and has just enough kick to keep you thinking. A really nice crianza that will settle and only grow more complex over the next few years.",Crianza,91,24,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Peñagudo
104031,Spain,"A bit of choppy wood announces a fully oaked wine, and yes, it's a touch hard-coated. But underneath the veneer of barrel there's lively red fruit and a natural brambly character. The palate is just acidic enough to be lively, and the finish is healthy and settles upon chocolate due to the wine's generous oaking. Very good mouthfeel and depth make this more than solid.

104038,Spain,"Honey and corn syrup aromas tell you this is rich, but what you don't realize so easily is how complex and expansive this Muscat is. The flavors of honey, banana and clover start out as sweet and unctuous, but then they unfurl to show depth, complexity and length. In the end you realize that this is all about pure, unrefined power and purity. Drinking it is like a rush of natural sugar to the brain.",Casta Diva Cosecha Miel,91,29,Levante,Alicante,NA,Muscat,Bodegas Gutiérrez de la Vega

104071,Spain,"Sweet, open and floral, like a Malvasia or Moscatel. For a clear, easy quaffer this is nice. It tastes like lime and lychee, and also a little bit like applesauce. Nothing special in terms of finish or intensity, but for a light, tropical white wine it gets it done.",NA,85,9,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Viura-Chardonnay,Las Valles

104133,Spain,"Vionta aims for the racy, lively style of Albariño, and for the most part it nails it.

104147,Spain,"May be getting old but still welcoming and mostly fresh. Citrus, melon and mango flavors are flush and clean, and the finish is racy and fluid.

Drink now for best results.",Turonia,88,20,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Quinta Couselo
104160,Spain,"Rooty, tough aromas are brambly, while the palate is narrow in feel, drying and tastes of herbal raspberry and cherry. Quite snappy and a little sharp, with a quick finish of red fruit, tomato and zest.

104164,Spain,"Smells a bit cheesy and sour at first, and soon after oak and mild berry fruit take over. On the palate, it's dry, peppery and grabby, with solid but common plum and raspberry flavors.

104176,Spain,"For a Priorat red, this is lean and snappy, with hot, stemmy aromas and light-bodied, racy fruit flavors. It's a blend of six different grapes, and overall it comes across just well enough to be worth a go. That said, it is kind of short and scratchy given its domain.",NA,85,15,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,La Ninota
104179,Spain,"Dark in color but a bit hot and clunky on the nose, where oak-based vanilla helps mask its true identity, which is choppy and tart.

104189,Spain,"A touch stalky on the nose, but after that it gets things mostly right. The fruit aromas and flavors are subdued, with jammy raspberry notes leading the way.

104250,Spain,"An improvement from recent years, but that may be a reflection of when we're tasting the wine. At this point in time it's showing dusty plum and raspberry aromas and good body weight. The flavors of raspberry and cherry are solid, while the finish is cleansing. Beyond palatable; it's really a nice rosé from Tempranillo.",Rosado,86,12,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Vilano
104252,Spain,"For a large-production, simple red wine, this Garnacha-Syrah blend is good.

104258,Spain,"A little heat on the nose is acceptable given that the remaining cherry and plum aromas are pure.

Cleansing due to higher acidity, with hints of mocha and mineral.",NA,86,10,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Grenache,Quo
104278,Spain,"Opens with tight black cherry and raspberry aromas, but also a whiff of pine and chemical.

104314,Spain,"Méntrida is an island wine region in the middle of central Spain, and this blend of Garnacha and Syrah is lively, juicy and delicious.

104318,Spain,"So thick and rich that it seems to fall apart in the mouth in pieces.

104319,Spain,"A clear step up from the overdone 2003 Propiedad, this vintage is sweet and easy to like. There's a blast of hickory smoke on the new-oak nose, but also black fruit and molasses.

104331,Spain,"These are the kinds of Best Buys we love. In the case of Muruve's '04 crianza, the wine overdelivers by a sum and a half. The nose brims with cola, tar, menthol and other dark aromas, while the big but balanced palate delivers a belt of blackberry and plum flavors along with chewy, ripe tannins. Good now with grilled meat, but will age for another five years should you want to invest in more than one bottle.",Crianza,91,15,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Muruve
104339,Spain,"Fruit overload and gumball richness define the syrupy, super ripe nose on this Monastrell (Mourvèdre) Cabernet Franc blend from Valencia. This is big stuff, with blackberry, prune and chocolate cake qualities. It's thick, intense, tannic and will continue to be lively and drinkable for another six or seven years. A surprise wine; 100 cases produced.",Minimum,91,65,Levante,Valencia,NA,Monastrell,Bodegas Rafael Cambra
104370,Spain,"Light in color and more neutral and clean smelling than anything. The palate is airy and offers simple, pleasant melon and pear flavors. About as easygoing as they come; a no-frills white wine that's tasty, lightweight and a bit sweet.",NA,85,11,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo-Viura,Gran Cardiel
104378,Spain,"A bit hard and sharp on the nose, but on the plus side it's clean and direct. The palate follows suit; it's reasonably balanced, with forward strawberry, raspberry and mocha flavors. Dry and quick on the finish, with a mild resiny leftover oak character.",Flos de Pinoso Made With Organic Grapes,85,13,Levante,Alicante,NA,Monastrell,La Bodega de Pinoso
104381,Spain,"Full and sweet smelling, but also a little cidery. The palate is drawn, narrow and citrusy, with grapefruit, passion fruit and orange for core flavors. Finishes citrusy and a touch vapid; overall it shows flashes of elegance but not enough to rise above average.",Isabelino Rosado,85,10,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Tempranillo,Reina de Castilla
104382,Spain,"Light and citrusy on the nose, with hints of spice, sweet cherry and dusty earth. The palate has a drawn, lean feel along with freshness and flavors of red fruits, plum and mild spice. Offers enough good character and power to be worth a go.",Primum Vitae,85,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Vallformosa
104391,Spain,"Sweet and raisiny, and not in the best shape. This mature Rioja is drying in the mouth and a bit overaged already; it tastes of raisin, coffee and spice, but there's a bit of heat and baked character to it as well. For an '04 reserva it's just not as lively and fresh as it should be.",Reserva,84,17,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Conde de Jauregui
104430,Spain,"Some things never change. Put this sturdy, mildly nutty and fairly bright cava on that list. Year after year, the palate remains comfortably sweet and bubbly, but not too much so. And the round apple, pear and lime flavors even bring a shade of spice along for the ride. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Cordon Negro Extra Dry,87,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
104451,Spain,"If all you're after is size, then sign on the dotted line. This blend is a monster that weighs in at 15.5%, so be ready for intensely sweet flavors of grape essence and licorice. To this judge, the wine has a lot of gumption but isn't what I'd want to drink glass after glass, day after day. It's lumbering, heavy but oh so sweet and dessert-like.",Clio Monastrell-Cabernet Sauvignon,87,42,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,El Nido
104458,Spain,"Wet and wild, with raspberry aromas that sweeten into red licorice. The palate is kind of sweet, but it's also sturdy and full of ultraripe, almost sugary Monastrell flavors. You wouldn't call this precise or particular, but works. Drink now.",Rosé,87,10,Levante,Bullas,NA,Monastrell,Lorca
104459,Spain,"For a consistently pleasing brut nature (no added sweetness), Juvé y Camps is one place to turn. This wine is dominated by match stick, apple, pear and light vanilla aromas, which are backed by meet-in-the-middle flavors of citrus, apple and celery. It's a bit sheer and tangy, but it's also genuinely refreshing and not the least bit sweet.",Brut Nature Reserva De La Familia,87,15,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Juvé y Camps
104471,Spain,"Pop the cork and look for a bulky Mencía from the little-known region of Ribeira Sacra in Galicia. The wine has rubber, bacon and plum aromas, and then an enamel-like palate of black cherry and herbs. Tough stuff, but unique.",NA,85,17,Galicia,Ribeira Sacra,NA,Mencía,Rectoral de Amandi
104474,Spain,"Smells earthy, leathery and a bit gaseous before you get to a broad palate of stretched berry flavors, vanilla and herbal notes. There are good points here but also gaps in the wine, including a tomatoey quality to the flavor profile. Improves a bit with airing but still it struggles to make the grade.",LZ,85,18,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Telmo Rodríguez
104477,Spain,"A simple but pleasant Ribera red with berry-cherry aromas. The palate has a staunch, tannic grab to it as well as flavors of raspberry, black plum and earth. A wine that has o.k. length and solidity to the finish.",Tinto Roble,85,12,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Mayor
104479,Spain,"A heavy, briary wine that opens with a full blast of earthy compost and burnt leaves. The palate features pointed berry fruit along with a wall of oaky coconut and vanilla. Creamy on the finish, at least in terms of flavor, with lasting vanilla.",Crianza,85,28,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Peña Roble
104486,Spain,"Woody and dried out, with oak-based spice and burnt elements on the bouquet. The palate is gritty and acidic, with tart, limited, earthy cherry flavors. Not a disaster, but for a $46 wine from a great vintage it isn't offering many reasons to explore it.",Gran Reserva Cosecha,84,46,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Baron De Ley
104565,Spain,"Warm, baked aromas smell of clay and raisin, and later a wave of minty green enters the picture. The palate is sort of lean, with some holes in the fabric, while flavors of wild berry and black fruits fold in a heavier note of molasses. Limited in its virtues; short in complexity.",NA,85,25,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinta Fina,Conde de San Cristóbal
104566,Spain,"A little dusty and spicy on the nose, with pear and apple checking in. The palate has spritz and acidity, while the flavors run sweet with ripe apple, pineapple and tropical fruit. Tastes like orange candy on the finish, with a sugary lasting impression. Good but needs more balance and harmony.",Capricho Val de Paxariñas,85,24,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Godello,Gancedo
104577,Spain,"Dark and powerfully oaked despite its 5-month pedigree. Mint, tar, shoe polish and blackberry work the bouquet, while the palate is structured and tight but also quite dark and woody. Mocha, butter and pepper flavors carry the finish on this healthy and structured wine that may also be too oaky for its own benefit.",5 Meses en Barrica,85,13,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Monteabellón
104585,Spain,"All three Vall Llach wines are stellar in 2005 and get Editors' Choice status. Idus is a big load that starts out sharp and toasty and then quickly settles into a saturated groove of black fruit, licorice, coffee and mocha. It's dark, deep and ripe, with slight mineral underpinnings. Carignan is the lead grape, with Merlot, Garnacha, Cabernet and Syrah filling out the blend.",Idus,93,55,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Vall Llach
104592,Spain,"Conde de la Salceda is owned by the Chivite family of Navarra. The wine straddles the fine line between classic and modern Rioja. The 2004 is the best Conde yet, with smoke, leather and baked plum aromas followed by a silky palate housing lovely dark berry, tobacco and spice flavors. Drink now or hold for another 12 years; it's that versatile.",Reserva,93,50,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Conde de la Salceda
104610,Spain,"Aromatically this is evocative; there's spice, tobacco and dried fruit in addition to classy, balanced oak. The palate dances with cherry, dried plum and earthy spice notes, while the finish is elegant, smooth and features just the right amount of tannic grab. A very nice, true-to-the-terroir type of Tempranillo.",Reserva,91,33,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,12 Linajes
104632,Spain,"With a gold glint and put-together aromas of peach, candle wax, mineral and citrus, this is very nice Albariño that's now fully ripe, mature and drinking at its best. The palate pits juicy melon against dry papaya; it's big, ripe, full and the perfect foil for all sorts of white-friendly foods. Only 1,000 cases made of this reserve-style wine.",Erxebre,90,15,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Condes de Albarei
104677,Spain,"This is an unusual white blend from Mallorca that uses the native Premsal grape along with 15% Muscat. It smells a little funky and sweaty, and while the feel is angular the palate isn't bad. Tastes sort of fruitless, with a bit of green melon. O.K. for a weird wine, but it's hollow and short on flavor.",Quíbia,84,15,Spanish Islands,Vi de la Terra Mallorca,NA,White Blend,Ànima Negra
104679,Spain,"Sweet, candied, minty and easygoing on the nose, then crisp and fresh in the mouth, with basic, stripped-down plum, berry and citrus flavors. Finishes fruity and fresh, with a mild candied sweetness.",Valdemoreda,84,7,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Valdemar
104682,Spain,"Rustic, flat and chemical at first, with offsetting caramel sweetness to the nose. The palate is big and dark, with herbal, candied flavors and a peppery, creamy finish. Not the most pure wine to process but for 85% Alicante Bouschet it's not bad and seems to get better in the glass.",Vergel Joven,84,14,Levante,Alicante,NA,Red Blend,La Bodega de Pinoso
104697,Spain,"A big, jammy youngster with earth and rubber on the nose. Firm, bullish and tannic but also lively, dark-fruited and touched up with bacon. Finishes with heat and bitterness. Meaty and rugged yet still pretty good.",Manon,84,8,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Mano A Mano
104732,Spain,"A bit jumbled early on, and then more open and minerally. The palate is chunky but hollow, with melon and green fruit flavors. Finishes with a touch of citrus and a soft, quick fade. Bland but easy to drink.",NA,84,10,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Sauvignon Blanc-Verdejo,Storks' Tower
104736,Spain,"Initially, lemony aromas and flower notes stir interest, while the palate has a medium-to-full feel and pumped-up melon and floral flavors. But with time it grows softer, more pithy and dull. Ultimately it lacks spine and purity of flavors, but how much can you expect from a $10 La Mancha white?",NA,84,10,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Verdejo,Paso a Paso
104739,Spain,"Ripe apple and nutty aromas suggest some light oak, while the palate is wet at first and then more drawn and dry as it moves along. Flavors of apple and spice are mildly alluring, while the finish is chunky and broad. Made from the uncommon Vijiriega grape and hails from Granada.",Veleta Vijiriega,84,9,Andalucia,Vino de la Tierra Contraviesa Alpujarra,NA,White Blend,Dominio Buenavista
104742,Spain,"Opens with dusty dry-fruit aromas along with weight and rubbery notes.

Dry, quick and herbal on the finish.",Tintico,84,9,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo,Castillo de Monjardin
104748,Spain,"Smells like red licorice nibs and stemmy, candied fruit, while the palate is medium bodied, reasonably well balanced and juicy, with berry and plum flavors. It darkens a bit on the finish, where chocolate notes enter the picture. Good for what is a very regular wine.",Rojo Granrojo,84,9,Central Spain,Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Bodegas Navarro López
104751,Spain,"Dark, bulky and fairly oaky for a wine of modest DNA. The palate is forceful, juicy and high in acidity, while the flavors of grape juice and black plum are semisour, with leftover oak and vanilla dominating the finish. An average wine on its best day.",Solnia,84,9,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Ilurce
104766,Spain,"This Freixenet brand consists of 100% Xarello grapes, and it's nice on the nose and clean as a whistle. Flavors of apple cider, peach and melon are subdued and a bit sweet, while the feel is juicy and tightly wrapped. Nice for a Catalonian white table wine. Imported by Freixenet, USA.",Creu de Lavit,87,15,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Xarel-lo,Segura Viudas
104767,Spain,"A very solid and consistent rosé cava. Opening aromas of spiced fruit, pepper and juicy citrus raise this to a higher level, and the raspberry and nectarine flavors are snappy and sure. A pleasant bubbly with a dash of complexity. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Brut Rosé,87,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
104776,Spain,"Ginger ale and Sprite are the first things that come to mind when you give it a sniff.

Good in a standard way.",Reserva Raventós Brut,87,15,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Codorníu
104778,Spain,"Mostly Garnacha (with 12% Syrah), this Mediterranean-styled wine is locked and loaded on the nose: There's a ton of mineral, sunshine and earthy blackberry aromas. The palate is full with cherry and raspberry, and the acidity is strong enough to keep the wine stable. In the end it's almost lean and perky.",NA,87,10,Central Spain,Almansa,NA,Garnacha,Higueruela
104780,Spain,"More in the Champagne style, meaning the nose is yeasty and toasty, and the color is more gold than pale yellow. The palate offers wholesome apple, lemon and green herb flavors, and the finish is dry and peppery, with some bitterness. Strives for more complexity than most cavas, and it gets there for the most part.",Brut,87,16,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Montsarra
104786,Spain,"The bouquet deals some peach, custard and a slight hint of oak, while the palate runs racy, fresh and citrusy. If you like a fresher style with strong orange and tropical fruit flavors, this is your ticket. It's a controlled wine that meets expectations. With 15% Parellada.",Gran Viña Sol,87,15,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Chardonnay,Torres
104789,Spain,"Ripeness in inland Catalonia is always going to be challenging, so it is no surprise that the wine features snappy red-fruit aromas and flavors, with herbal touches and lots of length. Neither outrageous nor extraordinary; just good wine. 85% Cabernet and 15% Syrah.",Abadal 3.9 Reserva,87,33,Catalonia,Pla de Bages,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,Masies d'Avinyo
104857,Spain,"Racy red wine, with mild bramble and brine aromas to go with spunky cherry-plum flavors. Quite zesty, bright and juicy, but solidly put together and not overly acidic. Even shows a distant chocolaty side, which is not uncommon for young Garnacha.",Cinco Josés - 5 Joes Old Vine,85,8,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Bodegas Aragonesas
104868,Spain,"No one says Verdejo is an ager, but this '08 is fading. The nose is soft and peachy, with weight and vanilla. The palate is equally soft and melony, and the green-fruit flavors are starting to turn mealy. Still good enough, but without much spunk it might be better to wait for 2009.",Fuente Elvira,85,15,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Pedro Escudero
104869,Spain,"How many $5 wines are this good? Not many. The nose is zesty and aggressive but settles and doesn't offend, while the juicy, fresh palate has bright cherry and raspberry flavors. Basic, ripe, clean red wine.",Abrazo del Toro,85,5,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Syrah,Abrazo
104878,Spain,"Aromas of medicinal berry, sucking candy, rhubarb and raspberry are a touch gawky, but the snappy palate of blueberry and boysenberry is good.

104883,Spain,"Dark and spicy, with rubber and baked-fruit aromas giving way to herbs, clove and other alluring spice scents. As might be expected from a wine bearing Alvaro Palacios' signature and approval, the final product is smart and snappy, with blackberry, herbs and barrel char all making themselves noticed. Good now and for the next several years.",La Montesa,90,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Red Blend,Palacios Remondo
104891,Spain,"A firm wine with fine structure and balance. The nose is fiery and rustic early on, then seductive as it opens up. The palate exhibits currents of raspberry, cherry and plum, and below the surface there's vanilla and brown sugar. A smooth operator that shows the Campo Viejo brand in its best light.",Gran Reserva,90,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Campo Viejo
104937,Spain,"Vall Llach Embruix may be the winery's base-level offering but it's no starter wine. Five grapes led by Garnacha are blended to achieve a potent and piercing brew of blueberry aromas, black cherry and cassis flavors, and a rich, chocolaty finish. Modern in style, and making no apologies for it. Equal in quality to the excellent 2004 Embruix.",Embruix,92,34,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Vall Llach
104970,Spain,"Dark and baked on the nose, with rubbery aromas. Strong, strapping and tannic Tempranillo with roasted black fruit flavors and herbal shadings. A rough, tough style with heat and black coffee on the finish.",El Albar Lurton,84,12,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo,François Lurton
104977,Spain,"Smells like air freshener and white flowers. The palate is spongey and a bit low on life, while the flavors lean toward citrus but lack purity and zap, which is further drilled in on the waxy finish. Once upon a time Basa was a leading white value from Spain; lately it has been average at best.",Basa Blanco,84,15,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,White Blend,Telmo Rodríguez
104996,Spain,"Opens with pasty, oaky aromas and very little fruit or clarity. The palate is flat in feel and thick, with woody, medicinal flavors. Finishes with a pile of woodspice and not a whole lot else. Generic and uninspired for the price.",Vendimia Seleccionada,84,28,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Casajús
104998,Spain,"Light on fruit but loaded with mocha and milk chocolate aromas. The palate is lean to average in feel and lightly stewed tasting, with creamy, soupy red berry flavors as the backdrop. Finishes with a persistent baked   flavor and a final dollop of milk chocolate.",Reserva,84,11,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Viña Albali
105030,Spain,"Sweet, candied, oaky aromas get it going, and the palate, while tannic and tough, is thin in its midsection. Flavors of vanilla and marshmallow lead the way, yet the finish falls off fast. Decent wine but shows a forced, candied, oaky personality.",Tinto 6 Meses en Barrica,84,20,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Alidis
105036,Spain,"Chunky and bold smelling, with bulky berry aromas that are o.k. but not alluring or elevated. The mouth and flavors are more of the same; there's tight, dark, tannic berry flavors along with toast and burnt rubber late. Finishes with mild heat and oak-based coconut notes.",Roble,84,13,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Prado Rey
105041,Spain,"The opening runs a bit sour, tomatoey and stemmy, while the palate offers darkness and weight along with savory, herbal flavors that come across earthy and burnt. Tastes as much like tomato paste and herbs as it does berry fruit. Drink now or let it pass.",Bolanda Crianza,84,18,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Red Blend,Saenz-Olazabal
105043,Spain,"Straightforward and clean, with simple cherry and plum aromas. The palate is tart, juicy and a touch citric, with lightweight cherry skin flavors and a cleansing, fresh, somewhat acidic finish. Tangy and sharp, but not bad for the price.",NA,84,8,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo,Vega Sindoa
105051,Spain,"Not bad for a mass-produced wine. The nose has a distinct sweet, candied character that's like marshmallow, and there's also some burnt stem and bramble thrown into the mix. Tastes mildly pickled, stemmy and burnt, with grabby tannins on the finish. 200,000 cases made.",Roble,84,15,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Protos
105054,Spain,"For $7 this white blend from central Spain does about as well as can be hoped for. Transparent in color, with aromas of children's vitamin and apple, it's nothing special but it is wet, drinkable and tasty. Flavors of green apple and citrus lead to a dry, quick finish.",Protocolo,84,7,Central Spain,Tierra de Castilla,NA,White Blend,Dominio de Eguren
105057,Spain,"Catchy name but the wine is basic. The nose is lightly candied with a bit of green and brine. That pickled character translates to the palate, where flavors of cherry and berry are mildly briney. Finishes similarly, with some reedy heat.",NA,84,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Tempra Tantrum
105068,Spain,"This one takes on an orange tint, and the aromas are akin to chocolate, spice cake and even some baked beans. The palate is quite crisp and healthy, with berry fruit, citrus and length. A good wine with a racy, cleansing feel. It's not spectacular but it ranks highly among similar competitors.",Brut Rosé,87,15,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Pinot Noir,Codorníu
105182,Spain,"Reddish in color, with raspberry and other high-toned aromas. The palate is fleshy but clean, with good acidity pushing slightly sweet cherry and raspberry flavors. Finishes with sugar and a good mouthfeel. Gets the job done.",Rosado,85,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Rosé,Ilurce
105191,Spain,"Rubber and berry aromas are solid if standard, while the palate has freshness and bounce along with cherry, raspberry and rubbery latex. Slight amounts of heat and bitterness show up on the finish, but overall this is an entirely functional young wine.",Tinto,85,14,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Torrederos
105201,Spain,"An unusual wine made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Tempranillo, Syrah and Merlot. It's floral but underdeveloped, with volatility and stunted fruit. The palate has punch and size but also saucy, herbal flavors and a leathery, salinic finish. Shows flashes but it doesn't dance in the mouth.",Leva Daniel's,85,42,Levante,Alicante,NA,Red Blend,Joaquín Gálvez Bauzá
105203,Spain,"A consistent wine from year to year that's made in a friendly, mass-appeal style. It's not so pungent and citrusy like some Verdejo; instead it's more peachy, sweet and melony. Soft on the finish but with just enough acidity to get it through the year.",NA,85,10,Central Spain,Tierra de Castilla,NA,Verdejo,Tapeña
105206,Spain,"A bit murky and damp on the nose, with brandied fruit and raisin aromas. The palate is solidly formed, with basic raspberry flavors but not much follow through as the finish shows buttery, soft flavors. Inoffensive but more generic than individual.",NA,85,22,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Red Blend,Atalayas de Golbán
105207,Spain,"Nectarine and citrus aromas are solid, while the palate is more racy, sharp and linear than some, with narrow, semisour flavors of lemon and orange. Decent feel, maybe a little high in acid, and showing a pithy bitterness on the crisp finish.",Cuatro Rayas,85,14,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Agricola Castellana
105226,Spain,"Varietal Graciano will never fit into the mold of “tried and true,” but this 2004 from top-level producer Contino shows the grape in its most positive light. The nose is natural, with hints of cola and ripe berries. The feel is brawny and intense, with semi-searing acids offset by ripe tannins. Finishes well, with a cleansing wave of red fruit and citrusy flavors. More of a novelty than anything, but a fine wine in and of itself.",Single Vineyard,91,138,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Graciano,Contino
105227,Spain,"Past vintages of Imperial Gran Reserva have seemed sharp and dilute; not the 1998, which is resolute in its delivery of cumin, root beer and subtle raspberry aromas. The palate has nice primary cherry and berry flavors, solid tannins and welcome but not overwhelming acidity. Notice a touch of dill and butter on the finish, a reflection of traditional American oak aging.",Imperial Gran Reserva,91,70,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,CVNE
105304,Spain,"Smells roasted and stemmy, with a burnt leaf and turned earth quality to the bouquet. Herbal, scratchy berry and plum flavors feel rough and don't exhibit enough freshness. Simply put: it's a leafy, muddled Ribera wine.",Torre de Golbán Crianza,83,17,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto Fino,Atalayas de Golbán
105308,Spain,"Mealy and heavy smelling, but with decent background fruit aromas and sweetness. Frankly, this already seems to be past its prime, evidenced by creamy, flat flavors of bland fruit and caramel. The finish needs snap and crispness but doesn't have any; a bit too sweet, candied and bitter already.",NA,83,8,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Rosé,Borsao
105318,Spain,"Heavy and nutty, almost like movie popcorn. In due time the nose transitions to creamy berry and cranberry. The palate is soft and muddled, with some citrus and red apple. Sweet and tomatoey on the finish; needs more focus, acidity and dryness.",Cabernet Sauvignon Rosado,83,20,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Rosé,Enate
105319,Spain,"A bit sharp, stemmy and sour smelling. But the fruit flavors are solid and the herbal cherry and plum character that leads the palate improves with airing. Herbal on the finish; standard as a whole.",NA,83,11,Levante,Yecla,NA,Monastrell-Syrah,Evine
105329,Spain,"This warm-climate Viura hits with plodding barrel aromas and flavors but there's not a lot of high-quality natural material to support that much faux/forced oak. Along the way it hints at mealy apple, spice, cinnamon powder and resin. A lot of noise but not much music.",Blanco,83,8,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Viura,Borsao
105363,Spain,"Candied fruit and punch bowl aromas are not what you'd call sophisticated, and the mouth pretty much follows suit with tart, rubbery raspberry fruit that comes on a bit hot and raw. Tough but with full flavor; sort of like chewing on a plum skin.",NA,84,12,Galicia,Ribeira Sacra,NA,Mencía,A Fuga
105371,Spain,"Lean, dry aromas of cherry skins and citrus lead to a competent but basic palate of raspberry and cherry flavors.

105374,Spain,"Vivid pink in color, with dusty, easygoing raspberry aromas. The palate is a bit soft and low in acidity, which indicates that this is the year to drink the wine...and as soon as possible. Flavors of cherry and strawberry are regular, if a touch bitter toward the finish.",Rosado,84,11,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Garnacha,Casita Mami
105378,Spain,"By no means is this the best wine from Pedrosa; it has decent red berry aromas, but what you really get is minty, forward oak. The palate has an acidic tang to it that suggests medium ripeness, while flavors of cherry tomatoes, herbs, vanilla and mint take you only so far. More barrel than substance here.",Crianza,84,NA,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Pedrosa
105380,Spain,"Minty-grassy top aromas indicate that the wine, while endowed with decent berry character, has an herbal side as well. In the mouth, it's hard, lean and compact, with tart cherry/plum flavors and a quick finish.

105387,Spain,"Opens with a blast of hot, basic red fruit that's fiery and a little pickled. The palate is lean and acidic but doesn't burn, while the cherry and red plum flavors are elementary. Inoffensive, highly regular red wine.",Rojo Granrojo,83,9,Central Spain,Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Navarro López
105450,Spain,"The wines of Abelis Carthago are enigmatic. The lowest-priced Lui is the most balanced and complete. This wine, William, is dark and dense, with shoe polish and raw crude oil on the nose. It's super strapping and tannic, with bitter chocolate and coffee notes carrying the racy palate to a fiery finish. It lacks nuance and subtlety but will augment a good steak with nary a problem.",William Selection,90,34,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Abelis Carthago
105474,Spain,"Caramel, molasses and spice aromas make this a totally approachable and familiar type of Sherry. The palate offers a round but zesty attack, with flavors of caramel, coffee, toffee, baked apple and orange peel. For the most part it's racy and fresh, but finishing mushroom and pepper notes give it added character.",Premium Oloroso Medium 10RF,90,16,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Osborne
105478,Spain,"There's no denying the wine's core strengths, which start with the bouquet's campfire and prune qualities and extend onto the palate, where peppy raspberry and plum flavors take over. This is a complete, stylish Rioja that's about halfway through the aging process. It's still juicy and agile, with licorice and raisin notes adding some sweetness. Drink now–2016.",Gran Reserva,90,38,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Ramón Bilbao
105479,Spain,"Ripe, jammy and forward, Prima could become the blueprint for affordable but well-made Toro wines. It's a modern bruiser from a modern, spotless facility, and it offers a clash of wild berry flavors, big-time tannins and powerful acidity. Like most Toro wines, it'll take your cheeks to the cleaners if you don't have meaty foods, cheese or lots of water to go with it. Drink now through 2012.",Prima,90,18,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Maurodos
105498,Spain,"Mildly horsey on the nose, with alfalfa, reedy fruit and grilled beef aromas.

105520,Spain,"Arguably on the heavy and rich side, but if you like chocolate, spice and pretty good pop across the palate, this is recommended.

Should come together nicely over the next two years.",Crianza,91,26,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Costaval
105536,Spain,"This represents Torres' highest effort in Priorat, and it's a success. Perpetual deals freshly laid asphalt, cola and grilled char on the nose and then follows that up with black cherry, cassis and tobacco flavors. It's pure and ripe more than intellectual. Best 2009–2013; 60 cases produced.",Salmos Perpetual,91,52,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Torres
105608,Spain,"Heavy aromas of orange marmalade and honey come across as unconvincing. The palate follows suit with bland, soft, chubby cantaloupe and green melon flavors. Finishes soft and dilute; seems like it's already dying in the bottle.",NA,83,13,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Vega Murillo
105610,Spain,"Rough and leathery, with roasted black fruit and burnt-leaf aromas. The palate has a clacky, sharp feel and flavors of dried, baked berry fruits and leaves. Hard, roasted and leathery red wine.",Crianza,83,11,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Albali
105616,Spain,"Lean raspberry and cherry aromas are the best part because the palate is rather raw and acidic, which causes raspiness and a tough mouthfeel. Flavors are sharp and red fruited, and there's an oak and vanilla element that's not that well integrated.",Selección,82,9,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo,Fundatio
105617,Spain,"Expensive for what you get. The nose is a weird mix of salami and sweetness, and the palate is a syrupy, globular blend of cloying oak, caramel syrup and candied banana. Way too much wood and vanilla here, and not nearly enough balance or purity.",Blanc de Montsalvat,82,40,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,White Blend,Francesc Sanchez Bas

105634,Spain,"This catchy named, three-grape blend is a nice wine that's sinewy and leathery; overall it ranks as a natural and controlled reflection of Jumilla.

105637,Spain,"Dill and butter aromas announce aging in American oak, while the berry aromas are solid but common.

105660,Spain,"Same score as the prior year, and pretty much the same wine. It's dusty and slightly burnt in aromas and flavors, with banana, peach and pithy bitterness extending onto the finish.

105663,Spain,"Saucy and jammy initially, and then a raisiny quality takes over. Plump and thick in the mouth, but ultra jammy in terms of mouthfeel.

105671,Spain,"Disappointing given Telmo Rodriguez's overall track record. Dehesa Gago 2008 is jumpy, sweaty and stemmy smelling, with weedy, burnt, acrid flavors.

105987,Spain,"Smooth and simple stuff. It's quite fresh and clean, with more citrus and cherry than what you'd get from a Catalonian Pinot Noir.

106404,Spain,"Typically Navarran in that the nose is green, with herbal aromas along with cherry and heat. The palate has decent weight and feel, but the flavors are rooty and herbal, with a similar finish. Solid but probably more herbal/green than what most people are seeking.",Gamma Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot-Tempranillo,83,9,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Piedemonte
106422,Spain,"A smoky number with vibrant aromas of dried fruits mixed with campfire and molasses. It's integrated and spicy, with cherry, apple-peel and other attractive secondary flavors. With no shortage of power and fine tannins, this wine is approaching its peak and should be good for another five years.",Reserva,90,34,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Campillo
106432,Spain,"Not many wines of this price are pulling legit 90-point scores. But this one deserves it. The wine delivers citrus and piquant green-fruit aromas, which are backed by honeyed melon and lime flavors. The texture is just soft enough to not bite, while the finish is wavy. 10,000 cases made.",NA,90,11,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Valdelainos
106530,Spain,"Lacks freshness; pickled and leathery, with heavy, bruising tannins. Dull, pounding flavors of plum and prune are short and fierce. Rough country wine.",NA,81,9,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Caño
106541,Spain,Seems like it's past its sell-by date. Smells musky and tastes sweet and gummy. Candied papaya and mango is about all you get. Low-pulse stuff.,NA,80,12,Catalonia,Alella,NA,Pansa Blanca,Marqués de Alella
106545,Spain,"Vanilla wafer aromas leave this taster lost. The longer it airs out, the more weird the wine gets. Milk chocolate, vanilla and marshmallow dominate everything from aromas to feel to flavor to finish. A barrel-fermented rosé from Ribera Del Duero: why?",Rosado,80,13,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Rosé,Prado Rey
106547,Spain,"Probably not to everyone's liking, but this oak-fermented Verdejo is a bit like Burgundy and/or white Bordeaux. Cured meat, match stick and pineapple-lemon aromas work their way onto the mildly oaky nose, while the palate has a vanilla-based lushness that works well. Rich, opulent and classy. A sincere food wine.",Hermanos Lurton Cuesta de Oro,91,35,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,J. & F. Lurton
106548,Spain,"Grapefruit, melon, lime and match stick aromas give this Rueda a solid opening. The palate is fruity and a bit green and phenolic, with flavors of green melon, grass, cucumber and tangerine pith. Simple and clean on the finish.",Hermanos Lurton,87,15,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,J. & F. Lurton
106562,Spain,"We've tried this nonvintage brut cava for three years running, and it has registered similarly each time. It's a touch flat in terms of feel but the lemon-lime aromas and flavors are solid, if unspectacular. Overall, the wine is fine, with no major faults.",Brut,85,13,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,1+1=3
106565,Spain,"The hefty nose forces out spice and mildly-baked aromas of blackberries, while the palate delivers legitimate berry flavors touched up by accents of dill and butter. The finish is expansive and drying, with solid tannins. This is the best of what's on offer from Bodegas Los Llanos.",Pata Negra Gran Reserva,85,15,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Los Llanos
106566,Spain,"A simple, crisp and slightly stripped-back wine. The nose has red fruit, leather and light wood, while the palate races with cranberry and red cherry flavors. Overall it is fairly sheer and drying, but it will accent food without much effort.",ía Crianza,85,11,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Garnacha,Bodegas Virgen del Águila
106568,Spain,"The nose begins with wheat grass and chopped chive before folding in peach, clover and honey. The palate runs toward melon, pear and green herbs, while the finish is dry, crisp and perfectly solid. As a whole, it's an easy, straightforward, mass-market cava that gets it more right than wrong.",Original Brut,85,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Codorníu
106655,Spain,"Consistency is apparently not Fransola's calling card. One year it's pungent and green, and then in a warm year like 2006 it's fruity, ripe and sweet, with green apple, pear and tropical fruit flavors making their mark. Seems like Sauvignon Blanc in Catalonia needs ample heat to show the ginger, lime and apple characteristics that make it a likable. In this case, that's mostly what's on display.",Fransola,88,29,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Sauvignon Blanc,Torres
106659,Spain,"Crushed floral aromas, berry-infused tea and cherry candy aromas give this wine a sweet profile. The palate, however, is anything but. It pounds with toasty black fruit, licorice and fiery menthol. The feel is a bit tannic but not terribly harsh, so maybe another three to five years will serve it well.",Volvoreta Probus,88,25,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Nuntia Vini
106663,Spain,"The essence of 2005 is captured in this creamy, rich offering that touches up against overripe but pulls back into balance at the last moment. Expect soft tannins, lots of coconutty oak and molasses notes along with a limited but easygoing finish. Drink soon.",y Llanahermosa,88,45,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Montecastro
106666,Spain,"A solid wine with mineral, white pepper and waxy fruit aromas. The palate is ripe and bulky, but also acidic enough to be balanced and stylish. Pineapple is the forceful flavor, while the finish is full and slightly oily. Drink this fruity, bigger-framed Albariño now.",NA,88,22,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,A2O
106667,Spain,"Abelis Carthago's top wine, Fighting Bulls, is also its toughest to enjoy. There's overripeness and barnyard on the nose, and thus the prune, black plum and jammy berry flavors that control the palate are not surprising. Big and forceful for sure, but also choppy and incongruent across the palate.",Fighting Bulls,88,60,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Abelis Carthago
106668,Spain,"Ripe and honeyed, but also nicely balanced by flower blossom aromas and acidic zest on the palate. For straightforward apricot and peach flavors, this wine serves its purpose. It's smooth, sweet and easygoing, and overall it's just elegant and lively enough to jostle your palate.",Miguel Asensio Vino Dulce de Moscatel,88,22,Spain Other,Spain,NA,Moscatel,Asensio
106673,Spain,"Early aromas of wintergreen, pepper and autumn leaves are joined by plum and cherry sweetness on the palate. The wine opens fairly quickly into a bright, juicy, lively package that offers grabby tannins, a touch of coarseness and zest. Should drink well for the next four or five years.",Selección de Familia,88,16,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Faustino
106677,Spain,"There's no denying the wine's raisiny ripeness; it's confirmed via Sherry/Port aromas and black plum/baked fruit flavors. But it's not simply a heavyweight on its last legs. To the contrary, the wine delivers a jolt of core intensity and finishing notes of spicy black pepper and licorice. Drink right away.",Reserva,88,19,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marqués de la Concordia
106863,Spain,"Jané Ventura is known for its sparkling cavas, but this table wine from Xarello, Muscat and the obscure Subirat Parent grape is appealing because it doesn't bite off more than it can chew. There's no oak so what you get is lean, tranparent lemon and lime flavors and a ready mouthfeel. Interesting but not for everyone.",NA,85,11,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,White Blend,Jané Ventura
106868,Spain,"This vintage seems lighter on its feet than previous versions, but it's still a strange, atypical wine made from Garnacha Blanca and other Priorato white varieties. The bouquet is heavy and dusty, while the palate is thick and woody, with white pepper, peach and melon notes. Pithy bitterness weighs down the finish. Unusual but stirs interest.",Blanc de Montsalvat,85,45,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,White Blend,Francesc Sanchez Bas
106874,Spain,"Smooth, savory and spicy, but with enough red-fruit character to ensure that it doesn't taste dull. The palate offers orderly berry and pepper flavors, while it ends with vanilla and a hint of campfire. Juicy and fairly fresh, but a little thin and watery across the palate. Imported by W.J. Deutsch & Sons.",Crianza,85,11,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Montecillo
106879,Spain,"This seems to be an attempt to mock the Moscato d'Asti style from Italy, but it doesn't quite pull it off. The nose is powdery and full of gardenias, but the feel is thick and it doesn't have that clean, ethereal personality that the best Moscatos exhibit. Not a bad wine by any means, and probably best with desserts.",Flare Método Charmat,84,12,Levante,Valencia,NA,Moscatel,Anecoop
106881,Spain,"Nothing to swoon over but much better than the label's unpalatable 2005 and '06 wines. This has warm, earthy, mulchy aromas of baked fruit and cola, while the palate is a touch burnt to the taste, leaving caramel to mingle with raspberry. Not a bad midlevel wine if you catch it on a good day.",Sombrero Rojo Crianza,84,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Barriosa
106882,Spain,"Opens with spice notes of cinnamon and anise before transitioning to fuller cherry and plum flavors. The mouthfeel is warm and fatty, while the finish still holds some buttery notes and tannic grip. Nothing spectacular but not bad for a 1999 wine from Valdepeñas.",Señorío de los Llanos Gran Reserva,84,13,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Los Llanos
106898,Spain,"Blackberry and bramble work the nose, with a medium-bodied, generously oaked palate to follow. In the mouth, buttery oak leads the way with dark fruit, wood resin and chewiness coming next. Not overly tannic, but short on the finish. Pretty easygoing as a whole.",NA,85,16,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Monte Negro
106910,Spain,"Freshness is in demand as the nose shows dampness, tobacco and wood more than bright fruit. In the mouth, there's oak-driven flavors of vanilla and tobacco accenting basic red fruit. Has a lot of snap and zest but comes off kind of thin and on the mature side. Drink now for best results; its lifespan appears limited.",Crianza,85,28,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Monte Negro
106911,Spain,"Almost jolting in how the nose differs from the competition. Here, you get an early blast of rhubarb and wet dog along with herbal strawberry. Never does the wine shed that herbal character, so at all points there's a touch of tobacco, bell pepper and bramble.",Crianza,85,44,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Pago de Carraovejas
106913,Spain,"Coffee, wood grain and berry fruit combine to create a standard trio of aromas, while the palate is medium in weight, with strawberry, raspberry and vanilla flavors. This wine offers a reasonably good mouthfeel and finishing notes of coconut, dill and vanilla. Good but ordinary. Imported by Dana Importers, Inc.",Crianza,85,18,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Prado Rey
106917,Spain,"Warm, fruity and full of blackberry aromas as well as touches of citrus peel. The palate is lean and firm in the middle and tannic on the sides, and it's carrying flavors of raspberry and black cherry. This wine has good stuff but it also runs choppy, jagged and rough. Flavorful but lacks finesse. 50,000 cases made.",Roble,85,13,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Fuentespina
106918,Spain,"Sort of sweet and jammy, but nice overall. The nose is your average young, candied easiness, while the plump berry and plum flavors are pretty much where they should be. Shows juiciness and a spunky mouthfeel, as it was aged only four months in oak.",Tinto Figuero 4,85,20,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,García Figuero
106919,Spain,"Fairly dark and chocolaty on the nose, with some vanilla oak notes that help it along. The mouthfeel, however, is a bit choppy and tangy as red fruit and acidity come up and take over the game. Short on the finish, with oak filling any gaps left by the fading fruit. Good and ready to go now. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Cosecha,85,14,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Valdubón
106953,Spain,"A bigger wine at 14.5%, this offers the full allotment of leather, crude oil, violet petals and cassis. The palate is rich and relaxed, with blackberry, plum and lightly oaked vanilla flavors. It's integrated and smooth, with a touch of wood and caramel well woven into the wine's core fabric. Drink now.",NA,88,14,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Peña Roble
106963,Spain,"The importance of a great vintage is evident in this crianza holdover from the lauded 2001 harvest. The wine is loaded with cola, root beer, molasses and leather aromas, while the flavors of earthy cherry, plum and raspberry are subtle and upright, yet still a touch angular. Will go well with food; drink now.",Crianza,88,22,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Torrederos
106968,Spain,"Classic old-school Gran Reserva. The nose is full of barbecue, molasses and dried plum, while the palate has complexities in the form of tobacco, tire rubber and earth. It goes somewhat citrusy and quick on the finish, ending in a wash of orange-infused leather and chocolate. Drink now or hold for another 5 years.",Gran Reserva,88,25,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marques de Arienzo
106969,Spain,"Dark and sultry on the nose, with aromas of burnt toast and raisin that hint at ripeness and some serious oak aging. The wine is juicy yet also a little creamy, with raspberry and plum flavors that are broad and flow nicely across the palate and onto the wide, chewy finish.",Reserva,88,25,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Ramón Bilbao
106975,Spain,"Quite ripe for a traditional crianza. The bouquet starts out on the stewy side but soon sheds its weight to reveal flavors of blackberry, black cherry and earth. The mouthfeel is a bit creamy due to the wine's mild oak and overall ripeness. Drink now through 2010.",Viña Real Crianza,88,18,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,CVNE
106986,Spain,"Hard aromas of matchstick, bramble and tart fruit don't exactly qualify as friendly, while the palate is grabby and tastes of fruit punch and herbal berry. Short and a touch burnt tasting on the finish. Acceptable, as it leaves you wanting more.",NA,83,11,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Condado de Oriza
106990,Spain,"After many years of singing the praises of Muga's rosé, this vintage seems lacking and sour. The nose is short and quiet, while the palate delivers lean, citric flavors and a sharp, scouring finish. Whets the whistle, but doesn't put a smile on your face.",NA,83,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Rosé,Muga
106998,Spain,"Smells like a dog badly in need of a bath, and alongside those funky aromas there's berry fruit and bubblegum. The palate is forceful and sort of heavy and tannic, with herbal, semitart plum flavors. Bright and lively, but unsophisticated, with poor aromas.",Joven Roble,82,20,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Pago de los Capellanes
107029,Spain,"A slightly heavier version of Verdejo, especially given 2007's cool conditions in Rueda. The wine has waxy peach and papaya aromas follwed by apricot, pineapple and mango flavors. It definitely opens on the palate and then finishes with a fleshy texture, additional fruit and even some nuts. Good complexity yet still a forward type of white wine.",Fuente Elivra,89,14,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Pedro Escudero
107031,Spain,"Dry, smoky and showing a touch of leather, this is a smooth crianza with bright berry flavors, a bit of heft, and well-applied oak that doesn't overwhelm. Black cherry and raspberry flavors are bright, and the vanilla and butter elements are controlled and should subside in due time. Drink now into 2010.",Viña Real Plata Crianza,89,21,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,CVNE
107171,Spain,"Earthy and mossy initially, with notes of coffee and mocha. The flavors of spiced red fruit are solid and fresh, but the wine comes up short on flesh and feel. In fact, it's quite lean and acidic, which means a food partner is almost mandatory.",NA,84,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Puerta Colorada
107172,Spain,"Cola, root beer and herbal fruit carry the nose into a fairly balanced, old-school palate that features crisp cherry, raspberry and citrus flavors. This is made from Tempranillo and it's a bit like an '80s model cru bourgeois Bordeaux.",Reserva,84,15,Levante,Utiel-Requena,NA,Tempranillo,Torre Oria
107176,Spain,"A Tempranillo-Garnacha blend that shows fiery aromas and raspberry followed by sweet and granular plum and red berry flavors. If you like juicy, lively, higher-acid wines, then give this a try. It's not bad for the money and ranks as the type of wine you'd get by the glass in Spain.",Vega Madroño,84,8,Central Spain,Vinos de Madrid,NA,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Vinos Jeromin
107184,Spain,"Opens with scents of pine needle, citrus peel and punch-bowl generic fruit aromas, and it keeps those characteristics on the palate while adding olive and pickle notes. Has good size and texture supporting a mundane flavor profile.",Pintoresco,84,10,Central Spain,Extremadura,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Luis Gurpegui Muga
107192,Spain,"A snappy, jumpy type of wine that delivers aromas of red fruit and spice, but there's something piercing about it, too. The palate is clean and tight, with lots of cranberry/raspberry flavors framed by citrusy notes. Best if you prefer a leaner, shorter, crisper type of red.",Crianza,85,20,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,San Gabriel
107196,Spain,"Black fruit and olive aromas vie for center stage on the nose, while in the mouth there's black cherry but not much nuance or background. Overall, the wine comes across linear and a bit green. And it's brutally tannic as it transitions from midpalate to finish.",Crianza,85,30,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Callejo
107197,Spain,"The muscularity and meatiness of the nose indicate ripeness, while the aromas veer toward drying oak and a bit of raisin. The palate is chunky and dark, with subdued berry flavors front and center. And the weight is up there, especially for a youngster that spent only four months in oak.",Cuatro Meses en Barrica,85,18,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Callejo
107199,Spain,"Not sure why an '03 Joven would still be on the market, but since it is we'll review it. The bouquet deals cinnamon and rubber along with basic berry aromas, while the palate is tangy and racy as it pumps cherry and raspberry fruit. Full on the finish but modest in flavor and style. Still seems fresh and ready to go.",Joven,85,19,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Castillo de Urtau
107207,Spain,"Plenty ripe, in fact it's on the edge of raisiny but not quite over the line. The palate runs surprisingly racy with a lot of acidity, yet the flavor profile is short and drying. Shows a flash or two but it's not a complete wine and not worth the high price tag.",Tinto Figuero 15,84,55,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,García Figuero
107210,Spain,"Drier and lighter than this winery's Crianzas and reservas, Granate shows rubber and red-fruit aromas and then lean cherry flavors. It's rather chalky and grabby late, and by then some of the thrill is gone.",Granate,84,10,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Fuentespina
107215,Spain,"A very smoky, meaty, heavily oaked style of Ribera Del Duero, and one that never reaches a level where the fruit can escape the oak boundaries. Yes, the palate has berry flavors and snap, but there's also a ton of pepper, vanilla and burnt spices that keep it under wraps. And the bet here is that time will not make it better.",Prestigio,84,22,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Corona de Castilla
107251,Spain,"The under-$10 high scorer is fast disappearing, so take a good look at this young, jammy Tempranillo-Shiraz blend that hits nicely with ripe boysenberry and black plum.

107258,Spain,"Cabernet Sauvignon and Monastrell made in a ripe, high-alcohol style results in monster aromas of shoe polish and black licorice.

A lunker wine with a sweet smile and a big handshake.",NA,88,130,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Cabernet Blend,El Nido
107260,Spain,"This wine's nose bears an uncanny similarity to animal crackers, and along the way there's peach and melon aromas. The palate is sweet and slightly punchy, with mango and white raisin flavors. Overall, bank on sweetness and liquidy ripeness from this drink-now Albariño.",NA,88,23,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Fulget
107264,Spain,"Spicy wood notes and black fruit vie for center stage on the ripe, semimature bouquet. This is more of a traditional Ribera wine, meaning it has textured tannins, notes of tobacco and dill, and leathery, earthy berry fruit flavors. Not at all rough and ready to drink now, but still it should hold into 2009.",Reserva,88,25,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Condado de Oriza
107270,Spain,"Clean and focused up front, with appealing cola, cherry and plum aromas. If you like wild berry flavors and juicy, borderline aggressive acidity, then Deyo fits your request. It's a fairly rough, spunky wine with finishing notes of espresso and bitter chocolate. Should match well with salty, robust foods.",Deyo,87,15,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Merlot,Castillo de Monjardin
107273,Spain,"Mature and a little waxy on the nose; this is a plump, fruity, semisoft wine with apple, pineapple and melon flavors. It's round and fairly mild, with plenty of taste, width and drinkability. Drink soon before it softens even further.",El Bino,87,13,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,El Bully
107275,Spain,"Ripe grapefruit aromas take care of the nose, while the palate shows smooth-edged citrus and grapefruit flavors.

Drink now; it's not getting any better.",NA,87,18,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Aura
107289,Spain,"Green and lean Garnacha, with tobacco, celery and other vegetal aromas. Chunky in the mouth, but rather sour tasting, with grassy, green fruit and bite. Not a prime-time player.",Condesa de Sarabella,81,6,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Garnacha,Bodega Virgen de la Sierra
107299,Spain,"Dusty, flat and about half oxidized, this is a bland version of Verdejo that isn't unpalatable but lags behind the field. Hits with a thud; very little life to it.",NA,80,9,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Viña Cantosán
107300,Spain,"Out of balance and lacking freshness on the nose.

107327,Spain,"Torres' Celeste debuted in 2003, and the '05 is the best vintage to date. The wine has penetrating berry and spice aromas and an accent of animal leather.

Comes together well and should be good in the cellar through 2012.",Celeste Crianza,89,22,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Torres
107430,Spain,"A four-grape blend that's a touch rooty and charred up front, while the palate is brighter and juicier as it gives fresh tomato, savory red berry and spice flavors. The more it opens the more grabby and tannic it gets, so expect some good ol' country grip as it goes down.",Reserva,84,16,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Red Blend,Monasterio de las Viñas
107434,Spain,"Light cherry and berry aromas are a bit candied, and the palate is more so. It's almost sugary sweet, but fortunately the wine has good acidity and bounce, so it's not cloying or sticky. Definitely for fans of white Zin and other sweet rosés.",Brut Rosado,84,13,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Grenache,Torre Oria
107445,Spain,"Sweaty and pickled at first, although airing reveals some hidden dark fruit aromas.

107450,Spain,"Dry and spicy on the nose, but also a little cooked smelling. The flavors of this 100% Pinot Noir, but the flavors seem confected as they conjure memories of cherry Coke.

107453,Spain,"The bouquet seems nutty and salinic, and overall this extra dry (meaning fairly sweet) focuses on soft and sugary mango and melon flavors. It's not as lively as it needs to be to balance the sweetness, so ultimately the wine comes up a touch flat. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Aria Estate Extra Dry,84,12,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
107524,Spain,"Light but generic aromas of white fruits and white flowers give this wine a happy bouquet.

107533,Spain,"Just a bit mulchy on the nose, which signals that is a wine from the hot 2003 vintage. The palate sits on raisin and mocha, and there's even a creamy, thick feel to it. If you like rich, Porty flavors that border on dessert, it's likable. But be prepared for it to hit with a thud.",Reserva,87,49,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Alidis
107537,Spain,"Inky dark, with deep berry, sandalwood and sawmill aromas. Color and potency are not lacking in this modern-styled Tempranillo, which hits like a hammer.

107584,Spain,"Light, laudable aromas of wood smoke, cherry, raspberry and licorice are inviting, while the palate is firm but on the precipice of sharp.

107811,Spain,"Termanthia is the pinnacle of Tinta de Toro. Aromas of wild blackberry, crude oil, forest floor and truffles are just now showing themselves, while the tight, tannic palate is full of black plum, blackberry and bitter chocolate flavors. Espresso and roast meat notes grace the dark, jam-packed finish, and as a whole this is one bold, boisterous wine. Best in 2011 thru 2013. Only 531 cases.",Termanthia,95,200,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Numanthia
107828,Spain,"Nice and familiar, and very much in the sweet, creamy style. There's almond candy and caramel on the palate and then maple syrup on the finish. Soft and sweet throughout, with just enough acidity and complexity to save it from being boring.",Oloroso Dulce Cream,87,11,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Osborne
107838,Spain,"This is Cáceres' bread-and-butter red Rioja, and the '04 is fruity, light and very approachable. The nose shows some cotton candy and other bouncy red-fruit aromas, while the palate is easygoing, fleshy and balanced by a beam of juicy acidity. Along the way, you'll pull out flavors of cherry, raspberry and a finishing note of bitter coffee.",Crianza,87,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marqués de Cáceres
107839,Spain,"Superripe, such that it's medicinal and pruny. The nose reeks of reduced blueberry and cassis, while the palate is soft, low in acidity and full of ripe, dark raisin, prune and spice cake flavors. If you like a dense wine, this is it. But expect it to be Port-like and on the liqueur-ish side. Drink now.",Estate Bottled,87,45,Central Spain,Dominio de Valdepusa,NA,Petit Verdot,Marques de Griñon
107842,Spain,"A maturing wine with aromas of burnt leaves, dill, leather and shaded black fruit. It opens up on the palate, revealing cherry, raspberry and plum flavors along with ancillary vanilla. With medium tannins and moderate acidity, the wine shows no ill effects of the broiling 2003 vintage. Drink now.",Crianza,87,15,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Condado de Oriza
107844,Spain,"Cepas Vellas refers to old vines, but what's most noticeable on this wine is the popcorn and cream that characterizes both the nose and mouth. In between the oak-aided folds there's melon, waxy papaya and banana flavors sitting on a plump, cushioned palate. It's a holdover from 2005, so drink it while you have it.",Aquis Celenis Cepas Vellas,87,18,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Fernando Diéguez Otero
107887,Spain,"Black licorice, mint and a hint of raisin work the nose. However, the palate on this venerable Ribera wine is a bit jumpy and early on it seems tart and miserly; the upside is that the wine will age for 15 years. To drink now it'll need to go with food. If given plenty of airing or decanting it'll show its best.",Tinto,88,38,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Pesquera
107894,Spain,"The aromas of sarsparilla, tree bark, dried raspberry and cumin take you back to traditional Rioja winemaking. With lighter-weight fruit, herb and tomato leaf flavors, this is a solid old-school wine that will hit the right marks with tapas or roast meats. It's got some tea and tang as well, courtesy of zesty acids.",Gran Reserva,88,34,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Baron De Ley
108034,Spain,"By the sheer fact that this wine costs $6 and never really goes up in price, it holds onto its tenuous value status via clean tropical aromas and mild flavors of lime, pineapple and citrus. It's a touch hot and burning on the finish, but finish isn't what you're banking on with a wine like this. Imported by Freixenet, USA.",Mediterranean White,83,6,Catalonia,Catalunya,NA,White Blend,René Barbier
108035,Spain,"Dusty and peppery aromas alert you to the fact that this will be a lean, tight ride. The palate delivers on the promise, showing tart cherry and raspberry flavors in front of a wave of vanilla on the choppy, acidic finish. Decent fruit and clean, but lean and clipped.",Superior,83,9,Levante,Utiel-Requena,NA,Tempranillo,Torre Oria
108036,Spain,"Honeysuckle, talcum powder, melon and tangerine all work the nose, while the palate comes at you sweet and almost sticky. Flavors of white fruits and canned peaches are good if that's your thing, while the finish teeters on cloying but manages to hold the line. For a sweet Parellada-Muscat wine it isn't bad. Imported by Altuve Foods and Beverage.",Claudia,83,13,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,White Blend,Vallformosa
108043,Spain,"Stylistically and individually, this is not what this critic is looking for in Albariño. The wine is moderately but noticeably oaked, and seeing that it dates from 2003, it has aged to the point that there's butterscotch and canned-corn aromas reminiscent of warm-climate Chardonnay. Lots of vanilla and butterscotch work the finish, and the acidity seems forced. Not poorly made but not really what Albariño should be.",Granbazán Ambar Limousin,83,35,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Agro de Bazán
108046,Spain,"Lots of charred oak and leathery fruit start it out, and then you get runaway berry flavors and screechy, almost grabby tannins.

Has its good points but not enough of them.",Tempranillo Syrah,83,17,Central Spain,Madrid,NA,Red Blend,Sombrero
108052,Spain,"Transparent in color, with rustic aromas of leather, dried leaves and tea-like berries. The palate is rather thin but refreshing, with red-fruit flavors and a smack of citrus. Might take well to a light chilling.",Señorío de los Llanos Reserva,83,11,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Los Llanos
108058,Spain,"The average American wine drinker is probably not interested in a three-grape white blend from hot and dry Extremadura, Spain, but in case you are, this wine is neutral on the nose and lean on the palate. Flavors of green apple, pineapple and lemon are scouring and seem designed for fried seafood.",Alicena,82,9,Central Spain,Extremadura,NA,White Blend,Viña Santa Marina
108116,Spain,"Dense and dark, with huge black-fruit aromas, toasty oak, chocolate and balsamic notes. Numanthia is ripe, rugged and intense, with in-your-face black fruit, coffee and burnt-toast accents. The feel and finish are deep as a cool well, and smooth as a whistle. Masculine to the max, and pretty close to being ready to drink. Best to hold until the fall or winter. 12,000 cases made.",Numanthia,93,60,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Numanthia
108125,Spain,"An obscure Catalonian wine made from indigenous grapes, this pricey oddball starts with bubblegum and candy aromas mixed with smoke and meat. The color is dark and the wine is a bit rough. But in a country, unusual way it redeems itself with zippy cherry flavors and a fresh, tight mouthfeel. Best with food.",Gaintus,87,49,Spain Other,Vino de Mesa,NA,Red Blend,Heretat Montrubí
108134,Spain,"Earth, leather and tomato are accents to the dry, lean bouquet. The wine is expectedly juicy and tight, with snappy raspberry and cherry flavors.

108149,Spain,"Dusty and still fairly fresh, but with that said this wine was certainly more in its prime six or eight months ago. Now it is slick but softening, with peach and citrus flavors doing their thing without much edge or kick.",Faustino V Rosado,86,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Faustino
108160,Spain,"For a large-production Rioja, this sings the proper notes and shiould please almost anyone with a taste for Spanish red wines. It's violet in color, indicating good ripeness. The nose is concentrated and likable, with solid berry and plum fruit to back it up. Round, pleasant and with a touch of oaky vanilla on the finish. Drink now.",Crianza,88,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Ramón Bilbao
108364,Spain,"Chardonnay, Muscadet and something known as Pansa Blanca comprise this Catalonian oddball, which is so severely oaked that you have no idea what the grapes might actually taste like. No, it's not badly made, meaning there's mouthfeel, acidity and stages to the wine. But the aromas, flavors and overall package are weird and confusing.",Lanius,82,34,Catalonia,Alella,NA,White Blend,Alta Alella
108369,Spain,"Bee's wax, roast squash and vanilla are the dominant aromas, and all indicate a fading wine that was borderline overripe to begin with.

108376,Spain,"No matter how you slice it, this wine shows a lot of muddled compost on both the nose and palate. It has decent texture and an adequate mouthfeel, but as you chew on the wine you can't escape the cooked, saucy flavors that point to overripeness.",NA,82,9,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo,Oreades
108377,Spain,"A raisiny wine with hot-weather characteristics throughout. The nose is baked and the palate offers mostly prune and burnt oak. There is a limited scope to the mouthfeel, which remains heavy and deep throughout.",NA,82,8,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Garnacha,Lelia
108378,Spain,"From a region where sweet, ripe wines rule, you're not going to get much from this tangy, tart wine dominated by minty aromas and sharp cranberry and raspberry flavors. It's choppy and needling.",Reserva,82,16,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Castillo de Jumilla
108386,Spain,"Baked, stewy and very much in the warm Penedès style. The nose is herbal and green, while tobacco, tomato and other reedy flavors just don't cut it.

108388,Spain,"Cheerful at first, with bubble gum and berry drink mix aromas. The fun pretty much stops there; what follows is astringent berry flavors and a lean, choppy finish. Juicy but lacks sytle and finesse.",Cosecha,82,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Valcortes
108412,Spain,"Dark, rubbery and focused on the nose, while the palate is wider, richer and propped up by a band of zesty acidity.

108414,Spain,"Astrales has really nailed it the past couple of years, and while the '06 isn't quite as good as 2005, it's still an excellent wine.

Drink now and over the next six years.",NA,92,67,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Astrales
108436,Spain,"A lean and peppery style of Rioja that's very much from the old school.

Very young and fresh right now; it improves with patient airing.",Crianza,86,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Salceda
108439,Spain,This Macabeo (Viura) blend is neutral on the nose but fairly big and bulky on the palate. Flavors of lemon-lime and banana are spritzy at first and then stickier late. The rest of the composition (Macabeo and Parellada) dictates that the flavors will be short; but what's on display is nice and creamy.,Proyecto Cu4tro Blanco,86,10,Catalonia,Catalunya,NA,White Blend,Bodegas Concavins
108443,Spain,"A powerful berry-based wine with no oak is what's on offer. The nose exudes rubber and leather at first, and then comes a wave of rambunctious black fruit.

And once again: no oak!",NA,86,10,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Condado de Oriza
108444,Spain,"Persistently murky and leafy on the nose, this traditional-style Rioja brings juicier, brighter fruit to the palate along with some tangy, somewhat sharp acids. In the folds, a dash of oak brings vanilla and additional tannin into the picture. Improves with airing.",Crianza,86,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Loriñon
108462,Spain,"Here's a wine that manages to blend classic notes of dryness, fine acidity and red fruit with modern weight, ripeness, oak and color. It's not otherwordly but it does pass all the tests. The fruit is fine but regular, while the finish hints at licorice and chocolate. A no-frills winner without a lot of fanfare.",Reserva,88,26,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marqués de Murrieta
108465,Spain,"During the harvest last fall winemaker and owner Vicki Pariente said 2007 would be a lean year in Rueda with some great wines. Hers is very pungent and full of nettles, sweat and other cool-climate symptoms. Which doesn't make it a bad wine; just tight, lean and green.

108662,Spain,"Dark in color and seemingly packed on the nose, this wine pulls a no-show on the palate. There's really nothing here but acidity and tart currant and wild raspberry flavors. It only gets more astringent with each sip.",Loma Gorda,81,12,Central Spain,Almansa,NA,Garnacha,Santa Quiteria
108664,Spain,"No way around the fact that this is funky, starchy and full of dry oak and tannins. The nose is rubbery and earthy, while the palate shows some green tobacco and herbal flavors. Gets better with airing, but the pleasure factor remains low.",Gran Reserva,81,19,Levante,Utiel-Requena,NA,Tempranillo,Torre Oria
108676,Spain,"Disappointing considering the price. There's no good reason to pay $40 for a cava that's cidery and offers hints of vinegar along the way.

108680,Spain,"Austere aromas of wintergreen, lemon peel and cola don't allow for much fruit to escape, and the palate is literally as hard as nails.

108723,Spain,"Solid as can be, with sweet-styled aromas of berry syrup and tire rubber. In the mouth, the wine shows juicy cherry and raspberry flavors in front of a lively finish.

108729,Spain,"It's hard to rate an aging, oxidizing, barrel-fermented Verdejo and take into consideration the wine's faded qualities versus its complexities. If you like dried apricots, dehydrated mango slices and fruit jellies, then this will tickle your fancy.

108736,Spain,"This tiny production SB is sweet and easygoing, with canned peach aromas along with pineapple and mild citrus flavors.

Drink right away.",Doña Beatriz,86,12,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Sauvignon,Bodegas Cerrosol
108737,Spain,"Smooth and friendly on the nose, with easy melon and peach aromas that give you confidence in the wine's core character. The palate is nothing special; there's citrus and pineapple before a medium-long finish. Solid but not the most expressive Albariño out there.",Selección,86,25,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Adegas D'Altamira
108741,Spain,"Starts out sharp and funky, and then quickly you realize that it's showing signs of age. The wine blends sweet and sour notes on both the bouquet and palate, issuing primary grapefruit flavors and some mustard greens on the finish. But the feel is chunky and it's losing its zest day by the day.",NA,86,15,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Vega de la Reina
109003,Spain,"The nose is all dense blackberries, while the palate is deep, flashy and ripe, with flavors of black cherry and blackberry. If you like big, bold wines, then this one should strike you in a good way; it's saturated and dark, with a touch of vanilla and mocha on the finish. Great balance for such a big wine. Drink now through 2012.",Élite,91,36,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Muruve
109033,Spain,"A little baked and flat smelling, with licorice and stewed fruit aromas. Sounds kind of dark and heavy, right? But the palate runs to the thin side, with lean but pure raspberry and cherry flavors. Vitality and snap are its virtues; not much depth or character are its fallbacks.",Reserva,86,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marques de Arienzo
109035,Spain,"Magenta-tinted and ready to go; that in a nutshell is this easy, no-oak blend of Tempranillo and Grenache. It's fruity to the max, with aromas of boysenberry and black cherry as well as similar flavors. Ripe and easy to drink.",NA,85,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,El Circulo
109037,Spain,"Dusty and neutral on the nose, with a hint of wild flower and mineral to stir interest. The palate is dry despite having some size and plumpness; flavors of apple, peach and papaya are crisp and lean.",Estate Bottled Dry,85,13,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Muscat,Sumarroca
109040,Spain,"The winery has dialed back the time in oak for its barrel-fermented Viura to two months from five or six, and it's a decidedly less oaky wine than in years prior. Now it shows a controlled lees character along with lemon and apple flavors. Limited in what it offers, but made well.",Blanco Fermentado en Barrica,85,8,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Marqués de Cáceres
109046,Spain,"Oily and pungent, as if the cat were not let out of the house. But airing reveals a wide spectrum of green, yellow and orange fruits and vegetables.

109056,Spain,"Cáceres does basic Viura as well as anyone in Spain.

It's juicy, fresh and amounts to the quintessential summer sipper.",NA,87,8,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Viura,Marqués de Cáceres
109060,Spain,"For inexpensive Albariño, Nessa delivers the goods. The nose is flowery and soft, but most of all it's inviting.

Drink right away.",NA,87,12,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Nessa
109072,Spain,"Cotton candy and warm, dusty aromas give the wine pleasant, semisweet opening aromas.

109301,Spain,"Over a year ago this wine rated only 86, but bottle age has improved it, and now its condensed nose of black fruit and chocolate mint chip is very pleasing.

109321,Spain,"Interesting and unique blends get bonus points, but in the long run this conglomeration of indigenous grapes from Mallorca is a touch too resiny and bland to really deserve a call out.

109324,Spain,"A warm vintage (2006) may be causing this wine to expire prematurely, but tasted in 2008 it seems to be losing its drive.

109350,Spain,"This wine is clearly shooting for the modern style of Rioja; it's dark as night, soft and meaty. But it also has a lot of gaseous sulfur on the nose and hard tannins. Expect a chewy, broad Rioja that's hedonistic but on the cusp of overripe. Decant before drinking within the next two years.",Martin Cendoya Reserva,87,38,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Heredad Ugarte
109357,Spain,"A little rough around the edges, i.e. there's a sharp note to the nose and then lots of barrel char to back that up. There's black fruit, pepper and lots of oak on the palate, which has a full feel and then firm, clamping tannins.",Lanzaga,87,30,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Telmo Rodríguez
109374,Spain,"Watermelon, cantaloupe and peach aromas are just as they should be, while the palate is whole, fresh and full of tangerine and nectarine.

109378,Spain,"Coconut and wintergreen aromas announce new oak, and as it opens this somewhat muscular Rioja unveils butter and charred scents.

Drink now through 2009.",Inspiración Valdemar,87,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Valdemar
109507,Spain,"Another winner from Emilio Moro. The nose is a touch minty and very spicy, but the black fruit element is there and overall the bouquet sings of integration.

109614,Spain,"Full and boisterous red wine, with a ton of natural ripeness and a high pleasure quotient. We have always liked the Abadal wines, and this Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend gets both sides of the Old World/New World argument right. It's loaded with dark berry and earth aromas, which are followed by cola, blackberry and chocolate flavors.

109627,Spain,"White raisin and touches of lettuce and celery give this multigrape blend some richness but also a bit of green character.

109628,Spain,"Matchstick, mushroom and licorice nib aromas add character to this fading but textured wine that struggles to offer peach and nectarine flavors.

109634,Spain,"Dry black cherry and berry fruit shows some early chemical accents, and the wine stays sort of thin and hard all the way to the end. It's peppery and tight, with a simple dark-fruit personality. A little awkward at 14.5%.",Crianza,84,16,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Barzagoso
109805,Spain,"It's not easy to find mature Rioja from a great winery and a great year. This is all that; it smells of tobacco, earth and dried fruits. The palate is lively and not dying, while the flavors of cherry, raisin and marzipan are spot on.

109818,Spain,"Big and sultry as always, with bacon, smoke, black fruit and a full rack of spices making for a wonderful bouquet. Concentrated and ripped for a 2007, with blackberry, clove, pepper, cinnamon and vanilla flavors. And then comes tobacco and more spice on the finish, which is grabby but understandable because it's so young. Best from 2012 through 2019.",Malleolus de Valderramiro,93,176,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto Fino,Emilio Moro
109823,Spain,"Once again this is a stalwart modern-style Rioja with a mix of floral aromas, licorice, blackberry and coconut. The palate is both lively and subtle, and the flavor profile shows an impressive blend of cherry, plum, cream and cocoa, while the finish is long and smooth. A high-quality wine that should impress. Drink now through 2015.",NA,93,62,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,San Vicente
109867,Spain,"Ripe, dark, a little oily and totally compelling from an aromatic standpoint. The palate is right where it should be, as neither the tannins nor the acidity are out of whack. Boysenberry, blackberry and plum flavors carry an herbal touch, and the finish is layered, with a lasting impression of coffee.",Reserva,90,32,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Conde de Siruela
109887,Spain,"Purple in color and meaty on the nose, with a hint of raisin and reduction but not too much. Due to the heat of 2003, this is a ripe, rich wine with big plum and berry flavors but also good balance and feel. It covers all the bases and finishes in a smooth, solid, stylish way. Just reaches the cut of excellence.",Fincas de Ganuza Reserva,90,51,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Remírez de Ganuza
109923,Spain,"A bit too much new American oak was thrown at this crianza, leaving minty, drying aromas that veer into the butter and dill range. The palate is largely fresh and balanced, with peppery red-fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry. A woody encore smothers the finish.",Crianza,84,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,El Circulo
109926,Spain,"Cloudy in color, with tart rhubarb aromas. The palate shows some acidity and tang, with pink grapefruit flavors offering a shrill kick. But overall the wine has seen better days and has become limited in scope at this point.",Rosé,84,11,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,Condesa de Leganza
109927,Spain,"Fiery, hot aromas feature raspberry, burnt leaves, balsamic notes and earth. It's wild and jumpy in the mouth, with rhubarb and cranberry defining the tight, underdeveloped palate, while the finish is tangy and almost peachy. Shows many cool-year characteristics of a 2002.",Reserva,84,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Baron De Ley
109930,Spain,"Fresh peach and nectarine dominate the nose on this semisweet blend of Viura and Malvasia. The flavors are mostly melon and citrus, while the finishing touch is that of fruit cocktail. It's a touch sticky in the long run, but at least it isn't cloying or cooked.",Satinela Medium-Sweet,84,9,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Marqués de Cáceres
109934,Spain,"Aromatic notes of talcum powder and scented candles give this Bordeaux blend from Navarra a light, pleasant bouquet. But the palate is more starching and hard than ideal, leaving a spiky, jagged feel to the wine's raspberry and plum fruit. So rugged and jarring that food is downright mandatory. Ripped but punishing.",Ars Mácula,84,25,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Tandem
109941,Spain,"Rueda is best when it's fresh and dancing, but this 2006 is showing too many signs of the hot year from which it came. It's already tired and soft, with compost and mealy citrus aromas going head to head with grapefruit and marmalade notes. Tasted in December 2007, this was probably a tastier, fresher wine six months prior.",NA,84,16,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Martinsancho
110115,Spain,"A pure and intense rendition of Priorato. The nose is stacked with minerality, smoke, ink and tough but regal black fruit aromas. It's powerful and concentrated in the mouth, with bold cassis and blackberry flavors in front of a long, flavorful, slightly lemony finish. Needs a few years to show its best; drink from 2011 through 2017.",Mas Sinén Coster,92,74,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Celler Burgos-Porta
110116,Spain,"A big-time Priorato with tobacco, minerality and dark fruit aromas in front of a lush and smooth palate full of cola, blackberry and licorice flavors. There's all the power you could ask for but also complexity and layering that set up a minerally finish of mocha and coffee. Drink from 2011 through 2015.",Pissarres,92,34,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Costers del Priorat
110222,Spain,"Take the bubbles out of Cava and this is pretty much what's left. The nose is light, with peach and banana aromas. Tangy flavors of orange and pineapple are lively but lacking, and the finish is ripe but simple. For flush flavors and just enough zap, this is good.",Can Feixes Blanc Selecció,84,13,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,White Blend,Huguet de Can Feixes
110224,Spain,"Oily and citrusy, with pungent, almost nutty aromas that are at once exotic but simultaneously funky and sour. The palate hits with chopping passion fruit and citrus, but there's also some banana to contemplate. In the end, it's just too hard to embrace and go beyond a sip or two, which isn't a great testimonial.",Finca la Colina,84,30,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Sauvignon Blanc,Vinos Sanz
110246,Spain,"Sweet and chunky, like Hawaiian Punch. This is heavy and unctuous at this stage of evolution, with raspberry and ripe melon flavors. Round and no longer edgy. Wait for the 2007.",Rosé,83,9,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Grenache,Marqués de Reala
110249,Spain,"An oaky, awkward, lactic lug that offers a ton of wood grain, funky fruit and a hard, overly spicy mouthfeel. It's trying to do too much with smoke and mirrors; the raw material isn't there.",Cenit,83,47,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Zamora,NA,Tempranillo,Viñas del Cenit
110251,Spain,"There's no shortage of ripe aromas: leather, berries and aged cheese. Yet the palate is quite sharp, with searing acidity sitting on top of red-berry flavors. This wine has unlimited aging potential, but will it ever taste great? That remains to be seen.",Alba de Breton,86,72,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Breton
110252,Spain,"A blend of Tempranillo and Garnacha fruit that leaves a red tint and sweet aromas. The palate has plenty of jump and bounce in its step, while the flavors are both sweet and sour. A little sheer but a good wine with ample character.",Conde de Valdemar Rosado,86,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Rosé,Bodegas Valdemar
110274,Spain,"Leafy and peppery on the nose, with light red-fruit aromas and some citrus peel. It runs more lean and spicy than anything, with hints of tomato leaf, fennel and sausage.",Gran Reserva,86,25,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Castillo Clavijo
110279,Spain,"El Coto has gotten its game in gear in recent years. The brand's value-priced wines like this Viura are clean and proper. In this case, opening aromas of stone and lime yield to green fruits and cucumber. The wine is easy and fresh, with a juicy, simple mouthfeel.",NA,86,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Viura,El Coto
110341,Spain,"Spice, herbs, smoked meat and a dark core work in harmony on the bouquet. The palate on this well-made Reserva packs black cherry, cassis and plum, and that's followed by a stylish, smooth finish that comes on buttery at first and then settles in. Doesn't overwhelm but complements food nicely. Tasted twice.",Reserva,90,40,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Conde de la Salceda
110342,Spain,"Very colorful and properly ripe, with lush berry aromas backed by coffee notes. The palate is lush and balanced, with deep blueberry, black cherry and cola notes. A truly committed wine with a smooth, unctuous finish as the final chapter.",NA,90,15,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Syrah,Alceño
110350,Spain,"Starts with roasted, leathery aromas that feature hints of burnt beef and berry compote. The palate is layered and nicely balanced, with berry flavors hitting first and chocolate coming next. Espresso is the final act, as it ties the mouth to the finish in impressive fashion. A big load but one that's still manageable.",Tinto Roble,90,20,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Rejadorada
110417,Spain,"Really nice and lush, with an aromatic mix of tobacco, baked fruit, mocha, vanilla, shoe polish, earth and more. It displays a ripe, friendly feel and yummy flavors of mocha, chocolate and savory, subtle berry fruits. Layered on the finish, with lasting notes of fig, mocha and blackberry. Drink now through 2012.",Expression,92,59,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Alidis
110520,Spain,"Quite brambly and funky, with a roasted “country” quality that points it toward leather and rubber. An organic wine with 80% Tempranillo and 20% Garnacha; it's sort of tangy and choppy on the palate, with a mix of awkwardly sweet and sour flavors.",Organic,83,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Greener Planet
110526,Spain,"Concentrated aromas of mocha, toffee and burnt coffee bound from the glass, followed by flavors of sour red cherry and berry. Sound balance and soft, dusty tannins make this wine easily enjoyable and easy to drink.",Alate Kosher,83,15,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo,J. Fernández de Arcaya Galdiano
110534,Spain,"So young and simple that one can only describe this as Albariño Nouveau. It's a bouncy, almost spritzy confection with pineapple, green apple and other thin citrus flavors. There's zero body to it, but it is fresh and snappy.",NA,83,28,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Mar de Frades
110554,Spain,"Not an expressive Rueda but it sizzles. Despite being young and driving, it's more neutral in flavor and texture than the winery's Verdejo, which is excellent. This wine shows all citrus with light green accents, and with shrimp or Asian foods it'll do well.",NA,86,10,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,White Blend,Valdelainos
110564,Spain,"This semisweet blend of Malvasia and Viura is not everyday stuff, but if you have a taste for something sweet and different, give it a try. The nose is floral and waxy, while flavors of honey and ultraripe pineapple are heady and sugary. Not a drop-dead winner but unique and interesting.",Diamante Semi-Sweet Malvasia-Viura,86,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Bodegas Franco-Españolas
110573,Spain,"Almond, sherry and banana aromas start it out. The palate is mellow and smooth, with apple and touches of lemon. There's ring and some zing on the finish, but not too much as the wine is beginning to show signs of reaching early maturity. Drink immediately.",Pazo Barrantes,86,23,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Pazo de Barrantes
110578,Spain,"Tan in color, with short flashes of apple and spice on the bouquet. The palate has a small level of oxidation, while the mouthfeel benefits from smooth but present acidity. Limited in scope and flavor, but solid for a wine that's beginning to fade.",Gran Vinum,85,24,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Adegas Gran Vinum
110610,Spain,"Very nice from head to toe. The nose breathes leather, tobacco, berry fruit and spice, while the palate offers evolved, top-tier plum and cherry flavors. Exotic and concentrated, with hints of licorice. Pretty big and rich, but also quite well made.",Selección Crianza,90,18,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Alceño
110617,Spain,"Exemplary Ribera del Duero, given that '02 was not a great year. This wine, however, pours on the richness fans of this region are looking for. The palate is lush and ripe, with deep plum and blackberry flavors supported by mocha and earth shadings. Offers a little bit of everything.",Crianza,90,38,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Convento San Francisco
110628,Spain,"This producer is doing a very good job with its superaffordable, no-dosage cava. The nose is lightly floral, with the accent on apple blossom. The palate is solid and crisp, with appropriate white-fruit flavors. Crisp on the finish, with a lively feel. A pleasurable sipper for sure.",Brut Zero Reserva,89,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Castellblanch
110632,Spain,"A gem in the semisweet category, with touches of melon and banana on the nose. The palate pours on the sweet apple cider and warm citrus, while the finish is on the mark. This is a generous, no-brainer of a bubbly: Just uncork, pour, sip and smile.",Extra Dry,89,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
110634,Spain,"Purple in color, with a sweet, fragrant bouquet featuring mostly plum and strawberry but also a touch of rusticity. Bold and full of cherry-cola flavors, while the feel is downright plush and proper. A very nice (and new to the market) wine from Torres; and there's no knocking its value qualifications.",Malena,89,10,Catalonia,Catalunya,NA,Garnacha,Torres
110700,Spain,"Staunch red fruit aromas are a bit prickly at first, but within a few minutes they settle on mineral, herbs, anise and licorice. The palate has a firm but pure feel, and the tannins aren't too tough at all. Flavors of cassis, cherry cough drop and raisin are deep yet narrow, and just complex enough. Drink now through 2013.",Clos de l'Obac,92,87,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Costers del Siurana
110701,Spain,"Another great Tempranillo from Sierra Cantabria? Indeed it is. The nose bleeds cedary, sweet black fruit aromas and coconut, while the palate is pure and layered, with a lush feel and rich flavors of black fruits and chocolate. Long and lasting on the finish, and delicious overall. Approachable now but ageable for at least five years.",Cuvée,92,29,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
110711,Spain,"Thoroughly modern in style, with an oaky nose of campfire, spice, vanilla, sawdust and molten berry. The palate is solid and shows good vital acidity, while the flavors of blackberry are meaty and thorough, with hints of coconut, chocolate and cream. Seems a little more balanced and interesting than FB's richer, softer Selección.",NA,91,45,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Ferrer Bobet
110721,Spain,"Concentrated and sweet, with a baked, raisiny richness that maintains its clarity. The palate is dense but not punishing or tannic. Flavors of blackberry and prune veer toward syrupy, setting up a sweet, generous finish of fig paste and coconut. Modern-styled Rioja done right.",Seleccion Personal,91,55,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Abel Mendoza
110725,Spain,"A complete modern Rioja with cola, cassis and smoky aromas. Excellent mouthfeel and toasty black fruit and licorice flavors work well together, and the finish is refined, warm and peppery. Not an overly lush wine but it is generous and loaded with a bit of everything good: body, tannin, acidity, flavor and complexity. Drink now through 2014.",Reserva,91,27,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Muga
110789,Spain,"With pretty flower blossom aromas mixed with lemon verbena, the nose on this Albariño is very nice. There's body and weight, but balance, too. Melon, citrus and mineral flavors are clean and satisfying, and the acidity is bright and entirely food-ready.",NA,89,15,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Condes de Albarei
110823,Spain,"Sassy pepper and light rhubarb aromas give this medium-weight crianza a spicy, lean outlook. The palate has tang, vibrant red fruit and mildly grating acidity, while the finish runs zesty and rings about your mouth as it does a spicy fade. A wine for current consumption.",Crianza,85,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Campo Viejo
110824,Spain,"Light berry and sugar cookie aromas kick it off, followed by peach pit and nectarine flavors. For a wine that's basic in composition and a little dilute, it's also fresh and held together by good acidity. Straightforward but solid.",Reinares,85,8,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Rosé,Bodegas Eguren
110825,Spain,"Clean, fresh and simple. Gran Feudo will neither thrill nor disappoint as it delivers adequate citrus, raspberry and rhubarb flavors propelled by choppy, stinging acids. It shows a good attack before breaking up on the finish. A can't-fail rosé for the summer and fall of 2008.",Gran Feudo,85,12,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Rosé,Bodegas Julián Chivite
110870,Spain,"Waxy and burning on the nose, and then very heavy and sugary on the palate. The orange marmalade and honey flavors are over the top and sticky, while the wine leaves an unctuous, resinous finish. Too much of this 15% Moscatel could cause a headache.",Vino Dulce Natural,82,18,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Moscatel,Señorío de Sarria
110877,Spain,"With 20% Garnacha, this Navarran Merlot carries a green and lactic streak that makes it a tough go. The palate is gigantic and oversaturated, which makes the whole clumsy and rough.",Palacio de Eza,82,12,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Merlot,Tandem
110912,Spain,"This is the type of wine that's giving resurgent Jumilla a positive reputation. The nose is smoky but still loaded with solid fruit, while the palate bubbles over with pure blackberry and plum. It's a Monastrell-dominated blend, but it tastes a lot like Tempranillo, which is only 15% of the blend. Very nice overall.",Selección Roble,89,13,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Alceño
110933,Spain,"A classic cava from top to bottom. The nose offers familiar baked apple, mineral and saline aromas, while the palate is exceedingly fresh in its delivery of pineapple, apple and nectarine flavors. A fruity yet crisp number that foams up nicely on the palate but doesn't lose its focus or form.",Aria Estate Brut,89,12,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
110935,Spain,"Black fruit, licorice and earth are all aromas of classic Montsant, and together they are easy to enjoy and understand. Ripe black cherry, pepper and an undercurrent of licorice and coffee work the palate, while the finish sports tight acids and smooth tannins. Good now through 2009.",NA,89,35,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Red Blend,Mas Franch
110937,Spain,"A touch heavy, but not nearly as weighty and syrupy as this winery's '03 Excelencia. At 14%, it's a bit raisiny and blustery, but the dark plum and coffee flavors do manage to please. And the finish is full of chocolate and fudge-like residue. Big but fun; ready to be drunk now.",El Albar,88,20,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,J. & F. Lurton
110938,Spain,"Keeps the Cordon Negro reputation healthy by delivering easygoing lemon-lime aromas and round citrus and apple flavors. As correct as one can ask for, this large-production cava features pure-fruit character and a perfectly good mouthfeel. For the money, we give it the proverbial high-five.",Cordon Negro Brut,88,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
111000,Spain,"Somontano is not exactly prime real estate among Spanish wine regions, but Blecua, a four-grape blend led by Cabernet Sauvignon, is one of the best wines the region has to offer. Smoke, licorice, rooty cola and lemony oak aromas mix with flavors of blackberry, coffee, cola and roasted meats. It's a bit choppy and hard now, but time will help it along. A classy wine to drink from 2011 through 2016.",Blecua,91,100,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Red Blend,Viñas del Vero
111006,Spain,"A rewarding wine that isn't overly pricey or difficult to enjoy. Dark, lightly baked aromas hint at raisin and marshmallow, while the palate has a deep texture and vital acidity. Savory, tea-infused flavors bring pulse and kick, and as a whole it delivers a true reflection of what Ribera del Duero should be.",Damana Crianza,91,21,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas y Viñedos Tábula
111008,Spain,"Earth, rubber, spice, oak and bold berry aromas give this a classic Ribera nose, while the palate is pure and sensual, with shining raspberry, strawberry and plum flavors. Control and poise are on display, and the finish is clean, dry, warm and satisfying. Will be better in two or three years; best from 2012 through 2018.",Malleolus,91,71,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto Fino,Emilio Moro
111041,Spain,"This blend of Tempranillo, Merlot, Cabernet and Graciano has a sultry, earthy, almost minerally nose that's backed up by blackberry, cassis and melted brown sugar flavors. Chewy and modern, with a brawny finish that houses baked-fruit notes and a dash of chocolate.",NA,89,45,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Red Blend,Señorío de Andión
111049,Spain,"A big, ripe and earthy wine, with some baked black fruit and chocolate to the nose. Far more saturated and dense than Siruela's other Ribera wines, but amid the heft there's rich plum and roasted berry flavors and good overall balance. The finish has an herbal tinge.",Élite,89,48,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Conde de Siruela
111050,Spain,"A mixture of baked fruit, bacon, asphalt and leather aromas is impressive, and so is the bright, composed palate and its flavors of plum, raspberry and tobacco. It's crisp and zesty, which is probably reflective of the cool 2002 vintage, but still it's a very nice wine with depth and dexterity. Drink now.",Vendimia Seleccionada,89,48,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Luis Alegre
111063,Spain,"Raw and resiny, with no peg for you to hang your hat on. The palate is sharp and short on ripeness, while the finish settles on hot. Just an aggressive wine with little polish. Not worth the price.",Javier Asensio,82,29,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Merlot,Asensio
111077,Spain,"Green, lemony and murky on the nose, this young wine shows that a good vintage in a renowned region doesn't always amount to a good wine. This is a funky, earthy specimen with burnt notes and a grassy aftertaste.",Vall Sanzo,81,13,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Valsanzo
111078,Spain,"Tired and waxy, with canned fruit aromas and almost no measurable freshness. Tastes both sweet and vegetal. May have been better upon release but now it's flat.",NA,81,14,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Lícia
111085,Spain,"Dry, dull papaya and apricot aromas surely don't overwhelm, but they don't foretell the complete lack of fruit on the palate. A faded, insipid white wine. It has no pulse and tastes mealy.",NA,80,19,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Eleusis
111118,Spain,"A forward specimen with lots of oak that settles on cinnamon and wood tannin. Also a touch leafy on the nose, and that's backed by tangy cranberry and acid-driven cherry flavors. Very tight and piercing, which for a 2005 crianza is asking too much.",Crianza,85,30,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Hemar
111119,Spain,"A crisp, clean, no-frills white wine that pushes citrus more than heft. Mineral and lime aromas set up zesty citrus flavors, and overall it's a scouring but steady rendition that'll do best when served well chilled.",Solaz Blanco,85,9,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Viura,Osborne
111151,Spain,"Slightly sweet on the nose, the aromas of baked fruit, cream soda and vanilla are welcoming. Interestingly, the wine is a bit more tart and refined on the palate, where zesty but full apple and pear flavors run the show. Not lean but definitely streamlined and acidic. More of a food wine than a stand-alone sipper.",Brut Reserva,88,14,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
111168,Spain,"Fairly agile, floral and friendly, with precise peach, nectarine and citrus flavors. With its easy personality and good mouthfeel, this is what you're looking for in a solid, everyday white wine.",NA,88,16,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Essencia Vendima
111173,Spain,"Shows good fruit aromas, moderate depth and a touch of sandalwood on the nose. The palate features ripe blackberry and chocolate, while the feel is cushioned and chewy. Modern in style; just a cut below the 2001.",Reserve,88,44,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Callejo
111178,Spain,"This rendition of Segura Viudas's off-dry bubbly is nice and yeasty, with plenty of baked apple pie and buttered toast on the nose. The palate is spunky but round, with semi-sweet flavors of apples and ripe nectarines. Shows some complexity and depth on the finish as well as a richness that makes it to all corners of your mouth.",Aria Extra Dry,88,12,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
111270,Spain,"A lot of dill and coconut on the nose, and that dill character remains on the palate and finish. Aside from that, the red-fruit character is zesty and true, while the spice element works well. Imported by Vinamericas Selections.",Selección Especial,84,35,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Urbina
111272,Spain,"Typically dry and earthy, with aromas of wet leaves, rubber and cherry drink mix. The palate features tart red fruit floating on a wave of aggressive acids. Some spice on the finish is a decent second act. Imported by 57 Main Street Wine Co.",Gran Reserva,84,50,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Vizconde de Ayala
111278,Spain,"A touch chalky, but for the most part it's clean and dry. A bit of roasted corn and baked apple along with lower acidity make it a soft, drink-now kind of wine. Plump and peppery, with some pith and bitterness late. Imported by 57 Main Street Wine Co.",Joven Blanco,84,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Viura,Aradon
111289,Spain,"Adequately smoky and raw, with rubber, cassis and black cherry. A bit unfocused and clumsy, but good in a natural, no-frills kind of way. Finishes easy, with oak and some earthy mushroom. Imported by Quality Wines of Spain.",NA,84,11,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Montalvo Wilmot
111291,Spain,"Initial aromas of tree bark, root beer and leather give way to stronger, obvious oak notes. Very snappy on the palate; in fact, it's downright sharp and acidic in the midpalate. Has its positives but is too racy and shrill in the middle. Imported by Haro Imports.",Crianza,84,34,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Castillo de Urtau
111294,Spain,"Sweet and syrupy, but also murky, with aromas of wet dog and moist leaves. Rich on the palate, with thick, stewy flavors of prune and carob. Warm and chocolaty on the finish, but still sort of ponderous and clumsy. Imported by Jorge Ordoñez/Fine Estates from Spain.",Codice,84,9,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Dominio de Eguren
111311,Spain,"Dark and crusty aromas of black fruit, wild black truffles, coconut and lemon peel are pure Priorato, while the tight, tannic palate provokes salivation as it delivers firm black cherry, dark plum and citrusy (lemon) flavors. Finishes with coffee and coconut. The definition of a harmonious Priorat red. Drink from 2011 through 2016.",Mas Sinén Negre,91,62,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Celler Burgos-Porta
111312,Spain,"Impressive for the way it blends modern richness with authentic aromas and flavors.

Lively and dense, but not heavy. Drink now through 2013.",NA,91,30,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Comenge
111331,Spain,"The aromas are powerful and just the slightest bit brambly. A little hot and rugged on the palate, but loaded with prime black fruit, pepper and mocha notes. It's a potent wine with meaty blackness and plenty of raw power. With 65,000 cases produced, it's not a “boutique” wine, as evidenced by the friendly price tag.",Crianza,89,16,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Muruve
111428,Spain,"The aromas are sweet, while the palate is light and graced by easygoing cherry and raspberry flavors. A little bit pointed and sharp in feel, but good in a citrusy sort of way.",Esencia Valdemar Rosé,85,8,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Garnacha,Bodegas Valdemar
111451,Spain,"Patience is a must to make it through this burly, earthy, almost murky blend of Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon. Early aromas of mulch and coffee morph into black fruit and leather, while initially reduced black cherry and currant flavors take on more character and depth with time. Never does it really shine, but it is a serious wine that has its merits.",Cuvée Palomar,88,48,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Abadia Retuerta
111453,Spain,"One of my personal favorites among the giant collection of Freixenet cavas is the extra dry, which isn't dry in the least. Just the opposite, it's loaded with sweet apple and apricot aromas along with peach, melon and candied citrus flavors. Best of all, it maintains its poise while never falling toward cloying or sappy.",Cordon Negro Extra Dry,88,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
111457,Spain,"Robust and dark, with plum and berry aromas that also carry hints of citrus and mineral. Overall this is a balanced specimen; the palate is round and full of bright plum and berry while the feel is moderately deep, somewhat tannic, and medium in acidity. Drink now.",Crianza,88,17,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,Valdrinal
111462,Spain,"A bit lighter on the nose than many, with notes of raspberry and strawberry. That same character works its way onto the palate, where raspberry and plum flavors are front and center. Fruity and balanced, with a ripe, easy-to-like personality.",NA,88,17,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Mas Dels Frares
111463,Spain,"Hard spices, smoke and tar darken up the berry nose, while the palate is round and solid, with nice berry and plum fruit. The finish delivers a wave of blackened toast, while licorice plays from the second chair. Nicely made and familiar as RDD goes.",Reserva,88,40,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,Matarromera
111468,Spain,"Dark in color, with brawny aromas of oak, clove and leather. In the mouth, there's a mix of black plum and cherry but also a streak of bell pepper. Finishes round, spicy, properly tannic and dark, with coffee and a light hint of green.",Viña Lanciano Reserva,87,25,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas LAN
111470,Spain,"Bulky and a bit stewy, but still balanced enough to earn its positive points. The palate is ripe and sweet, as it oozes with black fruit. Some might call it a touch chunky, but for the most part this blend of Monastrell, Tempranillo and Syrah registers as a highly pleasurable red.",Tinto,87,10,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Alceño
111473,Spain,"Sweet and spicy stuff, with plenty of oak-based coconut and butter on the nose. In the mouth, it's quite saturated and flush, with overt plum, blackberry and wood resin notes. A big, modern wine that's a bit oafish but also rather easy to drink.",Agnus Crianza,87,25,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Valdelana
111573,Spain,"Light and generally unexpressive, with peach and melon aromas. Basic honeydew and nectarine flavors lead to a waxy, grippy palate that carries some pineapple and banana flavors. Sweet but not overly. Imported by Haro Imports.",Semi-Sweet,84,11,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,White Blend,Maset del Lleó
111579,Spain,"The nose of this Bobal-based red displays soft, candied fruit aromas and something akin to citrus. Light plum and peach flavors carry the short, simple palate. Tastes pretty good but lacks depth and stuffing. Imported by Tasman Imports, Ltd.",Tinto,84,6,Levante,Valencia,NA,Bobal,Bodegas Murviedro
111595,Spain,"Smoke and rubber aromas along with soy carry the nose. Raspberry and spice, mainly clove, kick in on the palate. Finishes sharp and juicy, with a lot of acidity. Also plenty of drawn out, unflinching wood. Imported by Metrowine Distribution.",NA,84,10,Catalonia,Catalunya,NA,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Catalino
111596,Spain,"Heavily oaked, with aromas of coconut, rubber and fruitcake. Bold tannins warm the palate, which dishes out cherry, currant and plum flavors. A bit too stewy on the whole, but with merits between the cracks. Imported by Quality Wines of Spain.",NA,84,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Capitoso
111600,Spain,"Deep and dark on the nose, with licorice, cola and prune aromas. The palate is chunky and full, albeit a touch soft. Saturated flavors of cola, blackberry and chocolate define it as a rich, modern wine, and the finish is appropriately creamy and stacked with sweetness and depth. A lush blend of Garnacha, Cabernet and two indigenous varieties. Drink now through 2011.",Negre,90,20,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Red Blend,Jaspi
111602,Spain,"Opens with earth, tobacco, briar and nutty aromas. This is now aged to its best state, and while there's still some tannic bite, it's at a straightforward, mature place. Flavors of roasted plum and spice are classy, and the finish is reflective of a fine vintage. Drink now or in the near future.",Glorioso Gran Reserva,90,35,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Palacio
111623,Spain,"Dark and dense, with aromas of rich black fruits, grilled meat and a lot of oak. The palate is extracted but it's not the least bit hard or biting. Flavors of Concord grapes and blackberry are sweet, and the finish keeps its fruit. Could it use more minerality and toughness? Maybe, but as is it's very approachable. Drink now through 2012.",Selecció Especial,90,95,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Ferrer Bobet
111630,Spain,"Violet and blackberry aromas are an inviting first act, while the palate is lush and fairly deep, with thick blackberry and mildly brambly flavors. Maybe it doesn't reach the penthouse, but as Ribera del Duero goes it more than makes the grade. 45,000 cases made.",Crianza,88,22,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Conde de Siruela
111632,Spain,"Dark plum aromas are sweetened and softened by oak-based coconut aromas, while the color and weight are deeper and darker than average. The palate is full, ripe, semicushioned but also acidic and vital, with black fruit, mocha and coffee notes. It finishes chocolaty, with a slight herbal note.",Finca Monasterio,88,55,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Baron De Ley
111638,Spain,"Not much different than the basic Sarria rosado, with maybe a touch more concentration and richness. The nose is a bit dusty, with good berry fruit notes and a whiff of cherry blossom. The palate is wet and fresh, with raspberry and plum-skin flavors. Crisp and refreshing.",Viñedo N° 5 Rosé,88,14,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Garnacha,Señorío de Sarria
111721,Spain,"A little bit off balance, with mild compost and earth on the nose giving way to an angular palate with pointed acids along with flavors of zesty berries and red apple skins.",Crianza,84,21,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Dios Ares
111752,Spain,"Pinot Noir-based cavas are touchy; sometimes they take on a rough, peppery personality that some might find offputting. This wine does that, but only to an extent. The nose pushes peach pit and campfire aromas, while the palate features dry fruits like papaya and melon, but with cinnamon and pepper shadings. Good mouthfeel and well made, but the flavors and aromas require some getting used to.",Brut,87,14,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Pinot Noir,Codorníu
111753,Spain,"Brick colored, with a baked, spicy nose that is true Rioja in that it also pushes Sherry, raisin and cinnamon notes. Fairly dry, acidic and zesty in the mouth, with cherry and cola flavors. Forceful acidity keeps it moving along. Needs food to absorb that acid.",Reserva,87,18,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Castillo Labastida
111762,Spain,"Generally speaking, this wine is nicely balanced and a bit less over the top than most 2003s. The nose shows mint, fresh herbs, graphite and berry aromas. The palate is juicy, not dull or heavy, with black cherry and dark plum flavors. Finishes almost crisp, with a shot of balancing acidity.",NA,87,17,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tempranillo,Tres Lunas
111766,Spain,"Deep in color, falling somewhere between copper and red. The nose is forward as could be, with raspberry and a strong hint of orange blossom. Solid across the palate, with dry berry flavors and a powerful edge of pepper. Based on Pinot Noir; you can taste the essence of that variety at its core.",Aria Brut Rosé,87,12,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Pinot Noir,Segura Viudas
111767,Spain,"With its citrusy nose and well-balanced palate, this is what Best Buy sparklers are all about. Tangerine and orange peel grace the bouquet, while crisp flavors of berries and stone fruits win you over. A bit of strawberry and snap close the deal. Nice stuff.",Brut Rosé,87,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
111845,Spain,"Begins with cola and root beer aromas before going decidedly stewy. Ultra lemony on the palate, a combination of thin but cooked fruit along with overaggressive oak. Finishes reedy, with tomato notes. A wine with greater intentions that doesn't click. Imported by Frederick Wildman and Sons, Ltd.",Finca Monasterio,83,45,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Baron De Ley
111846,Spain,"Sharp and green at first, with cranberry and herbal aromas. Ultrafirm and smoky on the palate, with a hard-cooked flavor profile. Decent tannins and structure, but short on friendliness and depth. Typical base-level Bobal. Imported by Tasman Imports, Ltd.",Tinto,83,10,Levante,Valencia,NA,Red Blend,Los Monteros
111847,Spain,"Sharp, with harsh, reduced aromas of tar, rhubarb and molasses. A lot of heavy plum and berry flavors raise hopes, but in the end it's just not that thrilling. Authentic, however. Imported by Table 31 Imports.",Joven,83,8,Northern Spain,Cigales,NA,Tempranillo,Val de Los Frailes
111848,Spain,"Intriguing earthy, leafy aromas as well as a lot of roasted meat and berry fruit to the nose. Any high expectations, however, are lost on the palate, where it's sour and scouring. Yes, there's red cherry and rhubarb for the tart-fruit lovers, but the bet here is that most will find it starched out and not that pleasant to drink. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",Viña Real Gran Reserva,83,48,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,CVNE
111853,Spain,"Flat and heavy, with pasty aromas. The palate deals bulky plum flavors, which are followed by black cherry and kirsch. Almost a red wine in its color and weight. Imported by The Marchetti Co.",Rosado,83,6,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Coto de Hayas
111857,Spain,"Out of the ordinary, so it's hard to gauge. To enjoy this you have to appreciate the off-dry style that features residual sugar and overt sweetness. In that sense, it's a lot like White Zin. Assuming that's not your bag, it won't score big. Imported by Haro Imports.",Semi-Dulce,83,11,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Rosé,Maset del Lleó
111863,Spain,"Simple and fruity, with red-cherry and candied aromas. The palate offers pie cherry and raspberry with a streak of acidity running through the center. Finishes light and zesty. Not much to it, but not bad. Imported by Tasman Imports, Ltd.",Tinto,83,6,Levante,Valencia,NA,Bobal,El Copero
111865,Spain,"Stewy, with aromas of baked beans and cooked fruit. A bit more secure and balanced in the mouth, where plum, cherry and earth notes are heavy but inoffensive. Strives for better balance without really finding it. Imported by Quality Wines of Spain.",Roble,83,19,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Gondomar Del Reino
111866,Spain,"The bouquet begins with uncanny aromas of Italian bitters before turning fat and sweet. The palate is thin and stretched out, with flavors of strawberry and citrus zest. Sort of spicy but more stripped down and dull than exciting. Imported by Baron Francois Collection.",Múrice Crianza,83,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Ijalba
111867,Spain,"Moderate cinnamon spice notes to the nose, with thick, soft apple flavors on the palate. Not the most forward wine, with a leaden mouthfeel. Fails to improve in the glass. Imported by Table 31 Imports.",NA,83,11,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Aldor
111868,Spain,"Rosy in color, with simple jammy aromas. Basic strawberry and black cherry flavors are backed by rubbery tannins. Seems cleanly made; just not all that exciting. Imported by Haro Imports.",NA,83,6,Central Spain,Ribera del Guadiana,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Canchal
111869,Spain,"Aromas of warm cedar planks, tobacco and mushroom turn more murky and leafy with air. Quite acidic, which is why the wine is still kicking and screaming.

Deutsch & Sons.",130 Edicion Limitada Gran Reserva,83,50,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Montecillo
111905,Spain,"The label says it: fermented in barrel. And one sniff delivers the buttery, toasted character of a Burgundy or California Chardonnay. Underneath the oak, there's fine acidity and blazing apple fruit, and once it finishes you get a finely baked aftertaste. An interesting, elevated mix of Treixadura, Godello, Loureira and Albariño.",Fermentado en Barrica,90,20,Galicia,Ribeiro,NA,White Blend,Viña Mein
111922,Spain,"The opening of peach, mineral, honey and wild green herbs is alluring, and the palate runs smooth and full, and also a little soft and mature. Banana, papaya and melon flavors are pretty and the finish holds its stature. Not as minerally and tight as some; this wine has sweetness and depth. Drink soon.",NA,90,18,Northern Spain,Valdeorras,NA,Godello,Gaba do Xil
111929,Spain,"A treasure at this price. The nose is impeccably clean, with tropical fruit and honeyed melon aromas. Elegant in the mouth yet there's also just the right acidic pop to liven up the melon, kiwi and apple flavors. A pure, fruity ride. Treixadura, Torrontées, Loureira and Albariño comprise the blend.",NA,90,14,Galicia,Ribeiro,NA,White Blend,Viña Costeira
111933,Spain,"Admittedly we are tasting this later than we'd prefer, but for an '07 it is still showing vital signs and attractive aromas of sugared pastry, candied apple and lemon-lime. The palate is mostly fresh, though not as lively as it probably was nine months ago, while the flavors of 7Up and peach are refreshing. Drink immediately or wait until the 2008 arrives.",Dona Rosa,88,25,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Adega Martínez Serantes
111958,Spain,"The “value” label from Condes de Albarei is always a good bet. Oceanic aromas and a spritz of lime make the nose just right, and the lively palate of lemon, melon and banana is charged up. Tight on the finish, with citrus and almond skins, and then a lasting impression of pineapple. Young and raring to go.",Salneval,88,10,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Condes de Albarei
112021,Spain,Opens with candied berry and salinic aromas. It's tough in its youth and also a little too funky to inspire much confidence for the future. Toughness in tannins; toughness in fruit; quite peppery on the finish. It just isn't that inviting.,Barrica,84,18,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Martín Berdugo
112024,Spain,"Light on the nose, with nondistinct but fairly fresh fruit aromas. The palate is tangy and shows a combo of red apple and citrus flavors. Finishes with pink grapefruit pith and cleansing acids.",NA,84,9,Catalonia,Tarragona,NA,Rosé,Nostrada
112056,Spain,"With some toast and popcorn to fatten up the standard apple aromas, this is a fairly rich cava, especially given the price. Apple, pear and cinnamon flavors grace the palate, while the finish is persistent beyond expectations. Not overly bubbly but still lively. Strides better than your average quaffer.",Original Brut,87,9,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Codorníu
112057,Spain,"As under-$10 sparklers go, you'd be hard-pressed to find better than this medium-bodied and toasty version from Catalonia's White Castle. The nose is mildly yeasty but basic, while the palate deals juicy apple and white-grape flavors propelled by fresh acidity. Virtuous yet basic. But who's complaining?",Extra Brut,87,8,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Castellblanch
112070,Spain,"A little bit sweet and doughy, but hardly offputting. Deep flavors of cherry, raspberry and strawberry control the palate, while the finish is chocolaty and long. This is one easy-to-like red; it's not complex but it scores plenty of simple pleasure points.",NA,87,9,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Santonegro
112076,Spain,"Sweet and fresh smelling, with aromas of lime, pear and peach. The palate is all about citrus, with some spice and mineral thrown in for good measure. Balanced and zesty, like Albariño should be.",NA,87,15,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Mar de Frades
112079,Spain,"Consistency at a good price is what this textbook cava is all about. The bouquet offers your basic fruit-cocktail aromas, while the palate is sort of plump as it pours on the nectarine and ripe peach flavors. Easygoing, with some weight and roundness.",Carta Nevada Brut,87,9,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
112085,Spain,"Dry berry aromas and a rubbery, saucy quality lead to gritty cherry and raspberry flavors. Very thin and starching, with potent tannins and astringent acids. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",Viña Real Plata Crianza,82,19,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,CVNE
112097,Spain,"This wine proves that “organic” doesn't automatically translate into great. The nose is leathery and sweet, with red licorice and peanut aromas. Sweet and sugary on the palate, with flavors of beets and fruit roll-up. Hard and reduced on the finish. Imported by Quality Wines of Spain.",NA,81,25,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Tornasol
112100,Spain,"A heavy, awkward, rather tasteless blend of Viura and Malvasia. And it's barrel fermented from a hot year. So just imagine the weight. The opposite of a refreshing Spanish white, this is an oily wine with distant notes of dried apricot and vanilla. Imported by Vineyard Brands.",Antea,81,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Marqués de Cáceres
112101,Spain,"Leafy and lean, and muddy. The palate is fiery and generic, with sour flavors of red plum and cherry. Table wine on its best day. Imported by Winery Exchange.",NA,81,11,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Flourish
112103,Spain,"Thin, with flavors of cherry skins and lemon juice. Not nearly enough flesh to support the acidity. Imported by 57 Main Street Wine Co.",Crianza,81,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Vizconde de Ayala

112105,Spain,"This medium-sweet wine has a lot of issues. First off, it smells like cooked bananas. Next, the palate is like mango cotton candy. Third, the juice itself will take a coat of enamel off your teeth. Need more? Imported by Vineyard Brands.",Satinela- Medium Sweet,80,8,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Marqués de Cáceres

112200,Spain,"A little more herbal, stalky and tomato-influenced than the riper, fresher 2005, but still an elegant, complex wine that shines a positive light on this little-known region at the base of the Pyrenees. Tobacco, tomato leaf, root beer and bouillon flavors set up an herbal, almost Bordeaux-like finish. Layered and structured to boot. Drink now through 2012.",Blecua,90,100,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Red Blend,Viñas del Vero
112210,Spain,"Full and dark, with aromas of bacon, crusty minerality, black fruits and spice. Balanced yet bullish, with integrated tannins and toasty, coffee-infused flavors that go straight to black. Long and showing additional coffee on the finish. Drinkable now.",Crianza,90,30,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Felix Callejo
112221,Spain,"Aromas of leather, smoked meats, charred oak and lacquer are not for the weak, while the mouthfeel is firm, deep and just right. Juicy and bright in terms of flavors, with black cherry, vanilla and coconut. Toasty and alert on the finish, but with smacking tannins. Drinkable now and good for another four or five years.",Reserva,90,19,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Beronia
112326,Spain,"If you catch this wine young and properly chilled, it isn't that bad. It's very sweet and sugary, with candied melon, mango and citrus flavors. Then it gets more tropical on the finish, with ending notes of banana and mango. On the verge of tasting fake but not quite.",Satinela Medium-Sweet,84,9,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Marqués de Cáceres
112333,Spain,"Hot and earthy, with herbal aromas sitting in front of a hard, grabby palate. The flavors show more plum skin and sourness than sweet, ripe juice. Hence the wine is narrow and fairly astringent. On the plus side, it seems natural and typical for what Cariñena produces.",No. IV,83,22,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Red Blend,Gabarda
112334,Spain,"Despite a fairly positive bouquet, the mouthfeel is tight and the flavor profile is narrow. Sheer across the palate with hard cherry and mild citrus flavors. There's no shortage of tannin either on this young red.",No. II,83,14,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Red Blend,Gabarda
112355,Spain,"Red fruit is the focus of this zesty, rugged Tempranillo-based wine. The palate is lively and acidic, as plum and berry flavors get lots of boost. The finish is firm and medium in depth, with a stout amount of tannin. Drink now, preferably with food.",Gran Feudo Reserva,87,15,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Julián Chivite
112356,Spain,"Hay, corn and buttered toast are the initial aromas, and soon after the wine settles into a pretty good groove. The palate is pure and sweet, with sticky, ripe fruit flavors that veer toward fruit cocktail and mango but never turn cloying. This wine handles its sugar like a pro.",Semi-Seco,87,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Castellblanch
112360,Spain,"A wave of pleasant but light cherry, blackberry and sage offers a powerful but not overpowering opening. The palate is juicy and fresh, with controlled cherry and a touch of buttered toast. Round and medium in size on the finish, with solid but correct tannins.",Crianza,87,16,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Viña Salceda
112363,Spain,"Warm and the slightest bit raisiny, but overall it's a bright, fruity blend of Monastrell and Tempranillo that's tasty and worth every dollar. Flavors of black cherry and vanilla are cuddly, while the finish is long and of medium potency. A treat for those who enjoy fruity, somewhat softer reds.",Crianza,87,12,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Santonegro
112380,Spain,"Murky, with barnyard aromas. Bland but sour flavors. Not awful but not that appealing. Imported by Classical Wines.",Rosado,80,10,Northern Spain,Cigales,NA,Tempranillo,Fuente del Conde
112511,Spain,"Very dark and oaky, with lemon, bacon, charcoal and high-toned black fruit aromas. The palate is rich and warm, almost heavy, with intense blackberry, chocolate and figgy flavors. Shows very nice texture and size but also tips toward molten ripeness and heavy sweetness. Drink soon.",AlfaSpiga,90,47,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,O. Fournier
112518,Spain,"Dark, sweet and candied on the nose, with hints of raisin and licorice that become more prominent in the mouth. Saturated but also somewhat monotone and single-leveled in terms of flavor, where you get a narrow band of sweet black cherry and raisin in front of a short finish. Very nice as always, but not the best Allende we've reviewed.",Allende,89,26,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Finca Allende
112528,Spain,"A well-made and refreshing wine for the price. The nose is crisp and smells of nettles, grapefruit, cilantro and stony minerals, while the feel is zesty and the flavors bring a mix of green fruits, citrus and tropicality. Stays on point from start to finish. A fine wine for summer sipping.",NA,89,15,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Palacio de Bornos
112530,Spain,"Opens with exotic, earthy aromas and lots of black fruit, but it turns more quiet and timid with airing. The palate shows plenty of bright acidity and some heft and grab, while the flavors of dark berries and plum are accented by light herbal notes and other common Ribera accents like thyme and oregano.",Pavo Real Crianza,88,27,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Xavier Flouret
112537,Spain,"Slightly dusty, spicy and cider-like on the nose, with a tight palate holding nectarine, melon and apple flavors. It's fairly exact in terms of mouthfeel, while the finish is clean and reflects well on the wine. Drink now.",Esencia Diviña,88,23,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Adegas Gran Vinum
112593,Spain,"Old wines are not easy to appreciate, so we'd almost rather have you judge this wine. In our opinion, it's way too sour and lacking in fruit to justify rave reviews. Thirty years of age doesn't seem to have helped it, and what's left is sherried and pruny, yet with sharp acidity.",Castillo Ygay Gran Reserva Especial,83,225,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Marqués de Murrieta
112598,Spain,"Rather minty and herbal up front, with grassy, field-like aromas overriding the red fruit that wants to peek through. The palate offers only secondary fruit flavors that turn to cider if given time. Acceptable but doesn't offer much.",Mercedes Eguren Rosé,83,13,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bodegas Eguren
112608,Spain,"Past its prime. The nose is heavy and the palate deals minimal peach flavors. It's wet but losing clarity, with bland apple and pear flavors left on the finish. This is not quite dead but best to wait for 2007.",NA,83,20,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Castro Baroña
112657,Spain,"The nose kicks up ginger ale and a touch of lime, and that's followed by apple and mild citrus flavors. The mouthfeel is good and the finish crisp, clean and full of vibrant acidity. A perfectly fine and pleasant cava, but nothing out of the ordinary.",Brut,86,13,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,1+1=3
112661,Spain,"Full and fruity as well as dense and structured. Not bad for an inexpensive Spanish red. The palate is fairly smooth but also a tad bit juicy. Chocolate, coffee and a dryness work the palate. Even shows some finesse along the way.",NA,86,7,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Infinitus
112667,Spain,"Lemon peel and zesty raspberry aromas greet you, and next in line comes a mouthful of sharp red-fruit flavors that are tangy and juicy. This represents the fresh, almost austere side of Tempranillo. It's also similar to most 2002s, which are more lean and tart than average.",Crianza,86,14,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Mayor
112671,Spain,"Yeasty and round, with aromas of citrus and spent campfire. The palate runs toward peach and cantaloupe with a brown sugar coating. A bit sweet and candied late, yet mouthfilling and pleasant.",Rosado Seco,86,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Castellblanch
112678,Spain,"Very round and candied, with a ton of vanilla on the nose. It's made in the supersweet style, as if it's supposed to go with wedding cake or caramel bon bons. Yet there's enough balance to keep it on an even keel, which should make it perfect for those raised on candy-sweet wines and their kin. Certainly not to everyone's liking but not a poorly made wine by any means.",Spumante,86,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
112770,Spain,"Nice on the bouquet, with aromas of licorice, tobacco, earth, mineral and solid berry fruit. The palate is a blend of power and smooth tannins, and the flavors of black fruit tilt toward fleshy, with buttery oak as an accent.

112771,Spain,"Initiates with savory, mildly soupy aromas on top of berry fruit. The palate is plump, ripe and balanced, with mocha, coffee and dark, meaty berry flavors. Toasty, dry and very solid on the finish, and convincingly rich as a whole.",JC,89,24,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Vizcarra
112773,Spain,"Miserere offers most of what you'd expect from a high-end Priorat red. The nose features mineral, grilled meat, raisin, berry, cherry and even a citrusy accent. The palate has a full, complete feel and warm flavors of black cherry, licorice and raisin. Very nice but one step short of excellence. Drink now through 2012.",Miserere,89,80,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Costers del Siurana
112777,Spain,"Toasty, earthy, chocolaty and meaty, but not overly fruity or sweet. The palate features solid structure and body, with rooty raspberry, plum, nutmeg and other spice-based flavors. A little rough and short on the finish, with firm tannins. Gets better the longer it sits, so decant or let breathe before pouring.",Cosme Palacio Reserva,89,25,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Palacio
112778,Spain,"Baked, roasted and earthy, with a deep palate of plum, berry and spice aromas. We wouldn't label this a complex or complicated wine; what you smell and taste initially is more or less what you get. Spicy and chocolaty on the finish, and satisfying.",Tábula,89,29,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas y Viñedos Tábula
112785,Spain,"Having not seen the Valsacro wines for several years, it's nice to know that they are up to good things. This is a dark wine dominated by aromas of cassis liqueur and earth. It's lively and structured, with layers of toasted berry, chocolate and black pepper flavors. Shows a lot of shadings and trimmings, including creamy oak on the finish. Drink now and over the next two years.",NA,89,31,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Red Blend,Valsacro
112786,Spain,"Aromas of mineral and jammy raspberry are attractive, yet the palate seems a bit metallic and clicky, with hard to penetrate flavors of rooty fruits, vanilla, coconut and cola. Opens with airing to display secondary berry fruit flavors in front of a tough, firm finish. Nice and ripe, and ready to drink.",Furvus,89,34,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Red Blend,Vinyes Doménech
112794,Spain,"Solid as a rock, with earthy berry and mild herbal aromas. The palate is firm and a touch angular, with sweet raisin, blackberry, candy and chocolate flavors.

112853,Spain,"Pickled on the nose, with aromas that hint at white grapes such as Verdejo. This is jumpy and unsettled, with citrus and white grapefruit flavors leaving a tangy burn on the finish. Jangled and sharp.",Solaz Rosado,82,9,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Rosé,Osborne
112858,Spain,"Given the high level at which Rioja is running these days, this green wine with aromas of pole beans and tobacco ash just isn't up to standards. Balance and elegance are nowhere to be found.",Añada,81,NA,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Lar de Paula
112860,Spain,"Meaty and composed, with an earthy nose that carries plenty of dark fruit and minty herbal accents. The palate shows clarity and density, but it's a touch gritty, hard and tannic. Flavors of cola, blackberry and burnt toast are masculine, while the finish is also kind of crusty and dark.",Barrancos de Pizarra,88,48,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Garnacha,Pegaso
112880,Spain,"Earthy black cherry aromas give this easygoing Rioja an honest and true nose. The palate is almost what you'd call flush, but on the other hand it's snappy and fresh, with commendable black cherry and plum flavors. With a touch of oak and mocha on the finish, it's a complete wine that should come across familiar.",Viña Zaco,87,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Bilbainas
112952,Spain,"Round up front, with solid fruit aromas mixed with oak and vanilla. In the mouth, it features bold cherry and raspberry flavors supported by zesty acidity and bold tannins. Finishes full, with a lot of oak-driven butter. More than competent.",Real Reserva,86,25,Northern Spain,Cigales,NA,Tempranillo,Museum
112954,Spain,"Deep and secure on the nose, with richness and a strong whiff of fresh leather. The palate is serious as it deals black fruit and spice. Chocolate and rugged tannins carry the hard, almost grabby finish. A power¬ful but approachable blend.",El Miracle 120,86,10,Levante,Valencia,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Vicente Gandia
112968,Spain,"Much more spicy and nuanced than most cavas, whether we're talking rosado or not. This one begins with aromas of black gumdrops and orange drink. The palate echoes the nose as it displays star anise and Sambuca flavors along with distant citrus. A different breed that's both odd and intriguing.",Brut Rosé,86,16,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Pinot Noir,Juvé y Camps
112970,Spain,"Tight-grained oak on top of slightly herbal fruit gives this wine an Old World bouquet. Juicy cherry, raspberry and olive flavors work the palate, followed by an acidic, drying finish that lasts for quite a while. Lean and zesty; this has definite merits.",Reserva,86,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Baron De Ley
112973,Spain,"Open on the bouquet, with a pleasant spiciness. The flavors veer toward tangy nectarine and apricot, while the snappy finish is long and slightly bitter. Shows good citrus character and plenty of pop. Quite good for a white from central Spain.",NA,86,10,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Viura,Finca Antigua
112975,Spain,"This is a perfectly good, fairly dark Garnacha that oozes bacon smoke and blueberry syrup aromas. The palate is mildly zesty due to adequate acidity, while the blackberry flavors carry a certain savory quality along with firm tannins.",Tintorera,86,9,Central Spain,Almansa,NA,Garnacha,Castillo de Almansa
112976,Spain,"Round and balanced, with a nice mix of cherry, spice and leather on the bouquet. The palate comes across as totally fresh and zesty, with ample red fruit pumped up by acidity that creates a slight citric character. Racy and crisp wine; nice with chorizo or other basic foods.",Glorioso Crianza,86,11,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Palacio
112977,Spain,"Sweet black fruit starts up the engine, and beyond that it mostly tastes like raspberry and plum. Quite big and fruity, with a peppery streak to the finish. Registers full but a bit tough, with some tannic bite.",Ars Nova,86,25,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Red Blend,Tandem
113029,Spain,"The best new release in the Eguren family's collection of modern Rioja wines is this small-production, 100% Tempranillo.

113039,Spain,"The bouquet explodes with tobacco, leather, dry oak and waves of berry fruit. In the mouth, the wine sits comfortably on the tongue, with firm tannins offering structure to the bedazzling boysenberry, black cherry and cassis flavors. Long and intoxicating on the finish.

113075,Spain,"An immense, heavily concentrated and sweet wine with aromas of bacon, wood smoke, citrus peel and jammy berry. The palate is rich and unctuous, so much so that it might qualify as syrupy in some circles. The flavors run toward roasted berries, fig paste and chocolate, and all totaled it's bold but a little overripe. Drink now.",NA,89,77,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,O. Fournier
113085,Spain,"Some patience is required to plow through the early aromas of cherry cough drops, bitter chocolate and smoke, but once you make it past that the wine turns decidedly red and fresh. The palate has tang and a citrusy quality, while flavors of zesty red fruits hint at lemon and pie cherry. A high-toned wine that's ready to drink now and over the next five years with lamb or beef.",Reserva,89,40,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Finca Valpiedra
113086,Spain,"Aromas of apple, fresh hay, pineapple and natural vanilla draw you in, while the palate is lively and fresh, with citrus, pineapple and pithy lemon flavors.

113091,Spain,"Black as night, with chunky, sweet, candied aromas as well as notes of bacon, shoe polish and cough medicine. This is a classic modern-styled wine with intense roasted berry, herb and exotic spice flavors. Licorine, prune, coffee and oak emerge on the broad finish. Very ripe yet it does a good job of straddling the line between big and overripe.",NA,89,16,Central Spain,Almansa,NA,Red Blend,Atalaya
113144,Spain,"Round, mossy and deep smelling, but austere in the mouth. A berry and plum flavor profile is infused with tomato and herbal notes, while the finish is long, healthy and cleansing. Very sturdy and Navarran in every sense because it blends juicy fruit with cool-climate typicity. Good but not for fans of sweet, bulky, superripe reds.",Crianza,87,17,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Finca Albret
113150,Spain,"Pleasant but a little light on the nose, with candied fruit notes. Flavors of green melon, apple and citrus are standard fare and clean, while the feel is fresh and peachy. A balanced and nice wine, but not overly exciting or precise. Drink now with salad or fish.",NA,87,18,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,As Laxas
113164,Spain,"Not all of the new wines that we see from up and coming regions like Montsant are good. This one is a lean, burnt and minty offering with an odd baked, nutty character. Not up to standards.",Brunus,81,30,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Red Blend,Portal del Montsant
113165,Spain,"Mature for Cariñena, but it's still a hard wine with juniper and other narrow aromas. The palate is almost sour, with tight tannins and noticeable astringency.",Gran Reserva,81,22,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Red Blend,Monasterio de las Viñas
113170,Spain,"Modest on the nose, and then very little after that. The flavors are basic lime and citrus, and the feel is tangy and lemony sharp. Generic, with little to no varietal character.",Mercedes Eguren,81,13,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Sauvignon Blanc,Bodegas Eguren
113179,Spain,"Best on the nose, but sharp and narrow as can be on the palate. Cranberry and sour cherry flavors dominate, while the finish is astringent. No amount of swirling and saving is going help it much.",Oak Aged,80,17,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Tempranillo-Merlot,Reula
113229,Spain,"Red fruit, hints of spice and a touch of herbal essence kick it off. The palate is leafy and drying, with medium-ripe cherry and berry flavors. Quite your basic red table wine, and if that's what you're looking for it's not disappointing.",Gran Feudo Crianza,85,11,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Julián Chivite
113230,Spain,"Heavy, with a lot of oak, which is reflected in both the amber color and the aromas. Flavors of vanilla, lemon drop, banana and wood resin take a moment or two to get used to, but they grow on you. Not a lot of complexity or breadth, but interesting for what it is.",Conde de Valdemar Blanco,85,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Viura,Bodegas Valdemar
113231,Spain,"Attractive on the nose, with violet, cherry and a bit of candy. Round and satisfying in the mouth, with full berry flavors and mouthcoating tannins.

113236,Spain,"A touch minty and rustic, but with enough black cherry, marmalade and tannin to make the grade. Jammy, medium in density and solid. A stout, friendly red made for early drinking.",NA,85,10,Central Spain,Madrid,NA,Tempranillo,Merum
113240,Spain,"Warm and earthy, with a round, ripe nose. The palate is a touch on the sweet, cooked side, but it avoids being stewy or soupy and instead shows ripe black fruit, licorice and smoked meat. Quite soft and low in acid. Drink right away.",Crianza,85,12,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Red Blend,Finca Antigua
113247,Spain,"A sweet, almost punch-bowl nose greets you, followed by mellow apple and tropical fruit flavors. Medium-bodied and generally balanced, with shy but layered flavors and dryness that offers a bit of complexity.",NA,85,12,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Viña Mocen
113283,Spain,"Classic in color, and backed by aromatics of lavender, graphite and pure blackberry. This is not overly weighty, as the acidity keeps it pointed and pure. There's a lot of elegance and balance to this wine; a perfect example of how to blend multiple vineyards into one excellent whole.",Pagos Viejos,95,95,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Artadi
113284,Spain,"Masculine and heady stuff, as leather, espresso, smoked meat, mocha and intense blackberry aromas set the stage for an intense, driven, structured palate that's full of coconut, vanilla bean, cocoa and pure plum and berry. A serious nuevo classico Rioja if there ever was one.",Altos de Lanzaga,95,105,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Telmo Rodríguez
113285,Spain,"What a superb combination of new oak, leather, mineral, mocha and berry fruit this wine delivers. It's a giant, with a ripped palate of upfront boysenberry and then coffee and vanilla in support. All the power, precision and other attributes of modern Rioja are on display. Best in a few more years.",Finca El Bosque,95,145,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
113286,Spain,"Full and ready, this fabulous wine from Rioja Alavesa sets the bar very high for any of its Vanguardia co-runners. Gloria hits hard with bacon, tire rubber, tobacco and pastry crust aromas, but also pure dark fruit. Then it's wave after wave of boysenberry and crisped brown sugar flavors prior to a finale of heady European chocolate. Need we say more? 750 cases produced; best now through 2011.",Gloria de Ostatu,95,75,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Ostatu
113292,Spain,"Plant-by-plant fruit selection leads to intensity, concentration and structure. Aro shows gripping tannins and juicy acidity, and overall it reeks of power and precision.

113300,Spain,"Only a select portion of a prized 30-year-old vineyard gives fruit to the wine named after the Eguren brothers' great grandfather.

113302,Spain,"One half of the wine is lush and opulent, the other juicy, fresh and pulsing with the essence of old-vines Rioja fruit. So for every note of molasses, burnt toast, chocolate or baked berry pie, there's a twinge of acidity, a spike of tannin and a dollop of earthy terroir. Tempranillo with 15% Graciano. 500 cases made.

113305,Spain,"Slightly tighter and more complex than previous years, this single-  vineyard wine delivers a ton of spice and herbs on a masculine bouquet and palate.

Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",San Vicente,93,57,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Senorio de San Vincente
113307,Spain,"This is yet another magnetic example from the Eguren stable that includes El Puntido, San Vicente, Finca El Bosque and the many Sierra Cantabria wines. It's a racy, red-fruit dominated Tempranillo with raspberry, plum and cassis flavors accented by firm, almost blazing acidity. It's definitely tighter and more compact than the more generous, richer 2005 La Nieta. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",La Nieta,93,145,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Viñedos de Paganos
113375,Spain,"A nicely made and easy to like kind of young Ribera red with clean, bold blackberry aromas and flavors that fit the wine's big, tannic structure. Composed on the back palate and beefy on the finish. Perfect for grilled meats. Drink now through 2012.",Viña Pilar Crianza,88,22,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Felix Callejo
113383,Spain,"Dark in color and hefty for an '07, with vanilla, balsam wood and berry aromas. The feel and body here are appropriate, while the flavors of black cherry and plum are snappy, direct, pure and clean. Bold, lively and nice, but nothing too complicated or powerful.",Spiga,88,31,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,O. Fournier
113384,Spain,"This is a higher-end blend from Onix, and it offers an earthy, almost compost-like opening with leafy notes of tobacco, coffee grinds, leather and hard cheese. The palate is solidly built, with cheek-blasting berry and coffee flavors. Toasty on the back end, with bitter chocolate. Very big but lacks some precision and purity of aromas and flavors. Drink now through 2012.",Fusió,88,32,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Onix
113385,Spain,"Roasted and dark on the nose, with raisin, prune and exotic spice aromas. The palate is chewy and a bit lemony, with sweet baked fruit flavors and a load of chocolaty richness. Mocha and fudge are the key finishing notes, and overall this is a proper yet full-bodied big boy.",NA,88,44,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Valpiculata
113390,Spain,"Big, bawdy, hard and concentrated, with black fruit and floral aromas. The palate is grabby and fully tannic, while the flavors run toward blackberry, coffee and vanilla. Rich and espresso-like on the finish, with no shortage of oak and richness. Very big at 15% alcohol.",Crianza,88,57,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Pago de Carraovejas
113391,Spain,"Fruity, minerally and nice, with aromas of pear, apple and pineapple that make you want to take a drink. The palate is juicy and fresh, with slate-driven green apple and citrus flavors. Quick on the finish, with a revisiting of the wine's mineral component.",Alma de Blanco,88,15,Galicia,Monterrei,NA,Godello,Pazo das Tapias
113411,Spain,"Berry, earth and a touch of citrus peel make for a good bouquet, while the palate shows structure and lots of verve. The flavor profile of plum, cherry and roasted berry is solid and complete, while the finish is fresh, clean and reaches a proper finale. Call it a well-made but familiar type of old-vines Garnacha.",Tinta,87,16,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra Ribera del Jiloca,NA,Garnacha,Vega del Jiloca
113413,Spain,"Clean, fresh and layered up front, with peach, cherry and nectarine flavors and then apricot on the finish. The feel is good throughout, with no excess weight or sweetness. An uncomplicated, no-frills rosé, which is what Navarra and Señoría de Sarria do best.",Rosado,87,10,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Grenache,Señorío de Sarria
113416,Spain,"Interesting blanco from the inland Galician region of Ribeira Sacra. It's Albariño with 15% Godello, and it's ready to drink now. Aromas of pulpy peach and pineapple are nice, while the apple and lime flavors are fairly gentle and flush. Finishes with adequate freshness for an '07, making it a no-qualms type of white wine.",NA,87,16,Galicia,Ribeira Sacra,NA,Albariño,Abadía da Cova
113494,Spain,"For the most part this is a full-bodied, full-fruited wine that has what it takes to win people over. The nose is full of cherry, plum, licorice and coconut, while the palate is bright and ripe. It's a bit clumsy and not all that complex, but you can't knock the power and extract.",Reserva,85,15,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Red Blend,Finca Antigua
113500,Spain,"This is a good table wine with sweet, woodsy aromas of sandalwood, clove, cinnamon and earth. The palate turns a bit to the tangy, sharp side. But in a world with so many overripe heavyweights, this edgy, almost racy blend has the right stuff.",NA,85,10,Central Spain,Castilla La Mancha,NA,Shiraz-Tempranillo,Día Naciente
113504,Spain,"Smells a touch green and pasty, and while the wine is deep and dark, there isn't a whole lot of definition or specificity to it. Sweet and heavy in the mouth, with chocolate notes. Creamy on the finish, with minimal flavor. Not bad but doesn't have an identifiable personality.",NA,85,45,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Valpiculata
113506,Spain,"Round in style, with soft white-fruit and apple blossom aromas. Tastes a touch reduced, as if the lemon, lime and melon flavors had been condensed and amplified. The finish is lively, with citrus and some pithiness. Good but limited.",NA,85,13,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Lagar de Costa
113510,Spain,"Fairly big and muscular, with black fruit, cinnamon and olive notes on the nose. The palate is beefy and deep, with plum and blackberry flavors. With big tannins and a full-bodied personality, this is not a lightweight.",NA,85,10,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Merlot,Finca Antigua
113512,Spain,"Some early pickle and sauerkraut aromas were worrisome until they completely disappeared. Left in their wake are flavors of apple juice and peaches, while the mouthfeel registers as solid and full. A little funky and definitely not for everyone, given the wine's overt sweetness and oddities.",Carta Nevada Semi Dry,85,9,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
113513,Spain,"Not a complete swing and a miss, but nothing special despite the miniscule production and higher-than-normal price. The color is pale and the nose has some gaps. In the mouth, you get dry soda crackers and white-peach flavors. Finishes with lime and apple. No glaring faults but hollow.",XXI Brut,85,25,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
113516,Spain,"Fairly sweet and fruity, with notes of raspberry jam and cotton candy on the bouquet. Feels nice across the palate, with tangy strawberry and red-cherry flavors leading to a fresh, wet, bright finish. A good but pedestrian wine at a reasonable price.",Rosado de Lagrima,85,9,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Garnacha,Viña Sardasol
113580,Spain,"A very pretty middle-aged wine that has at least another decade in it. At this point in time, the nose is still showing a lot of black-fruit aromas, while the palate is chewy, meaty and rich as it spreads out with ripe flavors mixed with touches of mushroom, truffle and vanilla. A fine Gran Reserva with equal bits of tradition and modernity showing through.",Gran Reserva,93,35,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
113590,Spain,"Beautiful in color as it blends hues of purple and red. The nose is endowed with leather, herbs and cherry, while the full palate houses a delicious range of fruit and wood flavors along with fine tannins and length. It's like a new-school classic with a traditional name and packaging. 1,250 cases made. Good now thru 2016.

113596,Spain,"Char and chocolate, then a dollop of rum raisin and black cherry, and there is your nose. This version of Cirsion, one of our very favorite modern Riojas, is relatively soft, raisiny and simple, and for that it doesn't quite rate with some of the past vintages, which were spectacular. But that doesn't mean you won't love the wine's smooth texture, cocoa and baked berry flavors, and its overall generous character. Drink now through 2010.",Cirsion,92,273,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Roda
113598,Spain,"Right away this shows the requisite signs of excellence. The meaty, earthy, leathery, full-fruit nose is just right, and the palate is elevated in how it is infused with pure blackberry and plum as well as chocolate and fine herbs. Finishes with class and kick. Best from 2008–2011.",Altos de Lanzaga,92,82,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Telmo Rodríguez
113599,Spain,"Like all young Sierra Cantabria wines made from old vines, this has a purple color that's supported by aromas of coffee, mocha and black fruits. It's half aged in American oak (the other half is French), and it's much more tannic, acidic and structured than the fleshy 2003. A wine with pure flavors and a dynamic structure.

113604,Spain,"Benjamin Romeo makes nothing but big, idiosyncratic wines. And some are big hits while others may not be your thing. This modern, round, polished blend is creamy and smooth but also loaded with almond, pear, citrus and toast flavors. Certainly there's a strong wood element, but it handles it with aplomb and oozes class. Drink as soon as possible. It won't age much past 2007. Only 25 cases made.",Qué Bonito Cacareaba,92,74,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Benjamin Romeo
113608,Spain,"Robust and sexy, with smoke, leather and pure berry and plum aromas that make for a sensational bouquet. The palate is up to the precedent set by the nose, as the cherry and cola flavors are outright lovely. For what you get, this is almost a value. It shows us what that Muga can do in a great vintage.",Selección Especial Reserva,92,37,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Muga
113609,Spain,"Stylish and serious, with polished, fancy oak sitting like royalty atop dark   fruit that is almost pruney.

Not quite at the level of the classic 2001 but still excellent.",El Puntido,92,54,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Viñedos de Paganos
113641,Spain,"Floral and lighter bodied, with attractive red fruit aromas and a modicum of exotic spice. The palate is tight, pure and a little sharp and pointed, while the flavors are of flashy, zesty raspberry. A juicy wine that treads lightly rather than with a hammer.",C21,88,25,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto Fino,Cepa 21
113643,Spain,"Leafy and spicy, with notes of paprika, tomato, dried leaves and broth. But in the mouth, it's fresh and vital, with good balance and flavors of dried cassis, tobacco and herbs. For an older wine from industrial Valdepeñas it's doing a good job. But now is the time to drink it.",Gran Reserva,88,15,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,NA,Tempranillo,Anciano
113644,Spain,"Smoky and dry, with aromas of tire rubber and mildly herbal, leafy red fruits. The palate has a dry, rugged, scratchy feel while the flavors veer toward baked raspberry, earth notes and coffee. Finishes nicely, with berry fruit at first and then herbal, oaky afternotes.",NA,88,19,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Arrocal
113651,Spain,"Dark and very toasty, with espresso, bacon and roasted black fruit aromas. Tight and drying in the mouth, with biting tannins, a lot of oak and finally mildly herbal flavors of blackberry and burnt toast. Hard and dark, but big and boisterous, with a blatant barrel influence.",Abuela Cleofé,88,50,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Paramo de Corcos
113656,Spain,"Leather, tobacco, citrus peel and herbs make for a controlled bouquet that doesn't smack you in the face. The body, however, is tannic and grabby, while the flavors of sweet berry carry a roasted angle and a dash of spice. Chocolaty and spicy on the finish, but again it goes down hard and tannic, which is a drawback.",Reserva,88,70,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Resalte
113662,Spain,"Very sweet and rich, and probably a little too much so for some folks. Aromas of cassis, berry liqueur and black fruit candy are sweet, sweet, sweet, but after the sugary richness subsides you do get a dark, brooding, mammoth Garnacha with prune, chocolate and baked power. A 15.5% heavyweight to drink before 2011.",Atteca Armas Old Vines,88,45,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Garnacha,Bodegas Ateca
113716,Spain,"Cuatro implies four grapes blended together, and the nose on this Tempranillo/Cab/Merlot/Syrah mix is a bit leathery and tight. In the mouth, it's linear and borderline lean, with plum and bramble flavors backstopped by tomato and herb notes. Juicy, intense and solid, but not overly generous or evolved. Typical Somontano red wine.",Cuatro,87,40,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Red Blend,Olvena
113764,Spain,"For years this wine was a big-time bargain from Navarra. Now it's not so inexpensive yet the quality is the same. There's common nectarine and raspberry aromas before snappy peach and berry flavors. It's juicy and modest, with crispness and a drying finish.",Gran Feudo Rosé,85,12,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Garnacha,Bodegas Julián Chivite
113765,Spain,"Light and modest in aromas, although scents of citrus blossom and nectarine manage to work their way to the top of the bouquet. The palate is smooth and creamy, with flavors of red plum, melon and chocolate. A good wine that won't make you go crazy looking for complexities and depth.",Rosado,85,14,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Bohigas
113769,Spain,"Plump and full of plum and licorice aromas. Weighs in big and a touch sweet, with black cherry and ripe plum flavors. Very soft in the feel department, with a soft finish that's like a cushioned fall. Healthy as a whole, with lively tannins.",Old Vines,85,16,Spain Other,Spain,NA,Grenache-Syrah,Merum
113772,Spain,"This full-bodied, cherry-dominated Garnacha is pretty good considering the price. The nose is a bit raisiny and ripe, while the palate is sweet but balanced. A standard red wine with clarity and no surprises.",NA,84,6,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Garnacha,Castillo de Monséran
113782,Spain,"This Monastrell-based rosado is indicative of the Jumilla region, meaning it's sweet, a bit heavy, and fairly candied in its aromas. Flavors of fleshy raspberry and strawberry are full, while the round finish is neutral. Low in acid; drink right away.",Rosado,84,10,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Rosé,Alceño
113786,Spain,"Sweet and floral, like light berries with crushed flower petals. The palate is not as comforting; it's acidic and bouncy, which fosters good flavors but a jagged, jumpy mouthfeel. You want to like this wine but the feel doesn't make it easy.",Reserva,84,11,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,NA,Tempranillo,Laguna de la Nava
113789,Spain,"Pretty good for a $6 sparkler, even if the nose has a whiff of rubber band and wet clay to go along with light citrus and cherry aromas. The palate is fruity and carbonated, so you get spritz with your cherry, strawberry and tangerine flavors. Good for sparkling Sangria as well as casual sipping.",Mediterranean Pétillant,84,6,Catalonia,Catalonia,NA,Rosé,René Barbier
113846,Spain,"It has taken this bodega a few years to get it right, but in 2004 this blend of 80% Tempranillo and 20% Cabernet is dark and rocking. The nose offers that modern but increasingly familiar blast of bacon, baked fruit pastry and leather, and the palate works its magic with black plum and smoked game flavors. If it were just a touch longer and richer toward the finish it might rank as a nuevo classico.",Finca Monasterio,91,42,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Baron De Ley
113940,Spain,"Opens with black fruit aromas, dry oak and spice. The palate shows an oaky creaminess, sticky tannins and solid berry fruit flavors that are matched and maybe even trumped by buttery oak. A little dry and drawing on the finish, but still a very nice RDD.",NA,88,25,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto Fino,Emilio Moro
113949,Spain,"A black wine with aromas of graphite, molten earth and black fruit. The palate is a pounder with strong tannins and blazing acidity, and that creates a mouthfeel with grating intensity and roasted black fruit flavors. Lively late, with herbal notes and a lasting tannic bite. At over 15% alcohol, there's a lot of fire and toughness, so hold for a few more years and hopefully the tannins will soften.",Reserva,88,25,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Prado Rey
113959,Spain,"Flowery and fresh, with a bit of talc and creaminess to the bouquet. A little soft in the mouth, but still wet and likable. Flavors of lemon-lime and celery are solid, while the finish is dry and peachy. Treixadura, Godello, Loureira and Albariño comprise the grape blend.",NA,88,18,Galicia,Ribeiro,NA,White Blend,Viña Mein
113963,Spain,"Tropical smelling, with green banana, minerality and firmness to the bouquet. The palate is clean and cleansing, which are two very different things, while the wine tastes of tangy citrus and green melon. Fresh, tropical and uncomplicated. Drink this year.",NA,88,14,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Lícia
114063,Spain,"Smoky, grapey and spicy on the nose. The palate is full and aggressive in a bring-it-on sort of way. It's a touch heavy and tannic, but it's also pretty long and toasty on the finish.",NA,84,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Legado Muñoz
114064,Spain,"Seems like the brutal heat of 2003 got to this wine in a negative way. The result is a thick, unctuous, syrupy wine with a ton of sweetness but not much balance. The alcohol is listed at 15.5%, and it seems bigger. Very much a heavyweight, and with no agility.",El Albar Excelencia,84,40,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,J. & F. Lurton
114071,Spain,"Apple and peach define the bouquet, but where's the pop? This cava seems a touch quiet and reticent. It's drying, with flavors of apple, white corn and soda cracker. But the bead is weak and the overall personality is shy. Has 15% Chardonnay in addition to the traditional cava three-pack of Macabeo, Parellada and Xarello.",Gran Reserva Brut Nature,84,18,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Bohigas
114075,Spain,"Sweet cherry and berry aromas are blended with cookie dough scents to create a simple, easy bouquet.

Shows some kick and tannins at its core.",NA,84,7,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Infinitus
114076,Spain,"Slightly amber in color, with pastry, peach and pear aromas. The palate is tangy, with flavors of green apple along with some bitterness. Finishes light and dry, with zest and freshness. Simple yet solid.",Chardonnay-Viura,84,7,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,White Blend,Infinitus
114180,Spain,"With its spice and fig aromas, this registers as a rich, mature Rioja reserva. The palate runs toward sweet plums and blackberry, while the finish is mildly toasty and full, with coffee as the lasting flavor. This has many good qualities, not the least of which is balance and a touch of citrus peel. Best now–2010. 525 cases produced.",Cata de Consejero,91,58,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Consejo de la Alta
114181,Spain,"A sweet, ripe, jammy style for Roda I, with smooth tannins, corpulence and more than adequate minerality and power. This is not a flabby wine despite the heat of the vintage, and the lush cassis, blackberry and mocha notes come together on the back palate and finish.",Roda I,91,73,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Roda
114182,Spain,"Thick, brooding and aromatically mature, this delivers heft, grab and balance. It has developed black-fruit flavors followed by a cushioned, soft finish.

Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Reserva,91,77,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Remírez de Ganuza
114187,Spain,"You're going to like this masculine, well-oaked blend of 80% Tempranillo with 10% each Graciano and Garnacha. It's got modern touches but a lot of tradition as well. The wine is rich and round, with tobacco, coffee, chocolate and earth creating depth and character. With fine mouthfeel and a solid finish, you can drink now or hold a few more years.",Coto Real Reserva,91,46,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,El Coto
114191,Spain,"This seems eminently ageworthy; it has the strong foundation and pulsing acidity required of a true cellar dweller. The raspberry and plum fruit have a beam of acidity and the tannins are not shy. Shows all the hallmarks of a fine modern Rioja: power, purity and balance. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Torre Muga,91,90,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Muga
114197,Spain,"A dense wine from the start, and each subsequent whiff of the oaky but vital nose is convincing. The palate here is exemplary, especially for an '02; there's dark berry and plum flavors backed by notes of black licorice and pepper. An exceedingly nice wine with a textbook mix of tannins, flesh and acidity.",Reserva,91,28,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Ostatu
114241,Spain,"Minerality is a major player in this peachy white blend that throws off some salinity and pool water on the nose. The palate has a round balance to it, while the flavors of lemon-lime, pineapple and mango get it done. Fresh and melony on the finish.",Vendimia Oro,88,36,Galicia,Ribeiro,NA,White Blend,Bodegas Docampo
114242,Spain,"Colorful and fresh, with a bit of latex/Band-Aid on the nose to go with bacon, raspberry and oak-based maple aromas. The feel is stout and chewy, while flavors of cassis, cherry and chocolate work well together. An oaky customer but a good and tasty one. Drink now and over the next two years.",Old Vines Reserva,88,17,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Navarro López
114246,Spain,"Slightly earthy and herbal, as Somontano reds are prone to be, with a gritty mouthfeel and sweet black fruit flavors that come with proper herbal accents. Tastes roasted and toasty, with pepper and heat on the lusty finish. Balanced and good; drink now through 2013.",Gran Vos Reserva,88,20,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Red Blend,Viñas del Vero
114255,Spain,"Clean, solid aromas of black cherry and berry are just what you want from Spanish Monastrell, and while this isn't the most unique or original wine, it sure is tasty, balanced and pleasing. Flavors of lightly baked black fruits are lush, while the finish is medium-long and easygoing. Hard to find anything wrong with this affordable red from Alicante.",La Tremenda,88,11,Levante,Alicante,NA,Monastrell,Enrique Mendoza
114265,Spain,"From Freixenet, this is perfectly good yet familiar, which for $15 is about as good as we can expect. The palate is juicy and also smooth, with red berry, tomato and herbal flavors. There's good depth and balance throughout, and the finish rounds into form and closes things out in a tasty, subdued fashion.",Crianza,88,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Vaza
114323,Spain,"A solid, earthy style of Navarran red wine, with plum, berry and meaty aromas. The palate is forward, with solid flavors of tobacco, plum, tomato and leather. More fruity than herbal, with heat, thyme, mocha and coffee on the finish. Tastes like something from the Old World. Not currently imported.",Malón de Echaide Crianza,87,NA,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodega del Romero
114324,Spain,"Dried fruit, a touch of compost and then bold coffee and mocha aromas give the wine a decent nose, and the palate, while zesty and snappy, is endowed with pretty good raspberry, cherry and strawberry flavors. Overall it's fruity and ready to drink but fairly ordinary, and while we like the wine we can't say it's a knockout.",Barón d'Anglade,87,50,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Franco-Españolas
114360,Spain,"Round and sweet up front, with aromas of candied berries. More alert and red-fruit dominated on the palate, with snappy acidity keeping it well propped up. Finishes with bright acidity and modest tannins. Straight-ahead red wine with crispness.",NA,84,10,Central Spain,Castilla La Mancha,NA,Shiraz,Día Naciente
114361,Spain,"Black raspberry and raisin control the bouquet on this carbonically macerated wine from inland Valencia. Lively plum and black cherry work the rubbery, mildly tannic palate, while the finish is leisurely enough. A touch narrow in flavor but broad in feel.",Mi Niña,84,11,Levante,Utiel-Requena,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Iranzo
114365,Spain,"Albariño is not known for its aging potential, and this wine already seems to be on the way out. The nose veers toward apricot and cider, as does the palate. Finishes with a final kick of acidity. Drink soon, or wait for the 2005.",NA,84,21,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Don Olegario
114369,Spain,"Jammy and full of raisin, stewed berries and leather. Calling it ultraripe might be an understatement because it's nearly over the top in its heft, extract and tannin level. A high-production bruiser that has tons of power but very little precision.",Tinto Joven,84,11,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Cermeño
114372,Spain,"Hits with force as well as notes of raisin and Sherry. No doubt this comes from a hot vintage, evidenced by the prune, brandied cherry and chocolate flavors. Still there's some tannin to keep it moving ahead. Overall, however, it's pretty heavy and condensed.",Crianza,84,11,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas LAN
114384,Spain,"Mildly floral and tropical at first, but then it seems to go heavy and flat on the bouquet the longer it sits. Look for decent grapefruit and tangerine flavors on a healthy but rudimentary cassis.",NA,83,10,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,White Blend,Inspiración Pampano
114386,Spain,"The color is an odd orange, which should come as an indicator that not all is right with this wine. The bouquet starts with dust on a warming radiator, and there's some vanilla as well. Soft citrus and nectarine flavors work the palate, followed by a round but somewhat mushy finish.",Brut de Noirs,83,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
114393,Spain,"Broad-shouldered and muscled-up, this hearty wine seems more youthful than it is. The nose is spicy and full of lively berry aromas, while the palate is laced with red cherry, raspberry and vanilla. It's a classic gran reserva with dried qualities and spice. It's right on the money.",Coto de Imaz Gran Reserva,91,39,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,El Coto
114399,Spain,"Bramble, cherry cola and snappy red berry aromas announce this as a secure, snappy wine. The flavor profile is round, genial and nicely balanced between plum and berry and vanilla/mocha notes. Like most Sierra Cantabria reds, this touches all the bases and should elicit a smile of satisfaction.",Cuvée Especial,91,24,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
114517,Spain,"Dark berry, spice cake, savory leather and roasted meat aromas give this a deep, brooding, heavy exterior. The mouth has acceptable acidic kick for Toro, while the flavors are saucy and meaty, with licorice and earth notes. Not overly fruity or lively; it's more meaty and thick.",NA,87,19,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Finca Sobreño
114522,Spain,"The nose of red fruits comes with oak, mocha and toast, while the palate is crisp and tight, with juicy, dry red berry flavors and backgroud notes of chocolate and spice. Seems like an Old World throwback due to its leaner body and an emphasis on dry spice and acid-driven red fruit.",Cosme Palacio,87,18,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Palacio
114526,Spain,"More tan in color than the usual light yellow, with true aromas of flower blossoms, lemon and tropical fruits. The acidity is a bit pronounced and scouring, but that only means that the citrus and green apple flavors cut and cleanse. Juicy but modest when it comes to depth of flavor. Drink now.",NA,87,20,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Valmiñor
114536,Spain,"A bit rubbery and earthy, with compost, smoky bacon and black fruit aromas. Nicely balanced with a good mouthfeel, and showing solid berry and plum flavors. Peppery on the finish, with some roasted overtones. Perfectly good for a tough vintage.",NA,87,28,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Alonso del Yerro
114566,Spain,"This five-grape blend is based on Treixadura but also includes Albariño, Loureira, Lado and Torrontès. The grapes were picked well into October, so the richness and alcohol are up there. Still, the flowery aromas are alluring and the flavors of mango, pear and apple are clean despite some oak aging. Only 50 cases imported into the States.",Blanco,92,40,Galicia,Ribeiro,NA,White Blend,Emilio Rojo
114577,Spain,"Gets going with earthy, lightly leathery aromas of red fruits, and that bouquet is backed by lively raspberry, plum and fresh-tomato flavors. It's not narrow, but it's hardly broad either. Finishes with a lively herbal note.",Crianza,87,14,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo,Ochoa
114597,Spain,"Look for the wine wrapped in banana-yellow paper, and you'll likely be surprised and pleased by its ripe, clean aromas and easygoing plum and cherry flavors. It's medium-bodied and nice on the palate, with a smooth, nonprobing finish. It's 75% Garnacha and 25% Tempranillo done well.",Castillo de Fuendejalon Crianza,86,8,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Aragonesas
114598,Spain,"Dark, balsamic aromas blend with hints of wood, bramble and briar to give this wine rusticity, while the palate is slick and medium in weight, with black-fruit and tea-like flavors. It's a little narrow on the finish, but there's also a creamy, oak-driven vanilla flavor that softens things up. A good wine that's 70% Tempranillo and 30% Garnacha.",Becquer,86,22,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Escudero
114632,Spain,"Smells like cherries and fruit punch. The palate is snappy and simple, with red fruit front and center.

114639,Spain,"Brawny plum and blackberry aromas feature notes of bacon, rubber and leather, all of which lead you to expect big, ripe flavors. But the news is, those flavors aren't anywhere to be found. The profile is tangy and lean, with sharp berry notes. Quick and simple on the finish, with aggressive acidity and tannins.",NA,83,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Cosme Palacio y Hermanos
114643,Spain,"A wine searching for an identity. The nose deals menthol, licorice, grilled meat and molasses but little-to-no bright fruit. That heaviness transfers to the mouth, where marinated, baked flavors mix with green tomato. Fails to impress.",NA,83,36,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,Montecastro
114648,Spain,"Functional and fruity, with big aromas of plum and berry on the slightly foxy nose. Fully tannic across the palate, so it feels kind of hard. The big berry flavors are loud and basic.",NA,83,7,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Merlot,Infinitus
114652,Spain,Light raspberry and strawberry aromas lead into snappy berry flavors. The feel is almost astringent; call it tangy and tight. Juicy but also rubbery. Shows both positives and negatives.,NA,83,10,Central Spain,Castilla La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,Día Naciente
114654,Spain,"Far more lean, raw and rough than ideal, with a touch of burnt field on the nose. The palate keeps that raw, reedy taste, which is smoothed out by softening oak notes. Better on the finish than up front.",Abadia Mediterrània,83,30,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Costers del Priorat
114656,Spain,"It has been a few years since 2001 was a current vintage, and while Montsant wines can age, this one doesn't seem to be going anywhere in particular. The nose is overdone with heavy mint, menthol and cinnamon-driven oak, while the palate is jumpy and tannic. Not a cheap wine, but also not that great.",Clos D'Englora,83,40,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Red Blend,Cellers Baronia del Montsant
114657,Spain,"Earthy fruit aromas, blackberry and cola flavors and a soft, saturated finish all add up to a flush wine typical of La Mancha, where elegance is fleeting. And while this fruit-filled middleweight isn't off, it's not that alluring either.",Crianza,83,13,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Viña Jaraba
114658,Spain,"This wine is Cáceres' attempt at a modern (yet for the masses) Rioja, and frankly it's not working. The bouquet is nothing but an avalanche of coconut and butter, which stems from the barrel regimen the wine goes through. And the palate is loud, chunky and clumsy. Yes, there's big fruit and bulk; but it's grabby, oversized and overoaked.",MC,83,38,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marqués de Cáceres
114659,Spain,"After a couple of vintages of really raving about this Merlot, the '02, from a cool, wet vintage, just isn't that great. The nose is dominated by rhubarb and sharpness, while the palate offers peppery flavors and a rough feel. Plenty of olive on the finish brings ripeness into question.",Deyo,82,18,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Merlot,Castillo de Monjardin
114679,Spain,"Dark mineral, toasted French oak and black fruit carry the nose. This is a sturdy, nicely made high-end Rioja, but due to the heat of the year its range of flavors is narrow as it settles on baked plum and molasses. Medium long on the finish, with a lasting taste of chocolate.",Dalmau,90,100,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marqués de Murrieta
114783,Spain,"For a value-priced wine this scores well. The nose offers a nice mix of earth, warmth and berry fruit, while the palate is juicy, fresh and tastes of zesty berry. Composed on the finish, which is also fresh and lively. Perfect for by-the-glass or casual consumption.",NA,87,8,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Maximo
114784,Spain,"Chiseled aromas of lemon-lime and spring flowers are lean but clean, and that pretty much describes this blend of Treixadura, Torrontés and Palomino.

More basic than flashy, but nice in a neutral way.",NA,87,10,Galicia,Ribeiro,NA,White Blend,Pazo Ribeiro
114789,Spain,"The packaging and name are a little contrived, but what's in the bottle stands up to scrutiny. The aromas are warm and plummy, with a hint of toast and cream.

114796,Spain,"Mildly pickled and stemmy at first, with earthy compost aromas that fade and are replaced by raspberry and other berry fruit scents.

Brambly but with enough good fruit and body to make the cut.",Reserva,87,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,El Circulo
114802,Spain,"A clean, easygoing style of Albariño with salinic aromas along with apple and peach.

Finishes with tropical notes and pithy white grapefruit.",NA,87,20,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Paco & Lola
114805,Spain,"A mature, more traditional Spanish wine that's ready to drink.

114809,Spain,"Roasted berry, marzipan, prune, spice and earth are rolled into a solid whole on the bouquet, while the palate rides on the heavy side with grating tannins and deep but clumsy flavors of blackberry, raisin and fruitcake.

114822,Spain,"Pezas is the Meursault of Valdeorras. It starts with a smoky, slate-driven nose and then opens to reveal pear, green apple and vanilla flavors.

114833,Spain,"From extremely old Godello vines, this barrel-fermented wine comes only in magnums. It's currently showing a lot of oak, but it's also extremely well structured. It has an acid backbone that nobody could crack. Very serious, with intense apple, pear and minerality. Much like a fine Burgundy.",Pedrouzos 1.5L,92,80,Northern Spain,Valdeorras,NA,Godello,Bodegas Valderroa
114855,Spain,"Put this Spanish rosado in the summer rotation. The nose gives you raspberry and strawberry aromas in light, airy form but avoids the candied side of the rosé spectrum.

114911,Spain,"The bouquet mixes bramble and berry notes, which turn rougher and more vegetal as time passes. The palate is peppery and light, with just adequate cherry and berry flavors. A light, distant wine with some similarities to Beaujolais Nouveau.",NA,82,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Darien

114922,Spain,"Woodsy and smoky up front, which sort of hides the fact that there's very little fruit on the bones of this wine. On the palate, it's peppery and firm, with spiky tannins.",Crianza,82,10,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Pago de la Jaraba
114923,Spain,"Short and slightly chemical on the nose, with hard-to-define melon, citrus and apple flavors. A tart wine without too much going on.",Veliterra Joven,81,9,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,White Blend,Agricola Castellana
114925,Spain,"Light reddish in color, with dry cranberry aromas and a strong hint of spearmint. Surprisingly heavy in the mouth, with slightly cooked flavors and a wave of burnt brown sugar on the finish. A wine with some issues.",Old Vines,81,10,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,La Riada
114926,Spain,"This Navarran winery usually does well, but its '02 Crianza isn't up to snuff. The nose is clumsy and jammy, while the fruit is underdeveloped and dull. Acceptable on its best day.",Crianza,81,10,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Viña Sardasol
114965,Spain,"Stylish and alluring nose; quite sexy. The malolactic fermentation took place in barrel, so the wine has mouthfeel and richness. Yet it's a juicy, friendly, fruit-forward style of Tempranillo, one that finishes with mocha and wood-driven spice notes. 20,000 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Allende,90,30,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Finca Allende
114989,Spain,"Earthy and fully ripe, with classic Rioja aromas of sweet leather, herbs and a touch of raisin.

Drink now through 2008.",Reserva,90,29,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Consejo de la Alta
115028,Spain,"Plenty of white flowers and tropical-fruit aromas signal that this is special.

115032,Spain,"Round, fruity and quite exceptional in its class.

Stands out from the crowd.",José Pariente,91,17,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Dos Victorias
115040,Spain,"Treixadura-based, with Godello, Loureira and tiny portions of Albariño, Torrontes, Caino Blanca and Albilla.

115057,Spain,"A recommended entry-level Ribera, with aromas of violets, minerals and oak.

115070,Spain,"Aromas of black fruits, light oak and violets are good but basic, and that pretty much defines the rest of the wine.

115146,Spain,"A blend of Cabernet, Merlot and Grenache that can only be described as strange. The nose is stewy, the palate full of root beer, baked berries and syrup.

115264,Spain,"Fresh as can be, with pure aromas of nectarine and cherry blossoms. The palate is light but refreshing and lithe, with semisweet, punchy flavors of orange, peach and pith.

115284,Spain,"A Priorat blend made in a softer, more simple style.

Plump and broad, with good depth.",Isaral,87,46,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Prior Pons
115288,Spain,"Good for a mature wine but it does smell a bit flat and damp. That murkiness blows off somewhat, leaving a solid, aged Rioja wine with acidic zap and lightly baked berry, cherry, tomato and spice flavors. Mild on the finish. Drink now.",Gran Reserva,87,40,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Ramirez de la Piscina
115289,Spain,"Earthy smelling, with slightly murky baked berry aromas. The palate is juicy and snappy, with strawberry and raspberry flavors that carry a bit of richness.

115294,Spain,"In the past we've found this wine to be a bit flat and overwooded, but the '04 is balanced, fresh and downright lovely.

115297,Spain,"A small portion of the wine went through malolactic fermentation, so it offers a lovely roundness. Features floral aromas backed by pure tangerine and nectarine flavors. Registers more fruity and smooth than mineral, with a perfect finish.",NA,91,22,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Pazo de Señorans

115327,Spain,"Two vintages running this is good, even-flowing rosé. The color is on the red side, but the nose dials in on fluffy red-berry aromas.

115333,Spain,"Initially it smells a bit cheesy and drawn, but with time it evolves to show plum, raspberry and tire rubber aromas. In the mouth, it's tight, fresh and a little gritty, with red-fruit flavors of cherry and raspberry. Not overly generous in terms of mouthfeel, but it does push the fruit until the final bell. More of a food wine than a solo sipper.",Reserva,86,12,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Malumbres
115336,Spain,"Opens with marshmallow-like sweetness on the nose, but that changes to lean fruit and saline with time. The palate is solid and zesty, with standard Rioja-style plum, berry and dill flavors. It's a fresh but quiet wine, with a tight body, medium tannins and pretty good flavors. Well done but nothing unusual.",Reserva,86,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Montecillo
115338,Spain,"Ochoa usually puts out a good rosado made from Garnacha, and this vintage keeps the winery's reputation intact. It starts with fresh peachy aromas and then comes on with light berry and peach flavors. Arguably a bit candied, but perfectly good for summer quaffing.",Rosado,86,9,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Garnacha,Ochoa
115346,Spain,"Light aromas of melon, apple and pear are just fine, and the mildly chunky palate sporting apple-based flavors is good, as is the pineapple finish.

115410,Spain,"A sweet, raisiny old-vines Garnacha with candied aromas and a fat, chunky body that houses soft, short black fruit and peppery flavors. Tastes like licorice candy on the finish, which brings some heat and burn as well. An interesting Grenache that is sweet but isn't over the top in terms of ripeness.",Secastilla,87,30,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Grenache,Viñas del Vero
115426,Spain,"Rusty in color, with initial aromas of smoke, dried leaves, herbs, tobacco and subtle berry.

Dry and leafy on the finish, which indicates that now is the time to get at it.",Real de Aragón Centenaria,86,18,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Garnacha,Pagos Familia Langa
115430,Spain,"Darker and earthier than most basic Garnachas, with aromas of compost, baked earth, crusty black fruits and leather.

Toasty and solid on the finish.",Kickass,86,13,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Garnacha,El Burro
115435,Spain,"Definitely an herbal wine, with tomato, oregano, pizza sauce and savory aromas. The palate has good snap and verve to it, while the feel is on the lean side.

115509,Spain,"Opens with common berry fruit aromas as well as a medicinal, minty note. The palate has short length and definition along with bouncy medium-depth berry flavors.

115511,Spain,"Fresh berry aromas carry some spice notes, while the palate is rugged and a little hot.

Spunky and clean, with honest flavors.",Urban Ribera,86,14,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,O. Fournier
115518,Spain,"A solid but seemingly standard blend of Tempranillo, Syrah and Garnacha with berry and cherry aromas along with touches of mint and leather. The palate is woody, with spiced berry flavors and decent body and structure. Vanilla and then oak-based bitterness define the finish. A good wine but hardly a knockout.",Corpus del Muni Roble,86,20,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas del Muni
115519,Spain,"Tight and largely neutral white fruit aromas show a little apple but little more. The palate is friendly and easy, with melon as the lead flavor. Turns more citrusy and weighty on the finish, which fades fast.",Viña do Campo,86,18,Galicia,Ribeiro,NA,White Blend,Bodegas Docampo
115523,Spain,"One of the best $7 wines you'll find from Spain. The nose is bright, medicinal and floral, while the palate is loud and peppy, with sweet red fruit flavors that sport a candied coating. Fresh, tasty and simple, which is what it should be. 60% Bobal and 40% Tempranillo.",Protocolo,86,7,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Red Blend,Dominio de Eguren
115591,Spain,"Full, roasted and earthy on the nose, with only some coconut and berry aromas to sweeten things up.

Good but with some excess oak to process.",NA,86,18,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Peña Roble
115594,Spain,"Floral, spicy, semi-oaky aromas precede a tangy, fresh, higher-acid palate with snappy raspberry and red cherry flavors.

115595,Spain,"Aromas of balsam wood, dry leather, and slightly herbal berry fruit are generally appealing, while the palate has size, balance and a healthy feel to it. More woody and spicy than outright fruity, with a touch of zesty raspberry and strawberry at the core.

115607,Spain,"Aromas of fresh tomato, citrus peel and red fruits are a touch austere, but the mouth and flavors are more generous. The palate is well balanced and the flavors run sweet, ripe and chewy, with berry fruit and creamy licorice notes on the finish.

115616,Spain,"Aromas of cactus pad, green apple and jalapeño are true Verdejo, while the palate brings citrusy, melony fruit as well as chalky, minerally dryness. Tastes a bit like white grape skins, with tangerine and lemon on the finish.",NA,86,14,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Cuatro Rayas
115619,Spain,"Opens with a blast of cola and minty grass, and then comes a raisiny wave and mossy herbal notes that are typical of Navarran Merlot, which makes up 60% of this three-grape blend. Gritty in the mouth, with black cherry, licorice, herbs, raisin and lasting sweetness on the finish.",Finca la Moneda,86,40,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Red Blend,Alzania
115680,Spain,"Starts with a crusty, almost mineral top over oaky, chunky blackberry fruit. It's a standard, semiherbal, juicy red blend (75% Tempranillo) with flavors of dried cherry and mocha. Short on the finish, with a hint of vanilla and chocolate. Good overall.",Selección Especial,86,NA,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Abadia Retuerta
115688,Spain,"Light and dominated by red fruit from the nose to the palate to the finish. Along the way are edgy accents of spice, stem, citrus and dry oak. Among all the big bruisers out there today, this is more from the old school, meaning it's fresh, lithe and crisp.",Crianza,86,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Lealtanza
115691,Spain,"Starts with punchbowl aromas of berry fruit, flowery scents and candy. The palate has a good freshness to it along with snap and flavors of cherry, plum and berry. Nothing complicated here; just a juicy, fresh wine that's likable and not overpriced.",Monte Castrillo,86,14,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Finca Torremilanos
115693,Spain,"Opens with good berry fruit aromas, mineral notes and coconutty sweetness, which is followed by a plump, well-balanced palate of black fruits, plum and licorice.

115694,Spain,"On the plus side, there's a smoky, meaty set of aromas. But on the down side, there's a rubbery character reminiscent of burnt tire tread. That rubbery element passes through to the flavors, which also bring roasted berry into the fold. Rustic stuff with just enough bold berry fruit to make it worth a go.",Arderius Crianza Vendimia Seleccionada,86,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Leza García
115695,Spain,"Begins with muddled, murky, syrupy aromas of caramel and berries. The palate is more high-toned, with lemony accents to tomato, baked fruit and savory flavors. Finishes solid albeit lightly damp and bitter. Comes around with time but always seems a bit murky.",Glorioso Crianza,86,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Palacio
115696,Spain,"Roasted and mildly leafy, and then clacky and a bit tannic in the mouth. The fruit flavors are good and mostly pure as they settle on black cherry and blackberry, while the finish is jammy but short. For $8 this should not disappoint.",NA,86,8,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Capa
115698,Spain,"This new wine from the Torres group is a little heavy and baked on the nose, but once you get it onto the palate there's depth, mouthfeel and solid flavors of savory fruit, soy, rubber and dark berry.

115774,Spain,"Concentrated, willing aromas of black cherry and sweet plum are nice and friendly, while the palate is lively, juicy and a little tart for Garnacha, with an emphasis on red raspberry.

115784,Spain,"A pretty good Tempranillo-Garnacha blend with simple but fresh berry and plum aromas. The palate has snap but no overt acidic bite, while flavors of cherry and berry are slightly herbal and end with a mild buttery accent. A touch flimsy but keeps it together.",Old Vine,85,13,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Red Guitar
115794,Spain,"Standard black-cherry aromas carry a candied, vanilla-like twinge, while the feel is juicy and snappy.

Punchy and fresh overall, with good ripeness and balance.",NA,85,8,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Garnacha,Castillo de Monséran
115869,Spain,"Punchy berry aromas are floral and jumpy, and the palate is more sheering and tart than expected, but still fresh and clean. Zesty black cherry flavors are softened by buttery oak, and the finish is racy. Could use more flavor and depth along with less acidic bite.",Hito,85,20,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto Fino,Cepa 21
115871,Spain,"A better wine than the label's varietal Garnacha, so it seems as though the Tempranillo brings character and elevation. Wild berry and cherry aromas mix in citrus and spice, while the palate is fruity, with pepper and soft spice flavors. Turns a touch tart and toward cranberry the longer it's open.",Rojo Granrojo,85,9,Central Spain,Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Bodegas Navarro López
115874,Spain,"A little bit dark and crusty on the bouquet, with murky, earthy black cherry aromas that get clearer and cleaner with air. Briary plum and cherry flavors are solid if nothing else, and the finish is basically more of the same, with length. A competent wine, but that's where it ends.",NA,85,12,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,Finca Antigua
115884,Spain,"Dusty, lightly oaked berry aromas are entirely regular, while the berry driven palate is dry, drawing and oaky, with pretty good body but stand-out acidity as well. Tastes a bit woody and peppery late. A highly generic wine that makes you wonder why it costs $30.",Tríptico,85,30,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo-Shiraz,Storks' Tower
115953,Spain,"Super dense and hard as a rock, with bacon and black fruit aromas that lead straight to a saturated, chewy, tannic palate that pounds away as it delivers blackberry, coffee, licorice and other huge flavors. As big, baked and heavy as they come, with gargantuan tannins. Includes 15% Syrah in addition to Monastrell.",Cármine,85,30,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Bodegas Murtia
115974,Spain,"Smells sort of gummy and candied, with aromas of red licorice stick, raisin and raspberry jam. The palate is sizable but comes with racy acidity, thus the flavors veer toward red fruits with an herbal accent. Burns a little on the finish due to sharp acids.",Cantos de Valpiedra,85,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Finca Valpiedra
115977,Spain,"Lightly stemmy and brambly, with lean red fruit aromas, a touch of saline and red licorice candy. The palate is lean and sort of scratchy, while the flavors are suggestive of red apple skins and red plum. Tight on the finish; similar is some ways to a simple Chianti.",Crianza,85,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Rioja Vega
115979,Spain,"This is the prototype for an over-the-top, roasted, charred Tempranillo. The nose smells directly of burnt coffee, charcoal and grilled beef. It's super-chunky on the tongue, with dominating roasted black fruit flavors. It has its merits but is still too blackened for our liking.",NA,85,20,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo,Tritón
116043,Spain,"Uncomplicated and dominated by red fruit aromas and flavors. This is your everyday type of red wine that could probably be made from just about any grape or blend of grapes. Here, Tempranillo and 15% Shiraz make for a dry, mildly oaky red with freshness and little else. Fine if you're not looking for anything special.",NA,85,10,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo-Shiraz,Penascal
116046,Spain,"Opens with peppery, earthy black cherry and berry aromas, yet the palate is clacky and narrow, with high acidity and dry, limited flavors of blackberry and black cherry. Narrow as well on the finish. Middle-of-the road and respectable but hardly a head-turner.",Senda del Oro,85,18,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Vizcarra
116047,Spain,"A little herbal and minty on the nose, but at this price one can't complain too mightily. The palate smacks down with bite and acidity, while the flavors run herbal and a little stemmy, with caramel as a backdrop. Roasted and herbal but not offensive, especially at $7 a bottle.",Tintico,84,7,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo,Castillo de Monjardin
116048,Spain,"Heavy, minty and smelling of shoe polish, barrel char and black licorice. The palate is chunky but overall it has pretty good structure. Meanwhile, the flavors of raspberry and plum carry a heavy oak influence. Spice and resin, additional reflections of the oak, dominate the finish.",Selección,84,17,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Cueto
116056,Spain,"Rather barnyardy and gaseous at first, but air breathes more clarity into the nose. The palate is chunky, grabby and a little awkward, with herbal, medicinal black fruit and buttery flavors. Slight heat and burn hamper the finish.",Misterio de...,84,12,Central Spain,Uclés,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Fontana
116057,Spain,"Big and bold stuff from southern Spain with burnt, hot aromas of roasted black fruits and stems. Better on the palate, where it brings plum and berry flavors but also some heat and saline. Slightly stemmy and roasted on the finish, much like the bouquet.",Taja,84,9,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Bodegas Mähler-Besse
116130,Spain,"Dark and chunky, but also salinic and clammy smelling, with black fruit aromas sitting in front of a palate of salinic, woody, baked fruit flavors. The tannic finish is hard and edgy, and there's some heat too. Has its high and low points.",Dos,84,15,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Bodegas Murtia
116132,Spain,"Harder and more oily on the nose than desired, with white-fruit aromas that turn sharp. The palate has ample wetness and acidity, but the flavors are somewhat bitter, nutty and oily. It's also mildly bitter on the finish. Something's not quite right here, yet it doesn't seem flawed.",Zios de Lusco,84,19,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Lusco
116133,Spain,"Light to medium aromas of cherry and berry are fresh and snappy, while the palate has high acidity, light extract and crisp, almost lean flavors of cherry and red plum. A pointed but clean wine that will do well with simple foods like sliced ham or salami.",NA,84,9,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Garnacha,Manyana
116143,Spain,"A touch green smelling, with aromas of coffee grinds and earth. Tannic in the mouth, and then hollow in the middle, with green-leaning, leafy flavors of blackberry and cola. Roasted on the finish, with burnt coffee and chewy, bitter tannins.",Tinto Joven,84,13,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Abadía la Arroyada
116148,Spain,"Rubber and plum aromas are accented by cinnamon spice notes on this fuller-sized, somewhat sticky but basic Garnacha. Dark in color and slightly herbal in terms of flavors, with tart cherry and a slightly dilute feel to the finish. Basic but honest.",NA,84,9,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Garnacha,Legado Muñoz
116155,Spain,"Basa has long been one of our go-to whites from Rueda, but this vintage seems to be on the slide. The nose is oily and short, while the fruit is turning toward bitter. It still has some vitality and green fruit character, but our advice is to wait for the 2009. A blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Verdejo.",Basa,84,15,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,White Blend,Telmo Rodríguez
116156,Spain,"Light berry aromas carry a citrusy edge, while the crisp palate is lean but clean, with dry, peppery plum and cherry flavors. There's not too much body or complexity here; it's juicy, a little metallic and highly regular. 60% Tempranillo and 40% Garnacha.",NA,84,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Tempra Tantrum
116157,Spain,"Jammy smelling, with raisin and cough drop aromas. The palate maintains that jammy profile, while the flavors run creamy and short, with a lean toward strawberry and raspberry. A little grassy and green on the finish, with a final dose of candy.",Joven,84,12,Levante,Yecla,NA,Red Blend,Valle de Salinas
116227,Spain,"A bit strange smelling for Rioja in that the nose deals a mix of candied berry aromas along with stemmy, herbal, compost notes. The palate is thick and chewy, while the flavor profile includes lightly baked, creamy berry and roasted accents. Stocky and fruity but with issues.",Cortijo III Tinto,84,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Cortijo
116241,Spain,"Starts out with gassy, earthy aromas that suggest heat and barnyard, while the palate is chunky and full, with stemmy black cherry, plum and berry flavors along with coffee and chocolate accents. Delivers power and length but not much in the way of character or complexity.",Auroch,84,12,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Tribal
116244,Spain,"A mix of standard berry fruit and leafy, herbal qualities is the starting point. Next up is a tangy, acidic palate of red fruits, vanilla, acidity and ultimately some bitterness. Short and gritty on the finish. Tastes and smells like mass-market Bordeaux. A blend of 60% Tempranillo and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Rívola,84,15,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Abadia Retuerta
116317,Spain,"Hot, earthy aromas settle on leather and tomato, while the palate is gritty and tastes of dark, smoky, chunky black fruit. More tangy and angular on the finish than desirable, with limited depth. Standard stuff on its best day.",NA,83,17,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,El Arte de Vivir
116320,Spain,"Warm and smelling of menthol, cough syrup and sweet, jammy berry fruit. The palate is also fairly medicinal in terms of flavor, while the feel is a bit hard and underdeveloped. Turns more tart and herbal the more you get to know it.",Roble,83,14,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Legón
116321,Spain,"Stemmy and leathery smelling, with heat, roasted fruit and cheesy aromas. The palate is full but soupy, with roasted, baked black fruit flavors. A bit of cinnamon and spice help out the finish, but by then the wine's very average fate has been sealed.",NA,83,9,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Rioja Vega
116326,Spain,"A little burnt and leathery smelling, with stem, bramble and raspberry aromas. The palate is sheering and tight, with semisharp acidity enlivening herbal, peppery red fruit flavors. As a whole, there isn't a lot of substance here to weigh.",NA,83,9,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Garnacha,Viña Paquita
116339,Spain,"Clearly this isn't a vintage for long keeping. In fact, one of our usual favorite Ruedas is already on the downslide. The nose is chunky pineapple and the palate is dull and wayward, with flat, pithy citrus. Lacks the vibrancy José Pariente is know for. Wait for the 2009.",NA,83,23,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,José Pariente
116404,Spain,"Minty and herbal smelling, with stemmy, generic fruit aromas. The palate is sticky and creamy, while the flavors are chunky, flat and lean toward herbal berry. An oaky, syrupy wine with a mild green streak.",NA,83,17,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Colina Verde
116407,Spain,"Flat and fleshy smelling, with little zap and only soft green fruit aromas. The palate maintains some tang and citrus, while flavors of lemon and tangerine are chunky, loud and lean toward bitter on the finish.",Bajoz Ovacion,83,11,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Pagos del Rey
116413,Spain,"Pineapple aromas lead to a soft, smooth, but lifeless palate of slightly bitter melon and banana flavors. Pithy on the finish and short on pulse. Drink immediately or let it go by altogether.",Flor del Montgó,83,12,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Verdejo,Montgó
116416,Spain,"Nothing special about this blend of Tempranillo and Shiraz. In fact, it's more austere and less pleasing than the brand's basic 2007 Temp-Shiraz blend. That said, this wine shows thin raspberry flavors and a tangy, almost sour back end. Probably best with food; not real good on its own.",Selección Especial,83,12,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo-Shiraz,Penascal
116418,Spain,"Cherry and mild sawdust aromas are brought down by sharpness that is almost vinegar-like. The palate has an acceptable mouthfeel along with sweet and sour flavors of plum and berry.

116424,Spain,"Earth, rubber and chunky black fruit aromas make for a heavy, muddled nose, while the medium-sized palate is stewy and briary, with jammy flavors of red fruits and rubber. More stewed and medicinal than anything.",NA,83,8,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Infinitus
116500,Spain,"Sharp, medicinal and a little skunky to start with, and it remains acidic, tangy and hard in the mouth, with cranberry and cough medicine for flavors. Herbal and cutting on the finish. Not much to write home about.",6 Meses en Barrica,82,15,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Emina
116503,Spain,"Smells like wet cement, spearmint and light red fruits. The palate is dilute and acidic, with tangy, citrusy flavors of raspberry and cherry. Citric on the finish as well, although on the plus side you could say it's crisp and mostly fresh.",NA,82,7,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Candidato
116506,Spain,"While this wine doesn't really appeal to us, we can envision fans of Old World, leaner, more acidic wines signing on. What we see, however, is a light-bodied, high-acid wine with tart, lean raspberry and cherry skin flavors and a sour finish. Fresh for sure, but hollow and in need of more.",Paradigma,82,26,Levante,Valencia,NA,Monastrell,Nuestra Familia Bodeguera
116514,Spain,"Gassy smelling and candied on the nose, with medicinal, jumpy cherry aromas. The palate is hot and hard, with underwhelming, semisour plum and berry flavors.

116515,Spain,"Green to the point of being vegetal, with bell pepper and green bean aromas in addition to hidden berry fruit. It's grabby and tannic across the palate, while the flavors run toward green fruit and caramel. Deficient and hard as nails.",Torremilanos,82,30,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Finca Torremilanos
116517,Spain,"As in previous years, this wine just isn't that fresh and pure. The nose is briney, and the palate follows suit. There's some chunky grapefruit to ponder, but there's unavoidable pickled, vegetal notes come finishing time.",Cabernet Sauvignon,82,18,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Rosé,1+1=3
116582,Spain,"Candied on one hand but also gassy, barnyardy and less than clean and pure on the other. A basic mouthfeel is probably the high point, while flavors of underdeveloped berry fruit are more salty and leathery than anything. Fails to impress.",NA,82,9,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Bodegas Copaboca
116583,Spain,"Funky smelling and unfamiliar, with sweet, candied spice notes and strange candied cherry aromas. Vibrant and bouncy in terms of feel, but follows the nose by tasting sweet and weird. Weak on the finish as well.",Rojo Granrojo,82,9,Central Spain,Tierra de Castilla,NA,Garnacha,Bodegas Navarro López
116584,Spain,"Smells like compost, and never does that earthy, stenchiness lift. The palate is thick and muddled, with wan, dry, buttery raspberry flavors that lack direction. Finishes dry and bland, without much structure.",Roble,82,20,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Convento Oreja
116592,Spain,"Smells candied as well as burnt and stemmy. The palate is adequate on the surface but hollow in the middle, with dry, herbal raspberry flavors. Tastes more stemmy and distracted the longer you play with it. Not ready for prime time.",NA,82,10,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Merum
116598,Spain,"Dull aromas of raspberry and plum skins turn sweeter with air, but the palate is too centered on thick, creamy, generic berry flavors that turn raisiny and chunky with time. Not grabby or cloying, but even so this wine doesn't hit many high notes.",Al Muvedre Tinto Joven,82,16,Levante,Alicante,NA,Monastrell,Telmo Rodríguez
116602,Spain,"Jammy, sweet and extremely raisiny, with a nose that matches the palate. Low in acid, so low in pulse. Pruney on the finish and seemingly overripe. Not well balanced.",Stylo Old Vines,81,10,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Garnacha,Agustín Cubero
116603,Spain,"Colorful but aromatically defined by lean, green alfalfa, which doesn't portend much good. The palate is hard and underwhelming, with herbal, almost green berry fruit flavors.

116606,Spain,"Only if you enjoy very lean, ultrafresh and tart red wines will this work. It starts with simple punchbowl aromas of red grapes and berry, and then comes a skinny, tart, grating palate that's all acid and no substance. Calling it “traditional” or a “terroir” wine would only be misleading.",NA,81,13,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Torre Castillo
116608,Spain,"A weird wine in every way. The nose smells like something off the grid, with briney fruit, funky spice notes and compost. Creamy and oaky in the mouth, with herbal flavors and a dash of nutmeg and/or cardamom. Hard on the finish, and just too strange to bother with.",Campellares,81,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodega San Pedro Apóstol
116609,Spain,"A burnt, stemmy nose is an indicator of what's to some. And while the palate has an o.k. feel to it, the flavors here are bitter, herbal and burnt. A wine that lacks freshness of fruit.",Flor del Montgó,81,12,Levante,Yecla,NA,Monastrell,Montgó
116671,Spain,"Stemmy, brambly raspberry aromas lead to a scouring, light palate of snappy, sharp-tasting red cherry and plum-skin flavors. Lean to the point that it's almost sour, and overall it's stretched extremely thin.",Arderius Tinto,81,8,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Leza García
116672,Spain,"Burnt smelling at first, and tart throughout, with pie cherry and raspberry aromas and flavors. There's not much to measure here; the wine runs sour and tastes mostly of red fruit skins and citric acid. 65% Tempranillo and 35% Garnacha.",Bardosa,81,9,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Bodegas Lomablanca
116675,Spain,"Way too charred and roasted. The mouthfeel is acceptable and ranks as the best part of the wine. The rest is just a burnt, charred, overoaked mess with flavors of earthy berry, leather, peanut and resin. A poor effort that makes you wonder what the winery was thinking.",Elaboración Especial,80,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Beronia
116676,Spain,"Flat and gaseous smelling, with sulfur and no fruit to speak of. Tastes like bland nectarine and tangerine, and the body and finish are almost flabby. Borderline in terms of its acceptability.",Pindal,80,9,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo-Viura,TorresManur
116678,Spain,"Soft, chunky and fading fast, with aromas of asparagus and canned green beans. The palate is flat as a board, with vegetal flavors and bitterness on the finish. Barely worth a sip at this point in its evolution.",NA,80,15,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Aromal
116679,Spain,"If it weren't for the wine's stout color and pretty good mouthfeel, we'd sink it. The nose is green and cheesy, and the flavors are also green almost to the point of vegetal. Stemmy on the finish.",NA,80,20,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Red Blend,Finca Constancia
116682,Spain,"Heavy and definitely on the mealy side of the fence, and fighting for any semblance of balance. Pithy as well. Sadly, the citrus fruit in this wine is not that appealing.",Gotín del Risc Joven,80,15,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Godello,Abad
116683,Spain,"Quite sweaty, oily and hard, almost like an underdeveloped Verdejo or Sauvignon Blanc. The palate is also on the bitter, oily, pithy side, with only a little grapefruit and orange working their way through.",NA,80,17,Galicia,Ribeiro,NA,White Blend,Coto de Gomariz
117005,Spain,"This is showing mineral, saline, spice, peach and melon—all good signs. The palate leans toward tropical, with pineapple leading the way. With no surprises, it finishes clean and a touch fleshy. An excellent Albariño that's maturing quickly. Drink now.",Dona Rosa,90,18,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Adega Martínez Serantes
117016,Spain,"A unique take on Manzanilla Sherry, which is often light and sea-flecked but in this case is more amber, hazy and full. The nose is racy and spicy, while the palate offers dried apricots, orange peel and salt. Finishes with tang offsetting hazelnut and walnut notes. Oily, interesting and very good if you are a Sherry fan.",Manzanilla,90,10,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L.
117018,Spain,"Spicy and a little woody on the bouquet, with ripe black-fruit aromas, a speck of mineral and a touch of cough drop. This is Torres' first commercial Priorat wine, and it's not a tannic specimen, yet the raspberry and dark-fruit flavors are sound and tasty. Finishes smooth, with a beam of acidity keeping it in balance. Drink now or at any time over the next few years.",Salmos,90,32,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Torres
117025,Spain,"Dark and definitely not reserved, this is a big blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Petit Verdot that pours on the rich blackberry, cola, chocolate and smoke character. A lot of powerful new oak backs it all up, leaving espresso bitterness and mocha sweetness on the finish. A modern wine with ample lushness.",Emeritus,90,90,Central Spain,Dominio de Valdepusa,NA,Red Blend,Marques de Griñon
117029,Spain,"Overall this Callet-led blend might exceed its more oaked, richer brother known as Son Negre. Àn has a rooty, oak-driven nose with hints of herbs and tobacco, while the palate is dark and tasty, with blackberry, cherry and cured meat flavors. Finishes with pepper and a lash of leftover oak that hopefully will disappear as the wine ages. Drink now through 2012.",Àn,89,53,Spanish Islands,Vi de la Terra Illes Balears,NA,Red Blend,Ànima Negra
117067,Spain,"Garnacha is the lead in this five-grape blend, and overall it shows almost all of what's good about Catalonian wine. The nose offers sweet cherry and a whiff of hard dried cheese; the palate is racy at first and then thickens as blackberry, red licorice and fig flavors take over. A steady wine.",Selecció Vinyes Velles,89,19,Northern Spain,Emporadà-Costa Brava,NA,Red Blend,Martí Fabra
117080,Spain,"Plenty of new oak is announced via aromas of coconut, mint, vanilla and burnt toast. but offsetting that is lively berry and cola flavors. As it opens and settles in, you get a wall of fierce tannins that aren't likely to fade any time soon. So unless you have years to cellar this wine, it will likely hold onto its hard, tannic personality. Hold another three years, if possible.",Reserva Real,89,150,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Torres
117120,Spain,"This wine is made from old-vines Verdejo and it shows more minerality and intensity than something made from younger grapes. The nose has wax, mineral and citrus aromas, while the palate shows passion fruit and pineapple flavors. Grows on you nicely with structure, acidity and a smack of Rueda terroir.",Finca la Colina Cien X Cien,89,23,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Vinos Sanz
117133,Spain,"The gold tint may look imposing, and it does signal a richer-styled wine. But let this heavier, more ripe Albariño roll over your palate and you'll probably wind up liking its citrus and nectarine flavors but softer body. Finishes with apricot, kumquat and vanilla notes. An interesting wine to drink now.",Premium,89,17,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Valdumia
117180,Spain,"Mallorca gives us this ripe but intriguing mix of Mantonegro, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. The new oak on the nose is plentiful, and along with that there's asphalt and marshmallow. The palate is full with berry and plum flavors, and there's a fleshy and plump character to the finish. A worthy wine from off the beaten path.",Sió,88,31,Spanish Islands,Vi de la Terra Illes Balears,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Herederos Ribas
117183,Spain,"Ripe plum and berry aromas are on the soft and cuddly side, but have some spunk. The palate on this classic Garnacha-Craignan-Syrah blend is adequately juicy and fresh, with a basket's worth of berry flavor. And the finish is complementary and offers some chocolate as an aftertaste. Drink now and over the next two years.",Gran Sangre de Toro,88,15,Catalonia,Catalunya,NA,Red Blend,Torres
117184,Spain,"Youthful and exuberant, with a generous blend of lead pencil, molasses and plum/berry aromas. Torres got the perfect level of ripeness and balance in this favorable vintage, and thus this is probably as good a Merlot as you're ever going to see from the Penedès. It's full and just sweet enough. Drink now through 2010.",Atrium,88,16,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Merlot,Torres
117193,Spain,"Darker and a touch more stewy than the winery's less pricey old-vines effort. Airing loosens it up, but throughout it's a big, stewy wine with extracted blackberry and coffee cake flavors. The finish is equally on the rich side, with swirling toffee and coffee afternotes. It's a big wine with heft but also some chunkiness.",Masia Carreras,88,37,Northern Spain,Emporadà-Costa Brava,NA,Red Blend,Cellar Marti Fabra Carreras
117202,Spain,"Dark as night, with forceful aromas of root beer, menthol, warm earth and baked fruits. Maybe it's a bit soft and widespread given the heat of 2003, but if flesh and fruit turn you on and the lack of complexity isn't too disconcerting, it's a fine modern Syrah. Good with bacon burgers, steak off the grill, etc.",Estate Bottled,88,45,Central Spain,Dominio de Valdepusa,NA,Syrah,Marques de Griñon
117240,Spain,"Dusty black cherry and raspberry aromas are true to the variety, and the buttery quality on the palate adds weight and vanilla to the berry and cassis flavors.

Will go well with steak.",Estate Bottled,88,45,Central Spain,Dominio de Valdepusa,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon,Marques de Griñon
117248,Spain,"The earthy brick color and dry fruit aromas announce that this isn't a typical wine. The blend is Merlot, Callet and Syrah, and it hails from the island of Mallorca. The wine is a bit tough and angular, but the plum, raspberry and cherry flavors are tightly formed and fenced in by potent acidity and oak. Interesting but not for everyone.",Negre,88,27,Spanish Islands,Vi de la Terra Illes Balears,NA,Red Blend,Son Bordils
117264,Spain,"Heavily oaked and loaded down with butter and resin, this is a wine for those infatuated with the obscure. The blend is 90% Callet and 10% Fogoneu, and don't ask us to give you the history of these Mallorcan grapes. Suffice it to say that this wine is broad, a bit stewy and very different. It's not heavy like an anchor but it has its chunky shoulder pads to deal with. Only 25 cases made.",Son Negre,88,110,Spanish Islands,Vi de la Terra Illes Balears,NA,Red Blend,Ànima Negra
117315,Spain,"An austere blend of Cab Sauvignon, Syrah and Petit Verdot. There's color and power galore, but also a choppy, firm mouthfeel that guards intense cherry flavors and smoldering oak.

Will do much better with food than by itself.",Estate Bottled Summa Varietalis,87,32,Central Spain,Dominio de Valdepusa,NA,Red Blend,Marques de Griñon
117317,Spain,"Emina is a label under the Matarromera group, and this Rueda white (80% Verdejo and 20% Viura) is light, clean and a touch flowery.

117319,Spain,"This is an interesting wine that offers a nice perfume but limited flavors and complexity. So what makes it so interesting, you ask? Well, the fact that it's varietal Petit Verdot from the Duero River Valley, which is not common; that and the fact that it's a mind-boggling $200. The wine itself shows a deep color, vanilla and cocoa flavors, and a range of dark-berry flavors.

117324,Spain,"Welcome back to the classic off-dry Sherry that helped make the category's reputation. It's amber in color, with toasted almonds, citrus peel and cinnamon on the nose.

Best served on the rocks, or at least with a very good chill.",Drysack Medium,87,15,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Williams & Humbert
117371,Spain,"Starts with aromas of clove, Band-Aid and other spicy aromas. It has a minor herbal essence both on the nose and palate, which is typical of Spanish Cabernet.

117372,Spain,"Borderline exotic on the nose, with aromas of black cherry, violet and a touch of earthy leather.

117436,Spain,"Consistent with past vintages, this crianza gets it right without setting off any balloons. It starts with raspberry and cassis aromas and backs that up with slightly citrusy red-fruit flavors.

117440,Spain,"An oily, earthy wine with plenty of belt strap and dark fruit on the nose. The palate is a bit scattered, but there's ample mineral and blackberry to move it forward.

117443,Spain,"Stocky and warm, with mild baked-fruit aromas and a hint of bramble. This venerable table wine is made from 65% Garnacha and 35 Cariñena, and from 2005 it's pretty much on the money. Expect earthy, mildly brambly flavors, lively acidity and soft tannins. Good for a wide range of simple foods and appetizers.",Sangre de Toro,86,10,Catalonia,Catalunya,NA,Red Blend,Torres
117445,Spain,"A holdover from 1999, this varietal single-vineyard Cabernet offers tree bark, molasses and prune on the nose, while the palate has raspberry flavors sitting front and center, with drying tannins in support. It's a woody and grabby wine, with vanilla notes toward the end. And at eight years old, it doesn't appear as though it will improve beyond where it's at now. So drink soon.",Vinya La Scala Gran Reserva,86,55,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pago Jean Leon
117448,Spain,"Slightly warmer in style, with caramel and vanilla aromas, yet the palate runs more toward freshness, with orange and pineapple standing out.

117490,Spain,"Lots of oak gives the nose a strong coconut essence, while the flavors of baked red plum and berries bring along notes of pepper and spice.

It shows flashes of brilliance but also ruggedness and a few clumsy characteristics.",NA,86,82,Spanish Islands,Vi de la Terra Illes Balears,NA,Red Blend,Ribas de Cabrera
117493,Spain,"In accordance to what 2003 dealt out, this wine is a bit stewy and broad. It shows cola, tree bark and baked fruit on the nose, and then sweet plum and chocolate on the finish. It's not a wine for deep contemplation; drink now to enjoy its robust plumpness.",Crianza,86,25,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Campos Góticos
117499,Spain,A better effort than in previous years. This vintage has a tangy personality and no tricks up its sleeve. The pineapple and citrus flavors are solid and the finish holds onto the Verdejo's citrusy profile. Steady and clean all the way through.,NA,86,8,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Solar de la Vega
117501,Spain,"Early on the wine is dominated by buttery oak, and it's all over the nose, palate and finish. Airing settles it down, and up from the creamy underworld comes raspberry, stewed plums and chocolate. Not the thinking man's Ribera del Duero, but it gets the job done. Imported by Freixenet, USA.",Crianza,86,18,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Valdubón
117509,Spain,"This Garnacha- and Carignan-based wine offers a brilliant color and a true bouquet of graphite, mineral, char and black fruit. Thus expectations are high as you head to the palate, which turns out to be sheer, acidic and hard. Amid the scour you'll pull out plum and blackberry flavors. It gets it two-thirds right; the nose and color are there but the mouthfeel is lacking.",Finca El Puig,86,33,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Fuentes
117549,Spain,"Mineral, citrus, natural vanilla and grass aromas send this still-kicking Verdejo on its way. The palate is all about apple and citrus, and the feel is more polished than edgy. Seems as if it's flattening and losing some steam, so drink now.",NA,86,14,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Cuatro Rayas
117550,Spain,"Peach, nectarine and green pear aromas and flavors dominate this ripe-styled Verdejo-Viura blend. Typical of Rueda, it's citrusy and a zesty, but there's enough warmth and heft so that you wouldn't call it steely or stark. Drink now.",Señorio de Garci Grande Verdejo-Viura,86,10,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,White Blend,Bodegas Garci Grande
117555,Spain,"A little warmer and rounder than most. This waxy wine offers banana and melon on the nose, while the palate is just juicy and racy enough, with apple and citrus anchoring things. Finishes easy and will go well with salads and seafood.",Montesol Clásico,86,12,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,White Blend,Vinos Sanz
117562,Spain,"Sulfurous early on, and then citrus and apple blossom aromas get into the game. The palate is ripe and tropical, with melon, mango and banana flavors. With no angularity or sharpness, this is an easy wine with soft edges. Drink now before it gets even softer.",Señorio de Garci Grande,85,14,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Bodegas Garci Grande
117565,Spain,"Berry fruit, vanilla and violet aromas are friendlier than the rugged, ultrafirm palate on this Syrah-Graciano blend. With food, the wine will be a strong counterpoint and will hold its own. By itself it may slip in pleasure points; the Graciano is tight as nails and adds astringency. Imported by Möet Hennessy USA, Inc.",Caliza,85,22,Central Spain,Dominio de Valdepusa,NA,Red Blend,Marques de Griñon
117568,Spain,"Open, round and a bit rubbery, this bright-styled wine is jammy and easy to drink. It has black cherry and blueberry flavors riding on grabby tannins, and the finish is where you get some of the “roble,” meaning oak-based chocolate and vanilla notes.",Roble,85,16,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,12 Linajes
117608,Spain,"Not a bad value in the Albariño category. Alba Rosa is the second wine from Martinez Serantes, and it's yellowish in color, with a pineapple and pear nose. Solid in the mouth, with touches of apple, white peach and lime. Proper acidity keeps it fresh.",Alba Rosa,85,15,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Adega Martínez Serantes
117609,Spain,"The nose has the vintage's heavy quality, yet the palate runs toward acidic, with an emphasis on red cherry and raspberry. The more it opens, and the more the wine's tannins and acids do their thing, the tougher it gets. Food seems like a must.",Crianza,85,25,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,12 Linajes
117610,Spain,"Cantaloupe, almond candy and orange blossom make for a sweet nose. The palate seems too close to orange juice and tangerine than the apple and peach that best defines Rías Baixas. But for anyone who likes fresh, pulpy juice, it tastes perfectly good.",Granbazán Ambar,85,19,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Agro de Bazán
117619,Spain,"There's some stewed fruit weighing down this Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon blend, but for the most part it has it going on. Coffee, oak and leather aromas set up a palate of raspberry, plum and chocolate. There's a fair amount of acid for an ‘03, and that lends legs to a wine that might otherwise seem tired.",NA,85,29,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Vitis Terrarum
117629,Spain,"Smooth on the nose, with vanilla and peach aromas. It's starting to fade but if you catch it soon you'll get apple, pineapple and some pithy character on both the palate and finish. Tastes wet and easy, and not at all complicated.",NA,85,10,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,White Blend,Inspiración Pampano
117656,Spain,"Lush and full-bodied, this Tempranillo from vines more than 65 years of age handles its size gracefully, with precise flavors of blackberries and peppery spice rounded out by hints of vanilla and tobacco.",Selección Especial,89,40,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Montebaco
117670,Spain,"With its creamy oak and baked, stretched-out flavors, is it worth $110? You can decide, but the nose has that mildly cooked, heavy character that is reflective of 2003, and the palate is bland and drying as it mixes in oaky coconut and vanilla flavors. At one moment it's sharp and tangy; then it seems better. A confounding Tempranillo that doesn't excite.",Pago Negralada,84,110,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo,Abadia Retuerta
117674,Spain,"Leathery and peanutty on the nose; soon the aromas expand to baked plum and stewy berries. The palate is sturdy and tannic, but there's enough flesh and weight to the fruit that it's mostly balanced. Finishes with bacon and leather accents.",Pecunia,84,25,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Campos Góticos
117676,Spain,"Osborne can usually be counted on for consistency and traditional flavors. But this Amontillado is all over the map. The nose has some harsh chemical compounds, while the palate is salty like a handfull of peanuts. Shows flashes but tends to fall back into a realm best left alone. Imported by W. J. Deutsch & Sons.",Premium Fino Amontillado Coquinero Fino,84,16,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Osborne
117677,Spain,"Not every swing for the fences is rewarded with a home run. This wine, from a hot year, spent 22 months in oak. Thus it's a firebomb of dark, medicinal fruit mixed with root beer, lemon peel and creamy chocolate. Never does it really unfold or find a groove, and at times it's aggressive.",Parcela El Nogal,84,75,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Pago de los Capellanes
117685,Spain,"At 70% Tempranillo and only 25% Cabernet and Merlot, there's a detectable green core running through the nose and palate. Surrounding that is sizable fruit and oak, the latter of which adds dill to the fray. All in all there's enough body and soul to save the wine, but along the way it's got some issues.",Selección Especial,84,23,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Abadia Retuerta
117703,Spain,"A new take on Harveys Bristol Cream. Instead of you adding a twist of orange with the final pour, they've done it for you. But as with many infused drinks, the aromas are kind of artificial and the flavors run straight to candied and never come back. Worth a go if you like orange as a lead flavor—serve on the rocks.",Orange Apéritif,84,15,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Harveys
117713,Spain,"Verdejo and Viura comprise this mineral- and pepper-tinged wine. The palate is clean but a touch blanced out and drying. Flavors of citrus, apple and banana transform into walnut and aging cider on the finish.",Verdejo-Viura,84,11,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,White Blend,Vacceos
117716,Spain,"Heavily stewed and raisiny, almost to the point of no return. And while the wine is definitely cooked and starchy, it rallies on the palate and finish to show some decent Priorat-style richness and flavor. But let's face it, the wine is 80% baked and won't last for much longer.",Plan B,83,19,Catalonia,Terra Alta,NA,Red Blend,Celler La Bollidora
117734,Spain,"Big, bulky and struggling for balance. The alcohol is 15.5% and we can't say that it wears it well. The nose is sulfuric and smells quite a bit like spent fireworks, and after that match stick quality blows off what's left is mostly black fruit, extract, tannin and heat. 450 cases made.",Noster,83,19,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,La Perla del Priorat
117736,Spain,Simple on the nose and like biting into a green apple when you taste it. There isn't much structure or grab to the wine; it's more like a wet wash of the mouth that finishes like ginger ale. An easy game to solve; drink now.,NA,83,20,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Orballo
117754,Spain,"“Light” is misleading, because this really isn't a light fino at all. In fact, it's rather heavy and clunky, with a salty undercurrent to its lemon and nut flavors. Tastes more cooked than ideal.",Fino Light,83,15,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Harveys
117771,Spain,"Cola, cherry and mint aromas give reason for optimisim, but the palate is extraordinarily hard and acidic. Thus the flavors are of lemony citrus more than Tempranillo, and the feel is stark as nails. You can see certain positives but balance and mouthfeel aren't among them.",Prima,82,40,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Portia
117819,Spain,"In general O. Fournier gets it right, be it in Spain or Argentina. But this Ribera del Duero struggles from the outset. It's rubbery, damp and lacks clarity of fruit. And the feel is sharp and lemony, seemingly a combo of excessive oak and raw fruit. Imported by Fine Wines from Spain.",Spiga,80,29,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,O. Fournier
118203,Spain,"Candied fruit and punch bowl aromas are not what you'd call sophisticated, and the mouth pretty much follows suit with tart, rubbery raspberry fruit that comes on a bit hot and raw. Tough but with full flavor; sort of like chewing on a plum skin.",NA,84,12,Galicia,Ribeira Sacra,NA,Mencía,A Fuga
118211,Spain,"Lean, dry aromas of cherry skins and citrus lead to a competent but basic palate of raspberry and cherry flavors. Everything about this wine screams “regular,” from the tart red fruit core to the tough but fresh mouthfeel to the edgy finish.",Old Vines Crianza,84,13,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Navarro López
118214,Spain,"Vivid pink in color, with dusty, easygoing raspberry aromas. The palate is a bit soft and low in acidity, which indicates that this is the year to drink the wine...and as soon as possible. Flavors of cherry and strawberry are regular, if a touch bitter toward the finish.",Rosado,84,11,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Garnacha,Casita Mami
118218,Spain,"By no means is this the best wine from Pedrosa; it has decent red berry aromas, but what you really get is minty, forward oak. The palate has an acidic tang to it that suggests medium ripeness, while flavors of cherry tomatoes, herbs, vanilla and mint take you only so far. More barrel than substance here.",Crianza,84,NA,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Pedrosa
118220,Spain,"Minty-grassy top aromas indicate that the wine, while endowed with decent berry character, has an herbal side as well. In the mouth, it's hard, lean and compact, with tart cherry/plum flavors and a quick finish. Basic with a touch of sourness.",6 Meses en Barrica,84,12,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Melior
118227,Spain,"Opens with a blast of hot, basic red fruit that's fiery and a little pickled. The palate is lean and acidic but doesn't burn, while the cherry and red plum flavors are elementary. Inoffensive, highly regular red wine.",Rojo Granrojo,83,9,Central Spain,Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Navarro López
118272,Spain,"Just like the previous vintage, this is a melony, fresh wine with apple aromas backed by a semi-creamy palate of peach and banana. It has a soft outlook but it isn't flabby, and thus a slight finishing note of powdered sugar and vanilla frosting seems right. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd. Best Buy.",NA,86,8,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Viura,Maximo
118276,Spain,"Slightly baked and raisiny, with aromas of black currants and blackberry jam. The palate pushes some zest and kick, while the raspberry and plum flavors are best initially and then break up before a simple finish. Offers a good midlevel taste of Priorato. Imported by Fine Estates From Spain.",Classic,86,17,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Onix
118281,Spain,"An interesting white wine based on Chardonnay and Xarello. It's like Cava without the fizz, and the nose starts out dry and like Sherry before green apple and lime come into view. Tastes really dry and chalky, with mineral and apple at its core. Imported by Organic Vintners.",Chardonnay - Xarel-lo,86,15,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,White Blend,Can Vendrell
118292,Spain,"Starts with tough, almost harsh green aromas on the nose, but with time it settles on herbs and tobacco. The palate is fresh but a touch spiky and grabby, with herbal plum and berry flavors. Solid mouthfeel and length make it worthwhile even if it's herbal and slightly green tasting.",La Cantera,84,8,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Garnacha,Castillo de Monjardin
118293,Spain,"Opens with vinaigrette and balsamic notes along with leather and black fruit aromas. The palate is soft and muddled, with soupy, stewy flavors and a jagged, candied finish. Seems to struggle for balance, which is a common flaw in many Toro wines.",Carodorum Tinta de Toro Crianza,84,35,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Bodega Carmen Rodríguez
118305,Spain,"Sweet, plummy and unrefined on both the nose and palate. This is nothing more than simple juice that isn't terrible. It's grapey, sweet and tart, with an edgy bit of tang to the finish. Regular at best; subpar if you're being critical.",Peromato,83,9,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Fariña
118314,Spain,"Jammy aromas mix with grassy green notes in front of a sweet, chunky palate that offers unconvincing, generic berry flavors. Devoid of elegance and character but loaded with heft and baked fruit. A sweet, rudimentary wine.",NA,83,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Legado Muñoz
118315,Spain,"Balsamic and hard, with a briney, stemmy set of chemical-tinged black fruit aromas. The palate hits with force and noise; it's hard, tannic and unforgiving. The flavors of baked berry are rich, but the finish is grating and blazes with tannic burn.",Reserva,83,14,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Marqués de Olivara
118354,Spain,"Concentrated, willing aromas of black cherry and sweet plum are nice and friendly, while the palate is lively, juicy and a little tart for Garnacha, with an emphasis on red raspberry. The wine dries out a bit on the finish, leaving vanilla and spice. Good enough for a basic Aragonese red.",Corona d'Aragón,85,13,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Garnacha,Grandes Vinos y Viñedos
118364,Spain,"A pretty good Tempranillo-Garnacha blend with simple but fresh berry and plum aromas. The palate has snap but no overt acidic bite, while flavors of cherry and berry are slightly herbal and end with a mild buttery accent. A touch flimsy but keeps it together.",Old Vine,85,13,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Red Guitar
118374,Spain,"Standard black-cherry aromas carry a candied, vanilla-like twinge, while the feel is juicy and snappy. Flavors of sweet berries and cherry are just fine, and they come with a nod of spice and bitterness. Punchy and fresh overall, with good ripeness and balance.",NA,85,8,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Garnacha,Castillo de Monséran
118448,Spain,"Concentrated to the max, with young, closed aromas of coconut, charcoal, mint leaf, leather, hot pavement and black fruit. The palate is juvenile, full and warm, and it delivers a jolt of meaty black fruit, licorice and baking-spice flavors. Toasty late, with no shortage of structure and oak. Should age well for a decade or so.",Dalmau,93,115,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Red Blend,Marqués de Murrieta
118465,Spain,"One sniff gives you all the info needed to process this as a terrific modern Rioja. It's rich, cuddly, oaky and minty, with tons of spice and black fruit. The palate is juicier than in the past, with lively black cherry, cassis, tobacco, vanilla and mocha flavors. Yet another fine Nieta from the Eguren family. Drink now through 2018.",La Nieta,93,164,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Viñedos de Paganos
118494,Spain,"Strawberry and raspberry aromas come on with aggression, and the bouquet doesn't really evolve. The palate is crisp, snappy and high in acid, with grating red cherry and red plum flavors. Decent red fruit character throughout but not much feel or depth.",NA,83,7,Levante,Utiel-Requena,NA,Tempranillo,Finca Milena
118499,Spain,"Mint, carob and green-tinged fruit aromas precede an herbal-tasting palate with olive-influenced plum, berry and cola flavors. From down south in Spain, it shows pretty good body and an okay mouthfeel, but the flavor profile is a little funky and strange.",Castillo de Almansa Tintorera,83,10,Central Spain,Almansa,NA,Garnacha,Bodegas Piqueras
118560,Spain,"Same score as the prior year, and pretty much the same wine. It's dusty and slightly burnt in aromas and flavors, with banana, peach and pithy bitterness extending onto the finish. Mouthfeel is the best part; otherwise it struggles to make the cut.",Sauvignon Blanc-Macabeo,83,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,White Blend,Spanish Vines
118563,Spain,"Saucy and jammy initially, and then a raisiny quality takes over. Plump and thick in the mouth, but ultra jammy in terms of mouthfeel. Syrupy and raisiny flavors run the game, and in the end it weighs in as an overripe wine from one of the hottest vintages on record.",Secreto Reserva,83,30,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Mayor
118565,Spain,"Hard and earthy, with black fruit aromas that are big but closed. The palate is short, stocky and blocky, with mammoth but basic flavors that turn rubbery. Not much of a finish to speak of.",Old Vines,83,15,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,El Curato
118571,Spain,"Disappointing given Telmo Rodriguez's overall track record. Dehesa Gago 2008 is jumpy, sweaty and stemmy smelling, with weedy, burnt, acrid flavors. Green, hard and bitter on the back end, with a candied sweetness. Try as we might, we can't find the higher level in this Toro red.",Dehesa Gago,83,18,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Red Blend,Telmo Rodríguez
118574,Spain,"Fairly green, a bit oxidized and old smelling. The palate is short and choppy, with hard leftover tannins and dry, herbal fruit flavors that push up against vegetal. Sweetness re-enters the picture on the finish, but overall this is too dried up and strained to rate higher.",Señor de Cascante Gran Reserva,83,NA,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodega del Romero
118576,Spain,"Briary, herbal aromas bring hints of tomato sauce and burnt leaves to the game, while the palate is fairly innocuous in feel. Flavors of herbal berry fruit and beets are sweet and strained, while the finish hints at green herbs and dried leaves.",Old Vine,83,11,Central Spain,Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Little Chica
118579,Spain,"Leafy, dry and mature, with baked fruit and aromas of dried oregano and basil flakes. The palate has grating tannins, while the flavors are greenish and herbal, with hints of stewed berries and burnt grass. Grabby and stalky; not sure why this old three-grape blend is still on the market.",Reserva,83,25,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Ochoa
118580,Spain,"Banana and green herb aromas make for a challenging nose. The palate has verve and acidity but its flavors of dull white fruits, melon and peach are jumbled. A clumsy mishmash of a wine; 80% Macabeo (Viura) and 20% Chardonnay.",Macabeo-Chardonnay,83,10,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,White Blend,Quo
118586,Spain,"Bell pepper, green bean, green tobacco, tomato and herb aromas carry the nose toward an acid-dominated palate of tomato sauce and herbal fruit.

With 25% Cabernet, this is a small step up from Earth's 100% Tempranillo.",Made With Organic Grapes,83,13,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Earth 3.0
118626,Spain,"This wine explores the fresher, racier side of the Priorat region. Berry fruit with just the slightest hint of raisin dominates the nose and the palate. Flavors of red plum and raspberry are borderline scouring, but then the finish gives some mocha and sage to bring everything into focus. Best with food; drink now. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",NA,86,22,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Los 800
118629,Spain,"Tropical and easy to like. We don't see many white Garnachas in the U.S., but this one shows mango, melon and vanilla on the nose and the palate follows up with lychee, apple and baking spice flavors. Plump and mellow but with adequate acidity; refreshing while it's young. Drink now. Imported by Grapes of Spain. Best Buy.",Garnacha Blanca,86,11,Catalonia,Terra Alta,NA,Grenache Blanc,Las Colinas Del Ebro
118634,Spain,"Gritty, granular and a bit raisiny at first, and then more settled later on. For Monastrell this is snappy, dry and solid, with cherry, raspberry, plum and vanilla forming a standard flavor package. The finish offers a bit of chocolate cream, but overall it's basic, tannic and full, with some bite.",Crianza,86,18,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Casa de la Ermita
118659,Spain,"Punchy berry aromas are floral and jumpy, and the palate is more sheering and tart than expected, but still fresh and clean. Zesty black cherry flavors are softened by buttery oak, and the finish is racy. Could use more flavor and depth along with less acidic bite.",Hito,85,20,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto Fino,Cepa 21
118661,Spain,"A better wine than the label's varietal Garnacha, so it seems as though the Tempranillo brings character and elevation. Wild berry and cherry aromas mix in citrus and spice, while the palate is fruity, with pepper and soft spice flavors. Turns a touch tart and toward cranberry the longer it's open.",Rojo Granrojo,85,9,Central Spain,Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Bodegas Navarro López
118664,Spain,"A little bit dark and crusty on the bouquet, with murky, earthy black cherry aromas that get clearer and cleaner with air. Briary plum and cherry flavors are solid if nothing else, and the finish is basically more of the same, with length. A competent wine, but that's where it ends.",NA,85,12,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,Finca Antigua
118674,Spain,"Dusty, lightly oaked berry aromas are entirely regular, while the berry driven palate is dry, drawing and oaky, with pretty good body but stand-out acidity as well. Tastes a bit woody and peppery late. A highly generic wine that makes you wonder why it costs $30.",Tríptico,85,30,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo-Shiraz,Storks' Tower
118801,Spain,"Smells fairly burnt and dull, with earthy, stemmy aromas that are strained and tough. The palate reflects the nose with heavy, roasted, leathery plum flavors that finish with a meaty thud. Rustic and stemmy, with a low pulse.",Crianza,83,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Rioja Vega
118812,Spain,"Jammy and flat smelling, with little to no depth to the nose. The palate is snappy but there's just enough body to offset the acidity, while the flavors of red fruits are tart and regular. Dull tasting, with a fairly long finish that's unexciting.",Vertus,82,10,Levante,Utiel-Requena,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Iranzo
118829,Spain,"A green, struggling wine from front to back. The nose kicks up underripe aromas to go with distant red fruit, while the palate is edgy and prickly, with high acidity creating snappy cherry and green flavors.",Esenzia,82,9,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra del Bajo Aragón,NA,Garnacha,Bodegas y Vinos de Lécera
118878,Spain,"Hard, leathery aromas, with an intense but exceedingly tannic palate. Killer bite and raspy, with bitterness and heat. Has decent black fruit flavor but still it's tough and unrefined.",Tres,82,18,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tempranillo,Liberalia
118889,Spain,"Stemmy, pickled aromas send the fruit component to second fiddle. Tastes, smells and feels like a wine that didn't get fully ripe; the flavors are thin and light, with tea and dilute berry. Finishes same as above.",NA,82,20,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Gazur
118922,Spain,"Opens with hard, ripe, almost forced aromas, which settle with air. The palate is wiry, firm and a touch hot, with cola, raspberry and plum flavors that rattle around on a bed of racy acidity. Finishes rather lean and raw, but with honest flavors of Garnacha and Carignan, which comprise 90% of the blend. Imported by North American Beverage Group.",Etim Selección,85,15,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Red Blend,Agricola Falset-Marca
118928,Spain,"Aromatically forward, with rubbery blackberry and grilled meat aromas. When it settles it shows grapey flavors and a chewy mouthfeel. Grabby, alert and snappy on the finish; this wine doesn't lack bounce or kick.",Garnacha & Tempranillo,85,11,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Red Blend,Ochoa
118929,Spain,"Nice black cherry, cracked pepper and a slight wave of perfume make the nose attractive, while the palate is bright and a touch sharp with red-fruit flavors.

118941,Spain,"Lightly fragrant and fruity on the nose, with earth and leather to give it meaning. The palate is medium-weight, with fresh berry and cherry flavors along with finishing notes of pepper and tobacco. Rumbles along like a good, everyday, classic Rioja. A throwback in style. Imported by Palm Bay International.",Faustino V Reserva,85,22,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Faustino
118953,Spain,"Super dense and hard as a rock, with bacon and black fruit aromas that lead straight to a saturated, chewy, tannic palate that pounds away as it delivers blackberry, coffee, licorice and other huge flavors. As big, baked and heavy as they come, with gargantuan tannins. Includes 15% Syrah in addition to Monastrell.",Cármine,85,30,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Bodegas Murtia
118974,Spain,"Smells sort of gummy and candied, with aromas of red licorice stick, raisin and raspberry jam. The palate is sizable but comes with racy acidity, thus the flavors veer toward red fruits with an herbal accent. Burns a little on the finish due to sharp acids.",Cantos de Valpiedra,85,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Finca Valpiedra
118977,Spain,"Lightly stemmy and brambly, with lean red fruit aromas, a touch of saline and red licorice candy. The palate is lean and sort of scratchy, while the flavors are suggestive of red apple skins and red plum. Tight on the finish; similar is some ways to a simple Chianti.",Crianza,85,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Rioja Vega
118979,Spain,"This is the prototype for an over-the-top, roasted, charred Tempranillo. The nose smells directly of burnt coffee, charcoal and grilled beef. It's super-chunky on the tongue, with dominating roasted black fruit flavors. It has its merits but is still too blackened for our liking.",NA,85,20,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo,Tritón
119103,Spain,"Hard, pickled aromas settle on leathery and burnt after airing. The palate is jammy and sticky, with sweet, heavy, roasted, burnt-tasting black fruit flavors. Resiny as well. Tempranillo with 10% Syrah.",Picos del Montgó,82,9,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Montgó
119130,Spain,"Very strange from the start. Odd stuff, with a candied, spice-like set of aromas that go straight to sweet, dull gumdrop flavors. Feels o.k. on the palate but tastes and smells weird.",Reserva Brut,82,20,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Font I Jordana
119136,Spain,"Simple to the point of being boring. Aromas of generic white fruits don't stand out, while the palate is soft and tastes vaguely of kiwi and nectarine. Finishes flat. Similar to the 2007.",NA,82,13,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Xarel-lo,Sumarroca
119138,Spain,"Aromas of mealy melon, pineapple juice and warm radiator dust do nothing to distinguish this Viura-led white. The palate is clipped and tangy, with citrus flavors leading to a pithy, orange-peel finish.",Viura-Chardonnay,82,11,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,White Blend,No Time
119140,Spain,"Excessive green bean, green tobacco and grass on the nose put this into the “challenged” category. The palate is tart and tomatoey, with herbal raspberry flavors and a leafy, green finish. Barely registers on the pleasure meter.",Made With Organic Grapes,82,13,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo,Earth 3.0
119146,Spain,"Quite dilute, with gaseous, chemical aromas that subside with time but never really leave. The palate is dry, mulchy and briney, and dig as you might, there is never much fruit to latch onto. Too thin, even for a cool year like 2007.",Cosecha,82,15,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Peña Roble
119155,Spain,"Stemmy and green, with herbal, earthy aromas. The palate doesn't offer much besides acid, stemmy flavors and herbal notes, and there's a spot of green bitterness to the finish. Not a lot going on here; acceptable at best.",NA,82,11,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo,No Time
119157,Spain,"Hard and oily smelling, with an acrid overtone. The palate is grating and tastes of bitter, pithy citrus, while the finish is equally bitter, with grapefruit pith lasting too long. Expensive for what you get.",Clarión,82,20,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,White Blend,Viñas del Vero
119163,Spain,"Uncomplicated and dominated by red fruit aromas and flavors. This is your everyday type of red wine that could probably be made from just about any grape or blend of grapes. Here, Tempranillo and 15% Shiraz make for a dry, mildly oaky red with freshness and little else. Fine if you're not looking for anything special.",NA,85,10,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo-Shiraz,Penascal
119166,Spain,"Opens with peppery, earthy black cherry and berry aromas, yet the palate is clacky and narrow, with high acidity and dry, limited flavors of blackberry and black cherry. Narrow as well on the finish. Middle-of-the road and respectable but hardly a head-turner.",Senda del Oro,85,18,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Vizcarra
119167,Spain,"A little herbal and minty on the nose, but at this price one can't complain too mightily. The palate smacks down with bite and acidity, while the flavors run herbal and a little stemmy, with caramel as a backdrop. Roasted and herbal but not offensive, especially at $7 a bottle.",Tintico,84,7,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo,Castillo de Monjardin
119168,Spain,"Heavy, minty and smelling of shoe polish, barrel char and black licorice. The palate is chunky but overall it has pretty good structure. Meanwhile, the flavors of raspberry and plum carry a heavy oak influence. Spice and resin, additional reflections of the oak, dominate the finish.",Selección,84,17,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Cueto
119176,Spain,"Rather barnyardy and gaseous at first, but air breathes more clarity into the nose. The palate is chunky, grabby and a little awkward, with herbal, medicinal black fruit and buttery flavors. Slight heat and burn hamper the finish.",Misterio de...,84,12,Central Spain,Uclés,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Fontana
119177,Spain,"Big and bold stuff from southern Spain with burnt, hot aromas of roasted black fruits and stems. Better on the palate, where it brings plum and berry flavors but also some heat and saline. Slightly stemmy and roasted on the finish, much like the bouquet.",Taja,84,9,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Bodegas Mähler-Besse
119225,Spain,"Gritty and tough, but amid the rough tannins and bite there is red plum, licorice candy and brown sugar sweetness.

119232,Spain,"An unusual blend of Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Picapoll that hits with apple and melon aromas.

Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Abadal Blanc,85,19,Catalonia,Pla de Bages,NA,White Blend,Masies d'Avinyo
119235,Spain,"Pungent and sweaty like Verdejo, and definitely not Albariño as we know it. This Castillian white starts out strong and sweaty, like hockey gear left too long in the bag. But the flavors of pink grapefruit, kiwi and lime are good, and the feel is fleshy if a bit flat. Finishes pithy and citric. Imported by Frontier Wine Imports.",Albarin,85,18,Central Spain,Tierra de Castilla,NA,White Blend,Pardevalles
119239,Spain,Not for everyone but not a bad sweet wine for desserts and cheeses. The nose is hard to describe but the palate and flavors are familiar: sweet applesauce and sugared pastry along with mango and candy. Decent acidity keeps it fresh and moving forward.

119245,Spain,"Earthy, leafy compost aromas are initially evident on the nose, and while the wine has some feel issue due to an abundance of raw tannins, it eventually rounds out and delivers oily, herbal flavors of blackberry and plum. Dark and muscular, but also aggressive and beefy. Seems a little untamed for a Telmo Rodriguez wine. Imported by Vintus LLC.",Dehesa Gago,85,19,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Telmo Rodríguez
119342,Spain,"Tight on the nose, with dense aromas of black fruit, leather, dried cheese and earth.

A lively, forward style made from Tempranillo, Graciano, Garnacha and Mazuelo.",Colección Vivanco 4 Varietales,91,85,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Dinastía Vivanco
119365,Spain,"An endearing, balanced, controlled Toro with earthy aromas of blackberry jam, fine leather and mellow herbs. The palate is big, tannic and rock solid, while the flavors are perfectly approachable, sweet and tilt toward chocolate and blackberry. A bit creamy on the finish, with molasses and caramel. Drink now through 2013.",Juan Rojo,91,22,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Matarredonda
119400,Spain,"Lacks freshness; pickled and leathery, with heavy, bruising tannins. Dull, pounding flavors of plum and prune are short and fierce. Rough country wine.",NA,81,9,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Caño
119411,Spain,Seems like it's past its sell-by date. Smells musky and tastes sweet and gummy. Candied papaya and mango is about all you get. Low-pulse stuff.,NA,80,12,Catalonia,Alella,NA,Pansa Blanca,Marqués de Alella
119415,Spain,"Vanilla wafer aromas leave this taster lost. The longer it airs out, the more weird the wine gets. Milk chocolate, vanilla and marshmallow dominate everything from aromas to feel to flavor to finish. A barrel-fermented rosé from Ribera Del Duero: why?",Rosado,80,13,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Rosé,Prado Rey
119417,Spain,"Probably not to everyone's liking, but this oak-fermented Verdejo is a bit like Burgundy and/or white Bordeaux. Cured meat, match stick and pineapple-lemon aromas work their way onto the mildly oaky nose, while the palate has a vanilla-based lushness that works well. Rich, opulent and classy. A sincere food wine.",Hermanos Lurton Cuesta de Oro,91,35,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,J. & F. Lurton
119418,Spain,"Grapefruit, melon, lime and match stick aromas give this Rueda a solid opening.

Simple and clean on the finish.",Hermanos Lurton,87,15,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,J. & F. Lurton
119438,Spain,"Clean as polished glass, with touches of red plum and cherry on the nose. The palate is fresh and balanced, but basic and moderate in terms of flavors.

119442,Spain,"If basic Argentinean Torrontés is to your liking, so will this be. It's fresh and green on the nose, with melon and lychee aromas. Those fruits carry onto the palate, where lemon-lime and crystallized mango flavors are sweet but crisped up by snappy acidity. Serve chilled. Imported by Frontier Wine Imports.",Viura & Chardonnay,85,11,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,White Blend,Ochoa
119451,Spain,"Big and baked, with aromas of cheese and leather offsetting sweet black fruit.

119453,Spain,"Aromas of barrel spice and grilled pineapple are solid, while the palate is thick and creamy with orange marmalade and banana flavors. If you like a thick, unctuous Chard with a glob of oak, this is it. Has its strong points but tastes too much like cinnamon stick and wood. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",Vinya Gigi,84,24,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Chardonnay,Jean León
119456,Spain,"Spice and leather aromas are positive while the smells of burnt leaves and green herbs aren't too appealing.

And the finish evaporates fast, leaving heat and medicinal notes.",Proyecto Cu4ro,84,12,Catalonia,Catalunya,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Concavins
119457,Spain,"Minty smelling, with herbal red fruit and rhubarb scents. The wine is clack, clack, clack on the palate as acids and snappy red fruit draw everything down to the base level. Flavors of raspberry and light vanilla are clean but high-toned, and there's an undercurrent of tomato. A tough wine from a vintage to forget.",Reserva,84,25,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Casa de la Ermita
119459,Spain,"A touch green and grassy at the start, with cinnamon, cherry candy and red-fruit aromas.

119469,Spain,"Jammy smelling but also lean and minty. The palate is almost sour, a bit better later on, but never does it rise above tight, lean and tart. Mesache means youthful but youth is wasted on the young in this case. Garnacha, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and the indigenous Parraleta.",Mesache,81,11,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Pirineos
119550,Spain,"Dark and chunky, but also salinic and clammy smelling, with black fruit aromas sitting in front of a palate of salinic, woody, baked fruit flavors.

119552,Spain,"Harder and more oily on the nose than desired, with white-fruit aromas that turn sharp. The palate has ample wetness and acidity, but the flavors are somewhat bitter, nutty and oily. It's also mildly bitter on the finish. Something's not quite right here, yet it doesn't seem flawed.",Zios de Lusco,84,19,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Lusco
119553,Spain,"Light to medium aromas of cherry and berry are fresh and snappy, while the palate has high acidity, light extract and crisp, almost lean flavors of cherry and red plum.

119563,Spain,"A touch green smelling, with aromas of coffee grinds and earth. Tannic in the mouth, and then hollow in the middle, with green-leaning, leafy flavors of blackberry and cola.

Basic but honest.",NA,84,9,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Garnacha,Legado Muñoz
119575,Spain,"Basa has long been one of our go-to whites from Rueda, but this vintage seems to be on the slide. The nose is oily and short, while the fruit is turning toward bitter.

119576,Spain,"Light berry aromas carry a citrusy edge, while the crisp palate is lean but clean, with dry, peppery plum and cherry flavors.

119733,Spain,"Definitely sweet, syrupy and raisiny. Torres has made a chunky, plodding wine with saturated berry and plum flavors but hardly any of the mineral, schist, zest and excitement the Priorat is renowned for. Deep, dark and dense for sure, but ultimately flabby and mediocre. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",Salmos,84,37,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Torres
119738,Spain,"Stretched on the nose, with reedy, wiry, candied red-fruit aromas. Quite tannic and a bit syrupy in the mouth, with ultrasweet berry flavors and then a scratchy, forward finish. Has its merits but seems out of place and pushy for Spain. Imported by Classic Wines, Inc.",Hacienda,84,14,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon,Casa del Valle
119746,Spain,"A decent old-school throwback, with dried spice, pepper and slight red-fruit aromas followed by a light-bodied palate of plum and raspberry. While it's mostly lean, there is the smallest note of caramel and toffee to the finish. Drink now.",Tierra Serena,84,10,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,Artiga Fustel
119753,Spain,"A fleshy, simple wine with gumball aromas. The palate is chubby but not all that structured, with plump but basic berry and plum flavors. The finish shows some blackberry but not much else. Good and generally clean, but rudimentary. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",Crianza,84,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,CVNE
119754,Spain,"Starts out pretty good and fruity, but becomes more challenged with time. There's a truckload of early raspberry fruit, but it turns more sharp and piercing the more time it sits. Lengthy and potent, but not elevated.",NA,84,12,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon,Finca Antigua
119755,Spain,"Sweet and syrupy, with molasses on the nose. On one hand it's rich, ripe and flavorful, but also cooked, lumpy and heavy.

119827,Spain,"A bit strange smelling for Rioja in that the nose deals a mix of candied berry aromas along with stemmy, herbal, compost notes. The palate is thick and chewy, while the flavor profile includes lightly baked, creamy berry and roasted accents. Stocky and fruity but with issues.",Cortijo III Tinto,84,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Cortijo
119841,Spain,"Starts out with gassy, earthy aromas that suggest heat and barnyard, while the palate is chunky and full, with stemmy black cherry, plum and berry flavors along with coffee and chocolate accents. Delivers power and length but not much in the way of character or complexity.",Auroch,84,12,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Tribal
119844,Spain,"A mix of standard berry fruit and leafy, herbal qualities is the starting point. Next up is a tangy, acidic palate of red fruits, vanilla, acidity and ultimately some bitterness. Short and gritty on the finish. Tastes and smells like mass-market Bordeaux. A blend of 60% Tempranillo and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Rívola,84,15,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Abadia Retuerta

119961,Spain,"Ripe, dense and powerful, with on onslaught of raisin, spice, pepper and leather on the nose.

120030,Spain,"A slightly murky and chemical-smelling wine with a nose of rubber band, beets, red fruits and licorice. It's sweet and roasted in the mouth, with molasses and raisin flavors.

120034,Spain,"Nobody ever said Yecla in southern Spain is Sauvignon Blanc country, but here is proof that the grape does exist there.

120058,Spain,"Rather baked and heavy, with chunky black fruit and chocolate on the nose. First in line on the palate is raisin and prune, while in back of that there's vanilla, dill and brown sugar.

120071,Spain,"Stemmy and leathery smelling, with heat, roasted fruit and cheesy aromas. The palate is full but soupy, with roasted, baked black fruit flavors.

120210,Spain,"The previous two years we did not find this wine to be worthy of a rating. This time, we rate it but note that it's an almost-red wine made from Cabernet Sauvignon.

120414,Spain,"Earth, rubber and chunky black fruit aromas make for a heavy, muddled nose, while the medium-sized palate is stewy and briary, with jammy flavors of red fruits and rubber. More stewed and medicinal than anything.",NA,83,8,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Infinitus
120462,Spain,"Pungent up front, with dry bayberry, leather, jam notes and schisty minerality. The palate is all about structure, snappy acids, sinewy tannins and lively, full-force red-fruit and plum flavors. Like in the past, this is a top-notch Priorato that holds its form through the acid-driven finish. Best from 2011–2015.",Les Eres Vinyes Velles,93,66,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Joan Simó
120476,Spain,"With spice, raisin and driving dark-fruit aromas, this sweetie is lifted and enticing on the bouquet. Big, rowdy and complex in the mouth, with layered cherry, cough drop and kirsch flavors. Very pure late, with coffee, chocolate and even more spice to the finish. Shows good fruit, acids, heft and overall balance. Delicious and highly recommended.",Ètim Verema Sobremadurada Old Vines Late Harvest 375ml,92,28,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Red Blend,Agricola Falset-Marca
120565,Spain,"Lower in price than Cenit's Old Vines, but to me this is a better, more open wine with bacon, spice and bold black-fruit aromas. The palate is full but retains finesse as well as big tannins; flavors of black fruits come with chocolate, coffee and spice. Full-force stuff but still fairly refined. Drink now through 2014.",Demora,92,30,Northern Spain,Tierra del Viños de Zamora,NA,Tempranillo,Viñas del Cenit
120567,Spain,"Dark, condensed and inky, with big, muscular aromas of charcoal, cassis liqueur, blackberry and tar. The palate is just lush enough despite being staunch and tannic, and the flavors of black fruit and cassis are luscious and sweet, with a bit of lemony oak adding zest. Drink from 2011 through 2015.",Termanthia,92,200,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Numanthia
120602,Spain,"The wine's tan-gold color tells you that it's fading, the aromas of canned pineapple are not particularly fresh, and the finish is fleshy and fat. Imported by Alconde Vineyards, LLC.",Tres Villas,83,16,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Bodegas Alconde
120609,Spain,"Best early and then it shows its lesser pedigree later on. Early aromas of ripe berry fruit aren't bad before they shift to measurably jumpy and edgy. There's black cherry candy flavors and then snap, crackle and pop on the tongue. Good for the price.",Opera Prima,83,6,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,J. Garcia Carrion
120610,Spain,"Seems sort of waxy and baked, with mildly acrid aromas of burnt corn leading the way. The palate has an o.k. feel but the flavors are rather bitter and burnt, and the fruit isn't pointed or expressive. May already be past its prime. Imported by Winery Exchange.",NA,83,9,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Verdejo,Tienen Duende
120611,Spain,"Opens with dried red fruit and cinnamon aromas, but after that the mouth is creamy and grabby, with bland fruit and then a wave of vanilla cream and milk chocolate on the finish. A sticky wine that doesn't fully pass the balance test.",Gran Reserva,83,15,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Viña Albali
120616,Spain,"Not bad on the nose, where strawberry and cream aromas are doused a bit by a burnt-field smell. In the mouth, it's snappy and elastic, with tart flavors of apple, underripe nectarine and grapefruit. Finishes lean and crisp, without much personality. Imported by Testa Wines Of The World.",NA,83,12,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Rosé,Recorba
120619,Spain,"Pleasant but very basic, with a nose of dry cherry and a palate that's crisp, lean and features flavors of tart plum and cherry. A decidedly crisp and lean style of Rioja, with no richness to speak of save for a hint of butter on the finish. Imported by Classic Wines, Inc.",Añares Crianza,83,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Olarra
120620,Spain,"Starts out on shaky ground with coconut and chemical aromas. In the mouth, it hits very hard with cola, raisin and cherry flavors. Falls flat and empty on the finish, and as a whole it seems overdone. Seems like a novelty, and at $36 it fails to impress.",NA,83,36,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Petite Verdot,Casa de la Ermita
120622,Spain,"Roll out the barrel, or the staves, or the oak dust, or whatever it is that gives this modest Chardonnay such an overpowering wood element. Amid all the toast and burnt popcorn there's honey, butter, baked white fruits and pretty good core acidity. Imported by JNJ International Inc.",Veleta,83,9,Andalucia,Vino de la Tierra Contraviesa Alpujarra,NA,Chardonnay,Dominio Buenavista
120623,Spain,"Stemmy and rough out of the blocks, with aromas of rubber and strawberry. Seems grabby in the mouth due to rather rough tannins and high acidity, and overall the wine seems forced but lacking in the essentials. Quite expensive given the result. Imported by Frontier Wine Imports.",Reserva,83,46,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Heras Cordon
120629,Spain,"With tobacco, licorice, herbs, bell pepper and carob, there's a bit of everything to this Navarran Cabernet. The palate is thick and chewy, but it's also sticky and very tannic. Flavors run toward vegetal and green, with clove, burnt sugar and roasted fruit. Heat and molasses work the finish of this beefy beast that lacks clarity.",Palacio de Otazu Altar,83,54,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Cabernet Blend,Otazu
120670,Spain,"Sharp, medicinal and a little skunky to start with, and it remains acidic, tangy and hard in the mouth, with cranberry and cough medicine for flavors. Herbal and cutting on the finish. Not much to write home about.",6 Meses en Barrica,82,15,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Emina
120673,Spain,"Smells like wet cement, spearmint and light red fruits. The palate is dilute and acidic, with tangy, citrusy flavors of raspberry and cherry. Citric on the finish as well, although on the plus side you could say it's crisp and mostly fresh.",NA,82,7,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Candidato
120676,Spain,"While this wine doesn't really appeal to us, we can envision fans of Old World, leaner, more acidic wines signing on. What we see, however, is a light-bodied, high-acid wine with tart, lean raspberry and cherry skin flavors and a sour finish. Fresh for sure, but hollow and in need of more.",Paradigma,82,26,Levante,Valencia,NA,Monastrell,Nuestra Familia Bodeguera
120684,Spain,"Gassy smelling and candied on the nose, with medicinal, jumpy cherry aromas. The palate is hot and hard, with underwhelming, semisour plum and berry flavors.

120685,Spain,"Green to the point of being vegetal, with bell pepper and green bean aromas in addition to hidden berry fruit. It's grabby and tannic across the palate, while the flavors run toward green fruit and caramel. Deficient and hard as nails.",Torremilanos,82,30,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Finca Torremilanos
120687,Spain,"As in previous years, this wine just isn't that fresh and pure. The nose is briney, and the palate follows suit. There's some chunky grapefruit to ponder, but there's unavoidable pickled, vegetal notes come finishing time.",Cabernet Sauvignon,82,18,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Rosé,1+1=3
120761,Spain,"Tight, pure and just right from start to finish. The nose offers bold berry, roasted plum, vanilla and spice aromas along with exceptional clarity, and the palate is snappy and pure but also dark and loaded with coffee, chocolate, mocha and fine raspberry and cherry flavors. Slightly oaky but smooth late, and composed. Drink now through 2014.",Fincas de Ganuza Reserva,92,49,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Remírez de Ganuza
120775,Spain,"A little heavy at first, but airing reveals a robust and stirring bouquet of plum and berry aromas mixed with coffee and leather. The palate is pure and deep, with a lush set of blackberry, ripe plum and berry syrup flavors. Shows a fine structure, a long and warm finish, and the potential to age another 5–8 years.",Sentius,92,33,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Joan Simó
120850,Spain,"Golden brown in color, with smooth, almondy aromas along with apricot, cinnamon and toffee. The palate is full, round, smooth and satisfying, with a fine blend of weight, acidity and prime Sherry flavors.

120868,Spain,"Mature, classy and different than most, with earth, tobacco, warm fruit, baked notes and subtlety to the bouquet. The palate is whole, welcoming and full of baked plum, spice, molasses and leathery, and then it finish long and complex, but a little sweet and rooty. A winner from Mallorca for those seeking something different. Drink now.",Àn,91,55,Spanish Islands,Vi de la Terra Illes Balears,NA,Red Blend,Ànima Negra
120932,Spain,"A mixture of tomato, jammy red fruit, alcohol and grit gives this four-grape, Garnacha-led blend a tough path to hoe. In the mouth, the fruit is shrill as it settles on raspberry and cherry, while the feel and length are short. Hits the palate then it's gone in a flash.",Garnacha & smc,83,17,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Red Blend,Viladellops
120933,Spain,"With basic pear, green melon and other sweet aromas, the nose is controlled. But the palate on this white Garnacha is dry and soda-like, with seltzer-like flavors touched up by citrus. Decent but bland. Imported by Frontier Wine Imports.",Menguante Garnacha Blanca,83,20,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Garnacha,Viñedos y Bodegas Pablo
120934,Spain,"Standard berry along with warm, earthy aromas give it some size, and the palate shows medium-bodied raspberry and strawberry flavors.

120936,Spain,"Modest fruit aromas and a touch earthy and burnt smelling, with lively, somewhat tart raspberry and plum flavors.

120937,Spain,"Rhubarb and brambly black cherry aromas set up sweet, candied, fairly forced red-berry flavors that have a green element and a slightly cloying feel.

120940,Spain,"Neutral smelling, with a hint of pool water to the nose. The palate delivers a strange combination of mustard and white grapefruit, and the finish is pithy to the extreme and mildly bitter. The blend is the uncommon mix of Sauvignon Blanc and Macabeo (Viura).

120941,Spain,"Aromas of strawberry, cassis and mocha are brought down a notch by vegetal notes, while the palate is heavier than the winery's straight-ahead Tempranillo.

120948,Spain,"Same score as the prior vintage, and pretty much the same tart wine. It's red in color, sweet and candied on the nose, and awkward in general.

Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Monte Castrillo Rosado,82,14,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Finca Torremilanos
120953,Spain,"Seems like the hot sun of central Spain got to this three-grape blend because it's undeniably sweet and baked. The aromas are pure raisin, while the palate is drawn down and syrupy. Too thick and sweet for its own good.",Crianza,82,18,Central Spain,Manchuela,NA,Red Blend,Vega Tolosa
120958,Spain,"Starts with pine, saline and berry candy aromas and it settles on sweet and jumpy. Juicy as can be and very lively, but also short, choppy, sweet and with a bubble gum character.",Opera Prima,82,6,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon,J. Garcia Carrion
120962,Spain,"Candied on one hand but also gassy, barnyardy and less than clean and pure on the other.

Fails to impress.",NA,82,9,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Bodegas Copaboca
120963,Spain,"Funky smelling and unfamiliar, with sweet, candied spice notes and strange candied cherry aromas. Vibrant and bouncy in terms of feel, but follows the nose by tasting sweet and weird. Weak on the finish as well.",Rojo Granrojo,82,9,Central Spain,Tierra de Castilla,NA,Garnacha,Bodegas Navarro López
120964,Spain,"Smells like compost, and never does that earthy, stenchiness lift. The palate is thick and muddled, with wan, dry, buttery raspberry flavors that lack direction. Finishes dry and bland, without much structure.",Roble,82,20,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Convento Oreja
120972,Spain,"Smells candied as well as burnt and stemmy. The palate is adequate on the surface but hollow in the middle, with dry, herbal raspberry flavors. Tastes more stemmy and distracted the longer you play with it. Not ready for prime time.",NA,82,10,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Merum
120978,Spain,"Dull aromas of raspberry and plum skins turn sweeter with air, but the palate is too centered on thick, creamy, generic berry flavors that turn raisiny and chunky with time.

120982,Spain,"Jammy, sweet and extremely raisiny, with a nose that matches the palate. Low in acid, so low in pulse. Pruney on the finish and seemingly overripe. Not well balanced.",Stylo Old Vines,81,10,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Garnacha,Agustín Cubero
120983,Spain,"Colorful but aromatically defined by lean, green alfalfa, which doesn't portend much good. The palate is hard and underwhelming, with herbal, almost green berry fruit flavors.

120986,Spain,"Only if you enjoy very lean, ultrafresh and tart red wines will this work. It starts with simple punchbowl aromas of red grapes and berry, and then comes a skinny, tart, grating palate that's all acid and no substance. Calling it “traditional” or a “terroir” wine would only be misleading.",NA,81,13,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Torre Castillo
120988,Spain,"A weird wine in every way. The nose smells like something off the grid, with briney fruit, funky spice notes and compost.

121077,Spain,"Smells slightly exotic and different from the norm; the nose offers baked black-fruit scents, lemon peel, rubber and Eastern spices.

121216,Spain,"Thin and saline on the nose, with a chemical-chlorine smell. The palate is fairly sour and raw, with tough tannins and a killer grip.

121219,Spain,Decent aromas but overly acidic and astringent. The cherry flavor is so sour that any vanilla or oak that may come on late can't save the day. Imported by Baron Francois Ltd.,Reserva,81,26,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Viña Ijalba
121220,Spain,"Lacquer and apple cider aromas lead to a sticky, sweet palate. There's a citric edge to it but mostly it's just sweet and tastes like orange slices and jelly beans. Imported by CIV/USA.",Opera Prima,81,6,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Chardonnay,J. Garcia Carrion
121223,Spain,"Red licorice candy on the nose is the only sign of life. Otherwise it's just sour and dried-out, with flavors of citrus and plum skins. Past its prime.",Gran Reserva,80,15,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Gran Oristan

121229,Spain,"Has some serious cleanliness issues on the nose, and while it's not entirely unpalatable, it does struggle to make many positive statements.

121292,Spain,"Burnt smelling at first, and tart throughout, with pie cherry and raspberry aromas and flavors.

121295,Spain,"Way too charred and roasted. The mouthfeel is acceptable and ranks as the best part of the wine. The rest is just a burnt, charred, overoaked mess with flavors of earthy berry, leather, peanut and resin. A poor effort that makes you wonder what the winery was thinking.",Elaboración Especial,80,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Beronia
121296,Spain,"Flat and gaseous smelling, with sulfur and no fruit to speak of. Tastes like bland nectarine and tangerine, and the body and finish are almost flabby. Borderline in terms of its acceptability.",Pindal,80,9,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo-Viura,TorresManur
121298,Spain,"Soft, chunky and fading fast, with aromas of asparagus and canned green beans. The palate is flat as a board, with vegetal flavors and bitterness on the finish. Barely worth a sip at this point in its evolution.",NA,80,15,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Aromal
121299,Spain,"If it weren't for the wine's stout color and pretty good mouthfeel, we'd sink it. The nose is green and cheesy, and the flavors are also green almost to the point of vegetal. Stemmy on the finish.",NA,80,20,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Red Blend,Finca Constancia
121302,Spain,"Heavy and definitely on the mealy side of the fence, and fighting for any semblance of balance. Pithy as well. Sadly, the citrus fruit in this wine is not that appealing.",Gotín del Risc Joven,80,15,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Godello,Abad

121501,Spain,"Reasonably fresh on the nose, but ultranarrow and tart in the mouth. In fact, it's borderline sour in the way it presents such linear red fruit. Tight as a drum and sheering.

122027,Spain,"Rooty, warm and leathery at first, and then it really rounds into form. This Garnacha-led multigrape blend is a pretty, earthy, stylish wine that's at peak maturity. It brings baked, rich black cherry, cola and toffee flavors and then a finish of coffee and toast. A bit syrupy but still excellent and ready now.",Selecció Vinyes Velles,90,23,Northern Spain,Empordà,NA,Red Blend,Martí Fabra
122031,Spain,"White pear, melon and almond skin aromas are good and correct, while the peachy palate has roundness and interesting flavors of orange, lime and nectarine. Crisp, precise and well-glued together, with harmony throughout. A textbook food-friendly white that's more interesting than other Rías Baixas wines due to the addition of Loureira and Caiño Blanco to traditional Albariño.",O Rosal,90,24,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,White Blend,Terras Gauda
122033,Spain,"Roasted and baked on first blush, but then the wine's complexity and use of unusual Mallorcan grape varieties take over. Along the way there's flavors and aromas of prune, earth, leather, spice and Mediterranean terroir. It's also bringing tobacco and leaf notes to the table. A fun, different wine that goes nicely with tapas. Drink now through 2011–12.",ÀN/2,90,25,Spanish Islands,Vi de la Terra Illes Balears,NA,Red Blend,Ànima Negra
122219,Spain,"Deep and dark, with fruitcake, black fruit and chocolate aromas. The wine has vibrancy and depth, which are the keys to getting the so-called “modern formula” right. Flush and ripe in terms of mouthfeel, with black plum, bitter chocolate and fine coffee flavors on the plump finish. Drink now through 2011.",Edición Limitada,90,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Ramón Bilbao
122223,Spain,"Aromas of rubber, leafy red fruit and herbal raspberry are solid. It's crisp in the mouth, with raspy tannins supporting tight cherry and raspberry flavors. Finishes like it flows, with firm acidity and zest more than richness, leaving a hint of creamy vanilla and heat as it fades away.",Criança,87,48,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Morlanda
122224,Spain,"Muga has crafted a steely, no-fat Viura (with 10% Malvasia), despite the wine being fermented in barrel. The nose is clean and passive, while the palate is crisp and tight but largely neutral in its delivery of apple and lemon flavors. From a cool vintage, this wine is like kissing the razor's edge. Good stuff but limited in what it has in store.",Barrel Fermented,87,17,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Viura,Muga
122225,Spain,"The unheralded Tarragona D.O. delivers a basic winner in this varietal Tempranillo. It comes out of the gate well, with deep cherry, kirsch and coffee aromas. The palate falls off a touch from the promise of the bouquet, but overall the wine is generous and fruity and sincere. More balanced and complex than one might expect from a Catalonian value-priced red.",Old Vines,87,11,Catalonia,Tarragona,NA,Tempranillo,Nostrada
122232,Spain,"Citrusy on the nose, with just a hint of sulfuric burn and smoke. Flavors of sweet white grapefruit, tangerine and tarragon leaf give the palate that little bit extra, while the finish is smooth but short. Good but a touch flat on the back end and finish.",Cordon Negro Extra Dry,87,12,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
122234,Spain,"Both Freixenet and its sister property Segura Viudas put out myriad Cavas in this price and quality range. This one shows cherry candy on the nose and some seltzer. The palate is balanced between sweet red fruit and citrus, while the finish is dry despite some earlier sweetness. Bouncy and nice for a Pinot Noir Cava.",Aria Brut,87,12,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Pinot Noir,Segura Viudas
122249,Spain,"Nothing outrageous but this Garnacha, which now has a little age on it, is more than satisfying. The nose delivers cherry, plum and even a little cookie, while the savory palate features molasses, plum and spice. Subtle, composed and sort of old-school. Drink now.",Selección Reserva,87,18,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Garnacha,Bodegas Alconde
122326,Spain,"Pure and forward, with minerally aromas of citrus, grapefruit and wet stone. For basic Verdejo, this is head and shoulders above most; it bursts with fresh orange, grapefruit, green apple and peach, and the finish is pure and long. So tasty and super easy to like; a highly recommended go-to value white.",NA,90,15,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Naia
122502,Spain,"A smoky number with vibrant aromas of dried fruits mixed with campfire and molasses. It's integrated and spicy, with cherry, apple-peel and other attractive secondary flavors. With no shortage of power and fine tannins, this wine is approaching its peak and should be good for another five years.",Reserva,90,34,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Campillo
122512,Spain,"Not many wines of this price are pulling legit 90-point scores. But this one deserves it. The wine delivers citrus and piquant green-fruit aromas, which are backed by honeyed melon and lime flavors. The texture is just soft enough to not bite, while the finish is wavy. 10,000 cases made.",NA,90,11,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Valdelainos
122586,Spain,"Rubbery, meaty and fully ripe smelling: that's the nose on this round and dark Monastrell. Yet while it hints at being bold and burly, the palate is more restrained and subtle. Don't expect a ton of stuffing, and instead look for savory plum and olive flavors in front of a short, stout finish. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",NA,86,14,Levante,Yecla,NA,Monastrell,Castillo del Barón
122590,Spain,"There's nothing not to like about this affordable Spanish bubbly. The nose is a little candied and shy, but it's pleasant overall. The palate foams a bit more than a stately Cava might, but the flavors of pear, apple and grapefruit are honest. Fresh yet soft, simple and easygoing.",Carta Nevada Brut,86,9,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
122592,Spain,"Good but basic wine from southern Spain that shows cherry aromas with a citrusy twist. The mix is Monastrell with Syrah and Tempranillo, and as a whole it is composed, with berry, plum and other straightforward flavors. A plump, friendly sort of wine that isn't too complicated.",NA,86,12,Levante,Yecla,NA,Red Blend,Altos del Cuco
122593,Spain,"Campo de Borja's “everyman's” red rides again in 2007. Sure, it's sweet and candied, but that's the 75% Garnacha talking. Flavors of berry, plum and chocolate are bold and forward, though not very complex. Seems more lush and heavy than in the past. Good for those who don't want to think much about what they're drinking.",NA,86,8,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Red Blend,Borsao
122603,Spain,"Slightly more chunky and dusty than lively, with dry apple aromas and not much else. The palate offers a medium level of intensity and flavors of melon, banana and white pepper. Turns drier and more soda-like on the finish. Good but a little short on flavor.",NA,86,17,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Dom Bardo
122604,Spain,"A little cloudy and minty, with aromas of herbs and reeds bumping up against cherry cough drop. That medicinal cherry flavor joins plum and light pepper, while the feel is lively, bracing and forward. Gets better with airing, and overall it tastes a little more natural than some Jumilla heavyweights.",Monasterio de Santa Ana,86,12,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Casa de la Ermita
122605,Spain,"Stylistically speaking, this oak-aged wine is very different from all of Borsao's fruit-first Garnachas. And that isn't exactly a full-out compliment. So while the wine has balance and structure, the oak seems dominant on the nose and palate, which lends more vanilla and cream than spice and character.",Crianza Selección,86,16,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Red Blend,Borsao
122606,Spain,"Quintessential value wine from Spain is what you're getting with Viña Borgia's 100% Garnacha. The nose is candied for sure, but it settles to show the upside of Grenache rather than the weaker, more remedial side. Flavors of bright cherry and raspberry are high-toned and pure, and the finish offers a little pepper and edge.",Viña Borgia,86,6,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Borsao
122638,Spain,"A tough, sun-belted wine with concentration, big tannins and a ton of power and flavor. The nose is all bacon, balsamic notes, tobacco and roasted black fruit, while the ridged palate is dark and tastes of blackberry, molasses, coconut and brown sugar. Edgy, lemony and tannic on the finish. Drink now with beef; can be held for another 3–5 years.",Cenit Old Vines,90,48,Northern Spain,Tierra del Viños de Zamora,NA,Tempranillo,Viñas del Cenit
122784,Spain,"Brawny but lovely, with monster black fruit, balsam wood, tobacco and cola nut aromas. The palate is ultra rich and modern in style, with deep, brandied flavors of cola, black cherry and spice. Driven, modern and properly tannic, with a fair amount of mocha and creaminess on the finish. Drink from late 2010 thru 2014.",Amancio,95,167,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
122892,Spain,"Ginger ale and a touch of powdered sugar give this extra dry Cava its proper sweet aromas. The flavors are solid, if you like candied orange slices and lemon-lime soda. Shows good mouthfeel and more than adequate freshness. Perfectly competent given that it's $9.",Extra Dry,86,9,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Cristalino
122895,Spain,"The bouquet delivers some of that creamy, corn-like smell that many Cavas show. There is also cereal and citrus to the nose. Flavors of nectarine, grapefruit and green herbs are fresh and in the lead, and the feel is soft-edged. Shows some green bitterness on the finish.",Brut de Bruts,86,20,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Gran Rigau
122898,Spain,"Probably not a Cava for wine snobs. But who says all wines have to be super serious and complex? This one shows cured meat, tarragon, sweet tea and Muscat aromas, while the flavors are pure lychee and honeydew. Frothy and sugary, but that's the spumante style. Best with birthday cake, etc.",Spumante,86,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
122906,Spain,"From the Freixenet group of wineries, Vionta is clean but more neutral than we'd like to see. You won't be offended by the wine's green apple and lemon flavors, which are wet, fresh and zesty. But you might like a touch more refinement and dimension. A good wine, but a basic one.",NA,86,18,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Vionta
122907,Spain,"Gets off early with fresh tomato, spiced red plum, tobacco and vanilla aromas. The palate is fine but tight, with herbal fruit flavors, pepper, tomato and sharp acidity. Finishes with olive and tomato notes. Not the sweetest or softest thing going, but good if you like Navarran wines and their patented herbal, red-fruit character.",Crianza,86,17,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo,Ochoa
122978,Spain,"Baked, earthy and leathery, just like all the AN wines. But there's also a smooth intersection of the old and new worlds here; it's one part rooty, oaky and rich but also dry, leathery and indigenous to the Balearics (the base grape is Callet). Finishes a little sweet and warm, and thus it's begging to be drunk now.",Àn,89,50,Spanish Islands,Vi de la Terra Illes Balears,NA,Red Blend,Ànima Negra
122987,Spain,"A more traditional type of crianza with vanilla, spice, dry berry fruit and a quiet, subtle approach. The mouthfeel is Old World with it's clean, dusty weight and proper acid-tannin balance, and the flavors of spice, cherry, dried currant and earth don't overstep their place. Very nice wine for under $20.",Crianza,89,17,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Valserrano
122998,Spain,"Nice, clean and vibrant, with a welcoming set of peach, apricot and citrusy aromas. The wine is 100% correct and fresh, with clarity and flavors of apple, peach and green grapes. Shows just enough body, acid and pith on the finish, but drink now before it starts to fade.",NA,89,18,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,As Laxas
123065,Spain,"Deep and dark as night, with a lake's worth of cassis and black fruit aromas. There is no interference here; just pure, big-boned, modern-style Tempranillo flavors of currants, blackberry and soft, cuddly oak. Finishes with cream and coconut, but length and power as well. Hold until late 2010 and drink through 2015.",La Nieta,95,163,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Viñedos de Paganos
123087,Spain,"Huge wine with sweetness and smooth qualities from head to toe. Aromas of mint leaf, pastry and sweet black fruits are magnetic, while the lush, layered palate is complete and packed with berry fruit, toast, fudge and tobacco flavors. Layered and deep on the finish, with cola, herbs and licorice notes. Beautiful wine. Drinkable now and good through 2013.",La Viña de Andres Romeo,94,166,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Benjamin Romeo
123169,Spain,"A slightly heavier version of Verdejo, especially given 2007's cool conditions in Rueda. The wine has waxy peach and papaya aromas follwed by apricot, pineapple and mango flavors. It definitely opens on the palate and then finishes with a fleshy texture, additional fruit and even some nuts. Good complexity yet still a forward type of white wine.",Fuente Elivra,89,14,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Pedro Escudero
123171,Spain,"Dry, smoky and showing a touch of leather, this is a smooth crianza with bright berry flavors, a bit of heft, and well-applied oak that doesn't overwhelm. Black cherry and raspberry flavors are bright, and the vanilla and butter elements are controlled and should subside in due time. Drink now into 2010.",Viña Real Plata Crianza,89,21,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,CVNE
123180,Spain,"The nose delivers a light but perceptible blast of sucking candy, children's vitamin and perfume aromas. The palate shows additional candied characteristics, but for the most part it's fresh and easy, with a good feel. Generic as a whole, but competent and satisfying.",Brut,86,12,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Conde de Subirats
123183,Spain,"The smell of honey and lemon-lime soda give this a basic but respectable opening. It's sort of foamy and plump in the mouth, with apple and green-herb flavors. Lacks a little touch but offers bouncy fruit and no overt faults. Imported by Winelink Imports.",Brut Nature,86,14,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Dibon
123186,Spain,"The neon pink color is a dead giveaway that Garnacha is the basis of this rosé. Smells spunky and quite fresh on the nose, with a touch of bubble-gum sweetness. Flavors of raspberry and cotton candy catch the tart and sweet sides of things, so overall it's offering a little of everything. Drink now.",Rosado,86,11,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Rosé,Ilurce
123188,Spain,"A little aggressive out of the chute, with a nose that's sort of raspy. The fruit on the palate is tangy and tastes like early picked nectarines with a lemon twist. Crisp and short, but very clean and focused.",Cordon Rosado Brut,86,12,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
123189,Spain,"Salmon-colored and dense, with aromas of clay, cherry and brown sugar. Pinot Noir-ish in its smoky, dried-berry palate and peppery finish. Robust, solid and with texture.",Rose Brut,86,8,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Cristalino
123190,Spain,"Age is beginning to show up on this gran reserva. It's a little raisiny and Sherried on the nose, while the palate is wiry but not exactly thin, with dry raspberry, pie cherry and plum skin flavors. Baked bean, caramel, vanilla and tobacco all play big roles on the finish, which is scouring and tight. Drink now; it's probably not going to improve with further age.",Viña Real Gran Reserva,86,56,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,CVNE
123192,Spain,"Aromas of cherry-chocolate and rubber are firm and a little closed. And such a bouquet doesn't really portend a flavor profile dominated by pink grapefruit and tight citrus. But that's really where this Cava rests: in the mouth, it's single-mindedly about pink grapefruit, which is fine if that's a flavor you like.",Brut Rosé,86,12,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Conde de Subirats
123193,Spain,"Savory and deep given the price, with dark color, obvious ripeness and even a touch of vanilla and mocha on the nose. Round in the mouth and immensely fruity, with plum and berry flavors blending with vanilla. Textured and medium-long on the finish. Good for everyday quaffing, especially in the cold fall and winter months.",Riscal 1860,86,9,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo,Riscal
123251,Spain,"Interesting and very much showing Navarran qualities, including aromas of black olive, herbs and mossy fruit. The palate has good structure, balance and feel, and thus there's a nice platform for dry black cherry, cassis and mocha flavors. As an '05 it's evolved, still fresh enough, and ready to go.",Reserva,89,15,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Piedemonte
123260,Spain,"Crisp, clean and minerally on the nose, with apple and green-fruit aromas. It has a round, smooth feel and flavors of peach, apple and citrus that will enliven the palate and aid almost any seafood, vegetable or salad. A natural wine with just enough powdery sweetness to raise a smile.",NA,89,18,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Nora
123262,Spain,"Very solid and sturdy, with aromas of apple, lemon-lime, soda cracker and mineral. The palate is fuller and more flavorful than your average cava, with candied apple, papaya, lime and lemon flavors. Dry, pithy and hinting at complexity on the finish.",Reserva Heredad,89,25,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
123266,Spain,"A different breed of blended wine, with earthy aromas of dried cheese, leather, dill and vanilla. The palate is tight and mildly tannic, with sweet cola, roasted berry and earthy tobacco flavors. Not your normal bulky, dark wine; it's complex and based on 85% Garnacha and Carignan.",Masia Carreras,89,42,Northern Spain,Empordà,NA,Red Blend,Martí Fabra
123374,Spain,"Oddly, this is preferable to El Nido's $140 Cab-heavy fruit bomb. Maybe that's because Monastrell is the go-to grape in Jumilla, and this is 70% Monastrell and only 30% Cab compared to the opposite with El Nido. All that said, this wine is ripe, approachable and dark, with excellent balance and a fudgy, warm finish of fruitcake and blackberry. Drink now through 2013.",Clio,93,46,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,El Nido
123378,Spain,"Starts with the scent of beef on the grill, and then folds in black fruit and fine aged cheese. The palate is as rich and smooth as a silk throw, while flavors of berry, cassis, herbs and coffee cover the bases. Mildly balsamic on the finish, yet not complicated, demanding or overly complex. Drink now through 2012.",La Cueva del Contador,93,103,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Benjamin Romeo
123450,Spain,"A touch scratchy and rough on the nose, with pepper and leathery fruit aromas. The palate keeps that edge while offering peppery berry flavors and oak. More tannic and woody than one might hope for, with lactic notes on the finish. Shows flashes but comes up average. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",Flor del Montgó Old Vines,85,NA,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Garnacha,Montgó
123451,Spain,"Silly name but pretty good wine. A tidal wave of cherry/berry aromas is authentic, natural, youthful and floral. The palate is just as bright and bouncy, with red fruit running away with things. A touch of mineral and chocolate at the end gives it some darkness to match the vibrancy.",NA,85,8,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Wrongo Dongo
123453,Spain,"Even though it's a sweet-styled Cava, the nose kicks up lemon and apple aromas that are familiar as can be. The palate, however, is quite sweet and supports the Semi Dry labeling. Candied but not sticky, with a slightly chalky finish.",Carta Nevada Semi Dry,85,9,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
123461,Spain,"Ultra purple and sort of gummy and confected. But it's also pretty solid in the mouth, with tannin instead of flatness holding things together. Tastes like sweet dark plums and candy, while a hint of black coffee darkness enters on the finish.",Viña Berceo Crianza,85,18,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Berceo
123462,Spain,"The Borsao brand is a bargain pioneer, and while the wines aren't $4.99 anymore they are still squarely “value” oriented. This rosé is fairly steely and fresh, with pithy grapefruit and nectarine flavors. Lean and peppery on the finish, and ready to be consumed right away.",NA,85,8,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Rosé,Borsao
123466,Spain,"Already in the twilight of its lifespan, this is a friendly rosé with a little wiggle and kick. The palate sits on ripe nectarine and pink grapefruit, while the finish offers pepper and spice. A little pithy but pretty good if you get at it soon.",NA,85,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Rosé,Tapeña
123497,Spain,"Torres' Celeste debuted in 2003, and the '05 is the best vintage to date. The wine has penetrating berry and spice aromas and an accent of animal leather. The palate is healthy and polished, with plum, blackberry and herbal notes. Comes together well and should be good in the cellar through 2012.",Celeste Crianza,89,22,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Torres
123576,Spain,"Starts out rustic and leathery, with hints of smoke, leafiness and earth along with baked berry and spice. This four-grape wine has good density and mouthfeel that frames leather, earth and slightly baked berry fruit flavors. Finishes chocolaty and sweet, with just enough acidity to maintain balance.",Selección 12 Crianza,89,15,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Luzón
123577,Spain,"A delicious wine and very much the model for value in Spanish Garnacha. That this has 25% Tempranillo only seems to make it better; the nose is sweet but full and plummy. The palate is pure, flavorful and sweet, with baked cherry, earthiness and a hint of chocolate. A wine to buy in quantity, i.e. by the case.",NA,89,8,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Red Blend,Borsao
123582,Spain,"Sappy green apple, grapefruit and citrus aromas are welcoming and pure, while the palate is soft-edged, citrusy and full or tangerine and melon flavors. A good, honest, clean Verdejo that has sure-fire mass appeal. More solid than special, which is what you should want from this kind of wine.",NA,89,16,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Valdelapinta
123591,Spain,"Nutty and toasty, with toffee and butter pecan aromas. The palate is wet, light, alert and snappy, but also angular and citrusy. The acidity here is key; it pushes dried apricot and tangy flavors toward a nutty finish, and overall the wine delivers what a good, higher-end palo cortado should.",Marqués de Rodil Especial Palo Cortado,89,45,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Palomino,Hidalgo
123593,Spain,"Fragrant, clean and tropical, with slate-driven minerality. The palate is just fleshy enough but mostly it's tight and crisp, with flavors of green apple, fresh green herbs and a drip of honey. Holds it together from front to back; just right for salads and seafood-based tapas.",NA,89,19,Northern Spain,Valdeorras,NA,Godello,Gaba do Xil
123672,Spain,"Another stellar El Puntido, this time with excellent concentration and full-load aromas of black fruit, leather, fine dried cheese and cola. The palate is tight, properly stretched and racy, with bursting black raspberry and cassis flavors. Coconut and resin on the finish is the first and only glaring announcement of oak. Drink now through 2014.",El Puntido,93,62,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Viñedos de Paganos
123681,Spain,"Just right on the nose, with a smoky, attractive set of deep berry aromas. The palate is pure and composed, with a pure, tasty mix of berry fruit, cocoa and mild oak. Smooth, long and creamy on the finish, and delicious overall. Best wine to date from Emina. Drink now into 2012.",Prestigio,92,28,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Emina
123688,Spain,"Protos is a flagship Ribera del Duero property and its wines have been on the rise lately. This is ripe and spicy, with black fruit and then a twitch of prune and moss on the nose. It's racy, pure, forward and stout, with a mix of red and black fruit flavors. Warm and integrated on the finish. Drink now through 2013.",Reserva,92,45,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Protos
123753,Spain,"A bit of forward oak comes across on the nose, while mocha and pretty good berry fruit keep things focused. Like most Navarran wines, this is snappy and “red” in character, with herbal tomato and plum flavors. Classic finishing notes of olive and dill close things out.",Selección Reserva,85,23,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Alconde
123758,Spain,"A typically reserved Navarran wine is what this is. The nose offers dry red fruit, spice and not much else. The palate is mildly citric and herbal, but there's enough cherry and leather to carry things to a medium-length   finish of dill, vanilla and spice. A nice and simple food wine.",Crianza,85,13,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Red Blend,Señorío de Sarria
123768,Spain,"A little creamy, waxy and scattershot, but also far more exotic and different than most $8 wines. This is barrel-fermented Viura, but the oak level is light and manageable. Flavors of papaya, melon and citrus are almost tropical in scope, and the finish is pretty fresh. Drink right away for maximum freshness.",Conde de Valdemar,85,8,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Viura,Bodegas Valdemar
123784,Spain,"Light, laudable aromas of wood smoke, cherry, raspberry and licorice are inviting, while the palate is firm but on the precipice of sharp. In general everything is nicely put together, and overall this reserva has nice raspberry, black cherry, pastry and chocolate notes. Hold for at least another year.",Cune Reserva,88,30,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,CVNE
123930,Spain,"Floral fruit aromas suggest blueberry, but overall this vintage lacks the power and depth that Termes and its big brothers are known for. Airing sets up sweet, easygoing berry flavors and full tannins, but in the middle it's less whole than it has been in other years. A juicy, well-made wine that should not be judged as weak just because 2007 was a marginal vintage. Drink now through 2013.",Termes,89,30,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Numanthia
123934,Spain,"Opens with cherry aromas and brightness, then the palate fans out and fattens up with juicy plum and cherry flavors along with just a touch of medicinality. Toasty, warm and tasty, with a thoroughness not usually found in $8 wines. Garnacha at 70% with 30% Syrah.",NA,88,8,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha-Syrah,Coto de Hayas
123944,Spain,"Very smooth with youthful, juicy, fragrant berry aromas along with a bouncy palate full of sweet cherry and cassis flavors. Clean, snappy, alert and healthy. More simple and straightforward than complex, but worth the money and then some.",NA,88,8,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Aletta
123958,Spain,"Yellow in color, with a waxy nose that's baked, rich, a bit stalky but also honeyed. The palate is round, hefty and thick, with full melon and peach flavors in front of a plump, woody finish. Good as you're likely to find among Spanish Chardonnay.",Colección,88,20,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Chardonnay,Viñas del Vero
123965,Spain,"A really nice, dark, modern style of Rioja from a good vintage. The nose is mildly foresty early on and robustly fruity, with stand-out black cherry and blackberry aromas. The palate is full, clean and balanced, with alert flavors of berry, spice, citrus peel and chocolate. Smooth as a glass table on the finish. Drink now through 2014.",Amaren,92,50,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Luis Cañas
124077,Spain,"Smells more meaty and leathery than you might expect for a basic, young Tempranillo. But enough berry fruit sneaks through to make it a solid but narrow wine driven by red plum and other standard red-fruit flavors. Finishes fresh but lean.",NA,84,11,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo,Rivera de Castilla
124087,Spain,"Black licorice, mint and a hint of raisin work the nose. However, the palate on this venerable Ribera wine is a bit jumpy and early on it seems tart and miserly; the upside is that the wine will age for 15 years. To drink now it'll need to go with food. If given plenty of airing or decanting it'll show its best.",Tinto,88,38,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Pesquera
124094,Spain,"The aromas of sarsparilla, tree bark, dried raspberry and cumin take you back to traditional Rioja winemaking. With lighter-weight fruit, herb and tomato leaf flavors, this is a solid old-school wine that will hit the right marks with tapas or roast meats. It's got some tea and tang as well, courtesy of zesty acids.",Gran Reserva,88,34,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Baron De Ley
124241,Spain,"An opening of apricot and peach aromas is proper, while the palate delivers a jolt of zest and acidity to more pineapple, lime and punchy green-apple flavors. Tangy later on, with more than a drop of lemon and lime to the finish. Also slightly pithy and bitter, which is natural for Godello.",NA,88,18,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Godello,Abad Dom Bueno
124246,Spain,"Minerality and crispness define the bouquet, which brings green apple and citrus aromas. There's punch and spritz on the palate as well as sweet citrus and juicy lime flavors that break up a little as they fan out. Not sure if there's residual sugar, but the wine tastes a bit sweet.",NA,88,16,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Lícia
124259,Spain,"Shy at first, with standard raspberry aromas, earth and buttery notes along with cherry and raspberry flavors. Becomes fuller and more satisfying with time, and once it's fully open you have a solid, satisfying Rioja with true flavors and good overall balance.",Crianza,88,14,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Castillo Labastida
124262,Spain,"Full, heavy, chunky wine with a powerful bouquet of black fruit and chocolate. The palate is about as full and concentrated as they come, but there's good balance and aging potential along with cassis, blackberry and mild herbal shadings. Savory and strong as it is long on the finish. Drinkable now but better from 2011–2014.",VS Reserva,91,100,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Red Blend,Val Sotillo
124364,Spain,"Fresh-cut oak is front and center on this now-aging blend of Monastrell and Merlot. There's a green, almost cheesy accent to the nose, which is followed by generic plum flavor. Always resiny and creamy due to the oak, with some prune to the finish.",Enciro Monastrell Merlot,84,10,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,El Bully
124372,Spain,"Mildly raw and reduced, but at $6 expectations shouldn't be too high. In the mouth, it's tangy and light, with zingy strawberry/raspberry flavors that have some scour. Bland but lively.",NA,83,6,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Casa Solar
124375,Spain,"Raw and rough more than flush or lush. The nose deals mildly pickled red-fruit aromas in front of a tight, acidic palate that tastes of pie cherries. Firm and zesty but not much length or substance. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",NA,83,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Herminia
124376,Spain,"Fizzy and foamy and aggressive. To give it a frame of reference, it is similar to Brachetto or Frascati from Italy, but it's clumsy on the palate and tastes too much like red licorice and candied fruit to be taken too seriously. Also a bit cloying on the finish. Imported by National Distributing Co., Inc.",Reynal Vino de Aguja,83,10,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Rosé,Pinord
124390,Spain,"For a large-production Rioja, this sings the proper notes and shiould please almost anyone with a taste for Spanish red wines. It's violet in color, indicating good ripeness. The nose is concentrated and likable, with solid berry and plum fruit to back it up. Round, pleasant and with a touch of oaky vanilla on the finish. Drink now.",Crianza,88,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Ramón Bilbao
124475,Spain,"Opens with a load of sweet, candied black-fruit aromas but this wine excels on the nose because it's composed and precise for being so young and simple in scope. Velvety, rich black-cherry flavors run the show, and the finish brings length and an herbal shading. Very nice for a wine from Toro at this price.",Dama de Toro,88,11,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Fariña
124481,Spain,"Comes out of the chute with some aggression, but that's settled by quality apple and grassy aromas. The palate is jumpy and lively, with pleasant, slightly sweet apple and peach flavors. Shows good refinement, ample layering of flavors and a spot of minerality. As a whole, this is good cava.",Brut,88,17,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Montsarra
124485,Spain,"This is a smooth, subdued style of Rioja that's perfect for tapas or casual consumption. The nose offers the right kind of entry: cherry and raspberry with dusty spice. And the flavors are friendly and suggest black fruits and smoke. A little more oaky and charred than some, but a nice crianza nonetheless.",Crianza,88,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Ramón Bilbao
124487,Spain,"Dusty lemon and cidery aromas are solid and draw you in. The palate has a fresh, clean feel and lively, tangy flavors of citrus, green fruits and green herbs. Zesty, a bit lemony, and nice on the finish. Not a complicated bubbly by any means.",Brut Reserva,88,14,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Sonim
124495,Spain,"Dark and fully oaked Rioja with vanilla, mocha, char and black-fruit aromas. The body is good while the acidity is a bit high, and thus the flavors lean toward tart black cherry and zesty wild blackberry all with a robust amount of toast, spice and charred darkness.",Crianza,88,19,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Obalo
124569,Spain,"Warm, earthy aromas of molasses, moss and baked fruit scream rich and big, and the palate matches that early announcement with cola, baked blackberry, coffee and syrupy flavors. Weighty and forceful, but not without style and a flash of elegance. Pure Toro; drink now through 2012.",Prestigio,91,27,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Cyan
124578,Spain,"A serious, oak-influenced Godello with smooth aromas of baked apple, wood resin, vanilla, spice and green melon. The palate has weight and fine acidity, so it's tight despite delivering a blast of oaky flavor. Alongside that resiny taste, there's green banana and peach notes. Fresh but woody; should age well for at least another 18 months.",NA,90,30,Northern Spain,Valdeorras,NA,Godello,Avanthia
124581,Spain,"A round, chewy wine with a nice mix of black fruit, vanilla, aged cheese and light balsam wood on the nose. The palate is big but doesn't bite back, and the flavors of creamy berry are broad and nice. A very solid wine with weight and heat; drink now through 2011.",Abadia de San Quirce Reserva,90,45,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Imperiales
124650,Spain,"Garnacha-Cabernet Sauvignon is the blend and it's showing some age. The nose is a little heavy and murky, and so is the palate. Flavors of melon and papaya are more plump than zesty and driven. Falls rather flat on the finish. Wait for the 2008.",NA,83,8,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Rosé,Vega Sindoa
124655,Spain,"All over the map. The nose offers toast offset by gym sweat, while the palate is both tangy yet pickled, with zingy orange flavors. The wine flows across the tongue but leaves a bit of citrus rind and vinegar. Not bad per se, but has some weak links. Imported by Winelink Imports.",Demi Sec,83,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Dibon
124656,Spain,"Big in color, with meaty, rubbery aromas that seem reduced and gaseous. The palate is black and toasty, but sort of rubbery. Burnt toast, black coffee and some bitterness control the finish. More colorful and big than flavorful and complete.",Vino Joven,83,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Lar de Sotomayor
124664,Spain,"A bit too rubbery and gassy to qualify as “clean,” with leafiness running the bouquet. The palate is sort of flat, with raisin, baked cherry and prune flavors. It's on the borderline of being stewed.",Tinto,83,9,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Agustín Cubero
124668,Spain,"Not super fruity. Instead it's a generic, racy specimen with lots of zap, kick and zest but not much style, warmth or fruit. Shows fiery flavors and a tight, driving finish. Expect many 2007s, including this one, to be on the miserly side.",NA,83,11,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Campellares
124670,Spain,"As a young wine, this is bold, dark, crusty and slightly out of joint. There are salty, balsamic flavors along with muscular berry notes, and then butter and other barrel-driven flavors on the finish. It's chunky bordering on huge, with balance and integration issues. Maybe a little better in six months.",Saludo,83,11,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Luis Gurpegui Muga
124672,Spain,"Gummy, pasty and sweet, with no real elegance or finesse. It's simply a dark, candied wine that's pure tutti-frutti. And the feel is more narrow than one might hope for given the wine's immense color and body.",El Chaparral Old Vine,82,13,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Grenache,Vega Sindoa
124679,Spain,"Toasty and rubbery aromas lead to a drastic, rather sharp palate of brazen red cherry and plum. More tang and pickled than rich and rewarding, with a fiery mouthfeel and scouring acidity.",NA,82,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,El Circulo
124692,Spain,"Here's a wine that manages to blend classic notes of dryness, fine acidity and red fruit with modern weight, ripeness, oak and color. It's not otherwordly but it does pass all the tests. The fruit is fine but regular, while the finish hints at licorice and chocolate. A no-frills winner without a lot of fanfare.",Reserva,88,26,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marqués de Murrieta
124695,Spain,"During the harvest last fall winemaker and owner Vicki Pariente said 2007 would be a lean year in Rueda with some great wines. Hers is very pungent and full of nettles, sweat and other cool-climate symptoms. Which doesn't make it a bad wine; just tight, lean and green. If you have liked Dos Victorias Verdejo in the past, stick with it in '07.",José Pariente,87,19,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Dos Victorias
124800,Spain,"Brickish in color, with mature aromas of cedar, pine, tobacco, olive and dried fruits. There's still some racy acidity that's keeping the rooty flavors of tobacco, dried berry, coffee and spice moving forward. Finishes dry and a little bit classic; drink now for an affordable taste of Navarra.",Crianza,88,14,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Castillo de Monjardin
124805,Spain,"Crisp and minerally up front, with aromas of apple, peach and dust. It's fresh, maybe a touch basic at its core, with flavors of apple cider, apricot and almond skins. There's nothing not to like about this Albariño, which is pure, pithy on the finish, and more than solid in a pedestrian, familiar sort of way.",Single Vineyard,88,18,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Finca de Arantei
124810,Spain,"Smooth on the nose, with a pinch of rubber, earth, smoked beef and plum/prune. The palate offers structure, solid acidity, zestiness and bright flavors of cherry and raspberry. Finishes crisp and tight, with lingering vanilla. A nice wine for tapas and other meat-based dishes.",Reserva,88,18,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Ondarre
124811,Spain,"While I prefer the 2009 for its clarity and freshness, this '08 is no slouching tiger. The nose delivers still-fresh apple and mineral aromas, while the flavor profile leans toward gooseberry, lemon and green melon. Shows some pithy bitterness on the finish, so drink right away or seek out the '09.",NA,88,19,Northern Spain,Valdeorras,NA,Godello,Gaba do Xil
124823,Spain,"Mineral, lime and crisp apple aromas give it a precise, pure nose. And that same character exists on the palate and finish, where white peach, green banana and melon flavors are full and forward. Shows good concentration and quality for a large-production bubbly at this price.",Aria Estate Brut,88,14,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
124860,Spain,"Jammy and sweet smelling, with intensity and a lot of ripeness. Throughout it teeters on the precipice of being overripe, but amid the chunky darkness and sweetness there's tasty berry, chocolate and spice. Finishes a bit pruney and raisiny, so get at it as soon as you can.",Gaudium,90,64,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Marqués de Cáceres
124865,Spain,"An interesting, well-made wine with distinct barrel notes. There's woodspice, toast, vanilla and elegant white fruit on the nose, yet the palate maintains Verdejo's natural verve while offering flavors of cinnamon apple, spiced pear, banana and tropical fruit. Drier on the finish, with a nip of butterscotch.",Selección Personal,90,36,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Emina
124880,Spain,"Full, earthy and ripe, but also delivering alot of clean fruit, size and balance. The palate has moderate to full tannic grip, which props up berry, vanilla, wood and mild herbal flavors. Long, solid and a little oaky late, with proper purity and a commitment to the near future. Drink now through 2011.",Crianza,90,35,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Val Sotillo
124887,Spain,"An attractive, ripe wine that pushes up against raisiny but then draws back to focus on blackberry, licorice and other dark aromas and flavors. Very good weight and mouthfeel, with nice balance supporting ripe berry, cola and mild chocolate flavors. Finishes lush and warm. Drink now through 2011.",Crianza,90,30,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Finca Torremilanos
124951,Spain,"A different breed of cat. The nose is akin to nail polish and sweet perfume, while the palate is super simple and doesn't rise much above liquid candy. Not awful but not challenging or refined. Has a lasting simple jamminess that isn't elevating.",Old Vine Seleccion,82,9,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Mirone
124957,Spain,"Violet in color but sassy. The nose is pickled and brambly, while the palate offers crusty berry fruit and herbal, marinated flavors. Edgy and sharp as feel goes, with an angular, acid-driven finish.",Heredad de Las Suertes,82,14,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodega San Pedro Apóstol
124960,Spain,"Tobacco, spice and cranberry aromas mix with nutty leather and sweat. This is a tangy, choppy wine with more tomato and citrus flavor than ripe berry fruit. So even for fans of classic Rioja this will seem light, lean and leathery.",Antaño Crianza,82,9,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,J. Garcia Carrion
124963,Spain,"A little jammy up front, but mostly this is dull and bland, with generic citrus-inspired flavors and some bitterness late. Can't see this really helping out food or standing alone as an apéritif.",Rosé,82,6,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Casa Solar
124964,Spain,"Mami Mia, this is heavy stuff. The nose on this Garnacha-Graciano mix is muddled and rubbery, while the palate is saturated but murky. Finishes almost salty, with a hint of the veggies. A loud wine that doesn't really say anything.",NA,82,13,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Garnacha-Graciano,Casita Mami
124970,Spain,"No Time is the name but unfortunately there's no substance and no richness. As a whole, this Garnacha smells of bramble and pickle, while the palate is fresh and bouncy but sour.",Garnacha Cepas Viejas,81,11,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Garnacha,No Time
124972,Spain,"Despite basic strawberry and red licorice aromas, this wine is decidedly tart. It hits with snappy nectarine flavors and then turns citric and finishes up sour. Doesn't offer much rosé pleasure; makes you wonder what's the point.",Rosé,81,11,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo,Rivera de Castilla
124974,Spain,"Flat and loamy on the nose, and then slightly floral. There is not much going on here; the palate offers distant strawberry flavors accented by pickle, and the finish is thin, tangy and hints at tomato. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",Excelsus,81,23,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Viña Herminia
124977,Spain,"This wine doesn't do much for Navarra's reputation as prime Spanish rosé country. It's a little burnt and acrid, with weak and muddled raspberry and pickle flavors. Finishes dry as a soda cracker.",Rosado,81,10,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Rosé,Señorío de Sarria
125072,Spain,"Starts out a little gaseous and sulfuric, but it picks up steam in the mouth, where flavors of apricot, citrus and tropical fruits perform a likeable dance. Powerful acidity pushes it in the right direction, and the finish of lychee, passion fruit and nectarine is lasting. Very nice wine but relatively high in price.",NA,88,25,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Mar de Frades
125082,Spain,"Stylistically, this is at odds with what I feel Albariño should be. That said, it's a well-executed and well-made barrel-fermented white with full-force toast and popcorn aromas followed by a resiny, vanilla-fueled flavor profile that folds in apple, banana and creamy frosting. Still vital and healthy after three years in bottle.",Nora da Neve,88,29,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Nora
125090,Spain,"For Navarran Merlot-Cab, Inurrieta Norte is always a winner. This vintage has good darkness along with smooth aromas of black fruit, earth, rubber and spice. It's a bit acidic and shrill as a tasting wine but will do fine at the table. The mouth is spunky and shows slightly herbal raspberry and plum flavors. Finishes light and easy.",Norte,87,15,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Inurrieta
125091,Spain,"For a rosado cava, this offers nice fruit, balance and complexity. The nose is pure cherry and raspberry, but in subdued doses. Meanwhile, it's zesty, foamy and fresh in the mouth, with nectarine, plum, strawberry and prickle. Perfectly nice for everyday quaffing.",Cordon Rosado Brut,87,12,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
125165,Spain,"For a Valencia D.O. wine, this is darn appealing. The nose is warm, rooty and smells of cola nut, fresh raisins and cassis, while the driving palate offers roasted black fruit flavors along with sweet tomato and herbs. Drying and tannic on the finish, but balanced. Neither cooked nor overweight. Drink now through 2011.",N° 12 Selección Especial,90,35,Levante,Valencia,NA,Red Blend,Venta del Puerto
125176,Spain,"Pine needle, cedar plank and forest floor define the mature nose, while the full, grabby, tannic palate is loaded with likable cola, black fruit and chocolate flavors. Ripe, pure, rich and tannic, with some bite, burn and ruggedness. Drinkable now but needs food to cut the tannins.",Prestigio,90,25,Northern Spain,Cigales,NA,Tempranillo,Val de Los Frailes
125184,Spain,"There's no denying the wine's power and intensity. It's concentrated like a cement block, with richness, plummy aromas, sweetness and char. But it's also candied and ultrarich in the mouth, with syrupy flavors of berry extract, cola and chocolate. A heavy wine that shows every ounce of its 15.5% alcohol. Ultimately it's more sweet and powerful than it is precise. Drink now through 2013.",NA,90,142,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Cabernet Blend,El Nido
125185,Spain,"This wine gets it right. The color is dark and opaque, while the nose offers perfume, Middle Eastern spice, fruitcake and solid black fruit. Enticing in the mouth, where full black fruit flavors are pumped up by fine herb and spice notes. And then coffee and chocolate fill the finish. Drink now through 2010.",Jaros,90,35,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Finca El Quiñón
125255,Spain,"A dud given that this is the winery's top effort. It's green and vegetal, with ashtray aromas. More like salad than wine. Not too many wines these days are blatantly bell peppery, but this is.",Reserva Especial,80,40,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Red Blend,Señorío de Sarria
125286,Spain,"Cáceres does basic Viura as well as anyone in Spain. Every year this wine shows a confident blend of citrus and mineral, with aromas of citrus fruits and pineapple and flavors of green apple and lime. It's juicy, fresh and amounts to the quintessential summer sipper.",NA,87,8,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Viura,Marqués de Cáceres
125290,Spain,"For inexpensive Albariño, Nessa delivers the goods. The nose is flowery and soft, but most of all it's inviting.

Drink right away.",NA,87,12,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Nessa
125302,Spain,"Cotton candy and warm, dusty aromas give the wine pleasant, semisweet opening aromas. The palate is round and solidly formed, with creamsicle flavors and a bit of brown sugar or treacle. A good wine with just a touch of sweetness in the middle; must be a touch of residual sugar here.",NA,87,9,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Rosé,Marqués de Cáceres
125388,Spain,"Aromas of cherry and leather come with burnt earth and smoke, but overall the nose is inviting. The palate is solid in feel, with good weight and drive that supports a smoky flavor profile of red berries and controlled bitterness. Finishes toasty, with a lick of bitter chocolate.",Elyssia Pinot Noir Brut,87,18,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
125394,Spain,"A perfectly solid Garnacha with pepper, bright red fruit and a touch of country style to the bouquet despite its pedestrian price. The palate is bright and tastes of plum and red berry, while the feel is good and the finish fruity and lively. What inexpensive red wine should be.",NA,87,7,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Crucillon
125468,Spain,"Opens with sly, clean mineral and white fruit aromas that hook you into its lively but round palate of citrus, green melon and fresh herbs. There's plenty of fruit and acidity to keep it moving, and overall it's a Verdejo done right.",Old Vines,89,15,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Shaya
125483,Spain,"Ripe, stout and concentrated on the bouquet, with cassis and lightly roasted berry aromas. Solid and tannic in the mouth, with full plum and cherry flavors.

125580,Spain,"This wine is clearly shooting for the modern style of Rioja; it's dark as night, soft and meaty. But it also has a lot of gaseous sulfur on the nose and hard tannins. Expect a chewy, broad Rioja that's hedonistic but on the cusp of overripe. Decant before drinking within the next two years.",Martin Cendoya Reserva,87,38,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Heredad Ugarte
125587,Spain,"A little rough around the edges, i.e. there's a sharp note to the nose and then lots of barrel char to back that up. There's black fruit, pepper and lots of oak on the palate, which has a full feel and then firm, clamping tannins.",Lanzaga,87,30,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Telmo Rodríguez
125604,Spain,"Watermelon, cantaloupe and peach aromas are just as they should be, while the palate is whole, fresh and full of tangerine and nectarine.

125608,Spain,"Coconut and wintergreen aromas announce new oak, and as it opens this somewhat muscular Rioja unveils butter and charred scents. It's full, with good acid-to-tannin balance, and the fruit is forward and ripe. A little bit sweet and chunky in the final analysis, but a nice modern-influenced Rioja on the whole. Drink now through 2009.",Inspiración Valdemar,87,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Valdemar
125672,Spain,"Clear and focused, with raspberry and edgy spice aromas to the nose. The palate doesn't bring a whole bunch of meat or heft, but it is clean, racy and food-friendly. Flavors of red berries and pepper are normal and expected, while the finish is dry and lean.",Crianza,87,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Marqués de Cáceres
125674,Spain,"Lime, citrus and other pungent aromas get it off to a good start, while the palate is wet and fresh, with clean, familiar grapefruit, lime and nectarine flavors. Lighter and less concentrated than Naia, but still a very good Verdejo for the price.",Ducado de Altan,87,13,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Naia
125687,Spain,"Dry and subtle on the nose, with cherry and plum fruit scents mixed with balsam wood.

125689,Spain,"Timid but clean as a whistle on the nose, with apple and vanilla aromas along with a sprinkling of talcum powder.

125693,Spain,"Dry and peppery to start, with muted berry fruit aromas along with wood shavings. The palate is snappy, clean and juicy, with raspberry, vanilla and tobacco-like flavors. More basic than special, with a steady, light-framed finish. More than functional; likely good with food.",Añares Reserva,87,18,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Olarra
125766,Spain,"Opens with floral, blueberry aromas, mineral notes and a spot of jammy candy.

Very nice wine.",Crianza,89,27,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto Fino,Legaris
125778,Spain,"A solid, serious Rioja reserva with licorice, leather, char and good berry aromas. The palate is juicy, pure and tastes of clean black cherry and cola flavors. Picks up steam as it opens up, and then finishes with a light butter streak and proper weight. No complaints; almost makes the upper echelon.

125980,Spain,"This is your quintessential simple quaff among brut cavas. It's clean, lime-tinged and soda-like on the nose, with a correct, no-issues palate that pushes zesty apple along with sweet papaya, mango and banana flavors. It's slightly sweet and tropical, but still it holds onto its crisp qualities and dryness. No complaints for the money.",Cordon Negro Brut,87,12,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
125982,Spain,"Slightly low on kick and bubbles for a blanc de blancs, but the wine's mix of green herb, apple, green banana and melon flavors is good and offers the proper set up to a finish that's citrusy as can be and only slightly pithy. Seems a touch flat or it might have rated even higher.",Brut Blanc de Blancs,87,18,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Paul Cheneau
125984,Spain,"Dusty, slightly candied aromas are briary and pretty good, and overall it's giving freshness, pop and red-fruit flavors touched up by dill, nutmeg and vanilla. Clean and lively on the finish, and more than competent as a whole.",Limited Edition,87,17,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Ramón Bilbao
125987,Spain,"Starts out with roasted, stewy, beefy aromas and not much brightness. The palate is measured and healthy, with dry raspberry, currant and medicinal plum flavors. It shows oak, earth, leather, acidity and some burn. In a nutshell, it's a good, standard, respectable Rioja that will complement almost any food.",Reserva,87,26,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Solabal
125990,Spain,"A heavy, slightly strained wine that has a lot in tow. The nose is smoky, rubbery like an inner tube, and a bit herbal. In the mouth, it's a wide load with sweet, sugary, baked flavors of blackberry, prune, fig and chocolate. Very much on the ripe side, with a full tannic bite.",Lanzaga,87,34,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Telmo Rodríguez
125992,Spain,"Initially it's rugged, but airing reveals black-cherry aromas and dry spice. The palate is crisp and a little sheer by itself, but the call here is that with food it'll be a winner. Flavors of red fruits are dry and collected, while the finish blends in coffee, spice and a touch of herbal Navarran panache.",Crianza,87,15,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Marco Real
125995,Spain,"Good on the nose, with solid raspberry and nectarine aromas. The palate is spunky and alert, with juicy red-cherry, rhubarb and integrated spice flavors. It's mostly a clean, basic, easy-to-drink bubbly, but it's persistent, harmonious and commendable. Pinot Noir with Trepat is the grape mix.",999 Brut Rosat,87,15,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Loxarel
125997,Spain,"Aromas of apple cider and mild spice get it going in a good direction, and this colorfully packaged cava does pretty well in the mouth, where the texture is on the soft side and the flavors of apple and orange run a bit sweet. Not complex but good, fluffy and yeasty.",Lady of Spain Brut,87,15,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Paul Cheneau
126060,Spain,"Definitely a once-ripe, raisiny wine with hard Toro tannins and molasses aromas and flavors. Borderline syrupy but with enough structure and grip to make the grade. Warming and rich wine, with a fierce strucutre and big tannic framework. Drink now.",12 Meses,88,19,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Cyan
126062,Spain,"Bold and chunky Ribera wine with black fruit aromas that don't tread lightly. The palate is lush and features a nice overall feel, while the flavors of berry fruit and chocolate hint at raisin but don't fully cross the threshhold. Heavier and darker than prior years. Drink now.",NA,88,25,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Comenge
126066,Spain,"There's an exotic twist to the nose, which rests on black cherry, plum and a splash of black coffee. The palate is sound and structured, with dark fruit flavors accented by spice and tea notes. Comfortable on the finish, with good tannins and acids holding it all together. Drink now.",Crianza,88,30,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Qumrán
126067,Spain,"Full, ripe and so tannic in its present form that it's scratchy and hard on the mouth. Aromas of ripe berry and syrup hint at its core power, while flavors of blackberry, fresh raisin and chocolate are true and good. A powerpacked wine with a fierce mouthfeel; only time can bring it around. Hold until 2011.",Tinto Roa Reserva,88,40,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas y Viñedos Rauda
126074,Spain,"Peachy, mildly sweet, smooth and inviting. Godeval always makes a true and easy wine that showcases the essence of Godello but doesn't go off the blueprint. Flavors of apple and citrus are well blended, and the grapefruity finish is only mildly pithy. Eminently drinkable white wine from Spain.",Cosecha,88,19,Northern Spain,Valdeorras,NA,Godello,Viña Godeval
126278,Spain,"A touch raisiny and sweet from nose to tail, but what's in between is convincing for Jumilla. Aromas of licorice and herbs are sweet but nice, while the flavors or raisin and blackberry are chunky, with a basic finish that's a little flat but definitely ripe. A blend of Monastrell, Cabernet, Tempranillo and Merlot that's ready to drink.",Taja Reserva,87,12,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Mähler-Besse
126286,Spain,"For Spanish Chardonnay, this is perfectly good and clean. The nose brings your basic set of white-fruit, mineral and fresh herb flavors, while the palate is lively despite some dry, resiny oak flavor. Even with banana, vanilla and creamy flavors, the wine is decidedly not cloying.",NA,87,14,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Chardonnay,Vega Sindoa
126292,Spain,"This winery is known for red Mencía, but this small-lot Godello is perfectly nice and drinkable. It has a neutral nose and a fresh palate of green melon, nectarine and apple flavors. The finish is clipped and a touch bitter, but there's no denying its tangy, forward approach. Only 250 cases made.",NA,87,22,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Godello,Luna Beberide
126297,Spain,"Dusty earth and dry spice aromas blend with some char, vanilla and berry/cherry on the nose. The palate shows average density and depth, with lighter flavors of strawberry, raspberry, herbs, tobacco and vanilla. Finishes dry and peppery, with some toast.",Reserva,87,25,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Dinastía Vivanco
126368,Spain,"A blend of Tempranillo with Cab Sauvignon and Merlot. Aromas of black cherry, spice, aged cheese and earth are solid, while the palate features good fruit but some weakness in structure. Flavors of black cherry and berry are rich at first but fade fast, while the finish is nice but short on complexity. Drink now through 2012.",TSM,88,NA,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Carmelo Rodero
126377,Spain,"A round, full specimen with mineral-laden raspberry aromas and a fresh but serious palate of berry, cherry cough drop and fine rubber. There's a distinct creamy, oaky feel that's confirmed by finishing flavors of vanilla, mocha and woodspice. A step up the ladder for Campo de Borja.",NA,88,18,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha-Syrah,Pagos del Moncayo
126386,Spain,"Coconut and vanilla aromas are squarely in the lead, but the nose's berry base is more than solid. Plump, round and showing good overall balance, with flavors of cola, dark fruit and coconut. A ripe, bulky crianza with plenty of leftover oak on the finish.",Selección Crianza,88,22,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Ramirez de la Piscina
126387,Spain,"A little heavy and sweet on the nose, but juicy and deep on the palate, with round, pleasant lemon, grapefruit and green melon flavors. Dry, pure and driving white wine with a long, clean finish. Galician Godello in good form.",Alma de Blanco,88,15,Galicia,Monterrei,NA,Godello,Pazo das Tapias
126481,Spain,"There's no shortage of ripe aromas: leather, berries and aged cheese. Yet the palate is quite sharp, with searing acidity sitting on top of red-berry flavors. This wine has unlimited aging potential, but will it ever taste great? That remains to be seen.",Alba de Breton,86,72,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Breton
126482,Spain,"A blend of Tempranillo and Garnacha fruit that leaves a red tint and sweet aromas. The palate has plenty of jump and bounce in its step, while the flavors are both sweet and sour. A little sheer but a good wine with ample character.",Conde de Valdemar Rosado,86,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Rosé,Bodegas Valdemar
126504,Spain,"Leafy and peppery on the nose, with light red-fruit aromas and some citrus peel. It runs more lean and spicy than anything, with hints of tomato leaf, fennel and sausage.",Gran Reserva,86,25,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Castillo Clavijo
126509,Spain,"El Coto has gotten its game in gear in recent years. The brand's value-priced wines like this Viura are clean and proper. In this case, opening aromas of stone and lime yield to green fruits and cucumber. The wine is easy and fresh, with a juicy, simple mouthfeel.",NA,86,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Viura,El Coto
126570,Spain,"Clean and minerally, with stony aromas along with banana and pineapple. The palate is tight, clean and balanced, with flavors of green banana, papaya and apple. Finishes pithy and with a touch of fresh-grated white pepper. A good but common type of unoaked Chardonnay.",El Cerezo,87,12,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Chardonnay,Castillo de Monjardin
126575,Spain,"A clean, fresh, appealing sort of Tempranillo with cola, earth, black cherry and berry aromas followed by a bright, forward, spicy cherry palate. Honest, snappy, healthy and juicy; nice and solid for La Mancha.",Flor del Montgó,87,12,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,Montgó
126577,Spain,"Simple, nice and not trying too hard; this basic brut is graced with nice apple and citrus aromas. The palate is wet, juicy and classic, with crisp apple, green herb and melon flavors. Round, clean and just crisp enough.",Brut Reserva,87,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
126583,Spain,"Fresh smelling, with notes of green melon, apple, honey and minerals. It's more simple than complex, with crisp apple and orange flavors and then a chunky, slightly pithy finish. For under $15 this is good, casual Albariño that won't steer you wrong.",Verdemar,87,14,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Montecillo
126662,Spain,"A heavier style of Rioja, with raisin and prune aromas and a brandied character. The palate is expectedly flush and ripe, with weight and size along with black cherry and herbal tea flavors. Shows good stamina and fullness on the finish. Ready to drink now before it starts to fade.",Barón D'Anglade Reserva,88,40,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Franco-Españolas
126664,Spain,"Heavier and oakier than No. 12, and in our opinion not quite as balanced. The nose is rich, minty and raisiny, while the rock-solid palate has fierce tannic grip and flavors of black cherry, tomato and cola. Firm and composed on the finish, but a pounding heavyweight. Drink now thru 2012.",N° 18 Vendimia Seleccionada,88,45,Levante,Valencia,NA,Red Blend,Venta del Puerto
126672,Spain,"Crisp on the bouquet, with green apple and controlled fresh celery aromas. The palate is also fresh, with basic roundness, bounce and natural flavors of apple cider, citrus and lime. Finishes with a slice of white grapefruit and a tiny spot of pith. Drink immediately.",NA,88,18,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Ermita Veracruz
126676,Spain,"Aromas of sawdust announce oak, but otherwise the nose is earthy and fairly attractive, with plum and rooty notes. Round, ripe, tannic and solid in the mouth, with broad flavors of black cherry, rubber and oak. Shows good grip on a slightly oaky, medicinal finish. Hold another nine months to let the oak settle.",Bestué de Otto Bestué Finca Santa Sabina,88,20,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon-Tempranillo,Bodega Otto Bestué
126678,Spain,"Immediately this strikes you as true Verdejo from Rueda. It has pungency on the nose, with accents of cucumber and celery to the primary passion fruit, apricot and citrus aromas. Plenty of zing to it, and tastes of citrus and fresh green apples. Then tangerine and grapefruit carry the finish. Varietally correct.",NA,88,14,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Condesa Eylo
126679,Spain,"Quite rustic smelling, with hickory smoke, barbecue sauce, spice and cola aromas. Like most Cigales wines, it has a firm tannic bite and a grating mouthfeel. But the flavors of roast berry, black plum and savory marinade is good and par for the course. Drink now.",Pago de las Costanas,88,60,Northern Spain,Cigales,NA,Tempranillo,Val de Los Frailes
126680,Spain,"Incognito deftly describes the unusual beet and blueberry aromas on this wine, which is a bit narrow and scracthy. On the plus side, it's concentrated and powerful, with bold berry flavors, tannic grip and herbal influences. Chunky on the finish but lacks the precision and identifiable Ribera del Duero character that a $75 wine should have.",NA,88,75,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Terra Incognita
126784,Spain,"Not an expressive Rueda but it sizzles. Despite being young and driving, it's more neutral in flavor and texture than the winery's Verdejo, which is excellent. This wine shows all citrus with light green accents, and with shrimp or Asian foods it'll do well.",NA,86,10,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,White Blend,Valdelainos
126794,Spain,"This semisweet blend of Malvasia and Viura is not everyday stuff, but if you have a taste for something sweet and different, give it a try. The nose is floral and waxy, while flavors of honey and ultraripe pineapple are heady and sugary. Not a drop-dead winner but unique and interesting.",Diamante Semi-Sweet Malvasia-Viura,86,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Bodegas Franco-Españolas
126803,Spain,"Almond, sherry and banana aromas start it out. The palate is mellow and smooth, with apple and touches of lemon. There's ring and some zing on the finish, but not too much as the wine is beginning to show signs of reaching early maturity. Drink immediately.",Pazo Barrantes,86,23,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Pazo de Barrantes
126808,Spain,"Tan in color, with short flashes of apple and spice on the bouquet. The palate has a small level of oxidation, while the mouthfeel benefits from smooth but present acidity. Limited in scope and flavor, but solid for a wine that's beginning to fade.",Gran Vinum,85,24,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Adegas Gran Vinum
126871,Spain,"Fresh and full of lime on the nose, and overall this is simple, smooth and gives you little reason to worry or fuss. The palate is smooth, creamy and a little low on acids, thus the lemon-lime and melon flavors have a fullness that's sweet and good.",Extra Dry,86,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
126881,Spain,"Sweet and a little grassy on the nose, with lemon-lime aromas. The palate has a solid, regular, friendly feel along with sweet flavors of white nectarine, apple juice and tarragon. Perfectly quaffable, dry in feel despite being semisweet, and balanced. For the price, what's not to like? Imported",Carta Nevada Brut,86,9,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
126963,Spain,"Maturing fairly well, with brown edges to the wine's earthy hue. The nose is rooty and deep, but there's a definite cheesy, mildly bretty accent to it. And the mouthfeel is defined by major tannic grip and bite. Warm and mildly raisiny, with caramel on the finish. Drink now.",Pago de la Calera,87,55,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Cyan
126968,Spain,"Slightly prickly on the nose, but there's balancing melony sweetness to keep it on line. The palate is fresh and snappy, with citrus flavors, particularly grapefruit. And the finish is lemony and dry. No glaring faults; good Verdejo to drink ASAP.",Azumbre Vendimia Seleccionada,87,18,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Agricola Castellana
126979,Spain,"Firm, earthy and rubbery aromas lead to a tight, focused palate with robust black cherry in the lead and black tea and coffee notes along the side. Toasty, dark and a touch bitter on the finish, and overall it's a solid crianza with condensed flavors and a basic mouthfeel.",Crianza,87,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Ramirez de la Piscina
127053,Spain,"Sassy pepper and light rhubarb aromas give this medium-weight crianza a spicy, lean outlook. The palate has tang, vibrant red fruit and mildly grating acidity, while the finish runs zesty and rings about your mouth as it does a spicy fade. A wine for current consumption.",Crianza,85,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Campo Viejo
127054,Spain,"Light berry and sugar cookie aromas kick it off, followed by peach pit and nectarine flavors. For a wine that's basic in composition and a little dilute, it's also fresh and held together by good acidity. Straightforward but solid.",Reinares,85,8,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Rosé,Bodegas Eguren
127055,Spain,"Clean, fresh and simple. Gran Feudo will neither thrill nor disappoint as it delivers adequate citrus, raspberry and rhubarb flavors propelled by choppy, stinging acids. It shows a good attack before breaking up on the finish. A can't-fail rosé for the summer and fall of 2008.",Gran Feudo,85,12,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Rosé,Bodegas Julián Chivite
127173,Spain,"A neutral cava with white candy and mango on the nose. The palate is both foamy and scouring, with soda cracker, apple and citrus pith creating the flavor profile and finish. Shows basic flavors, normal mouthfeel and scouring acidity.",Brut,86,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Sàniger
127174,Spain,"Opens somewhat clipped and choppy, with citrusy aromas mixed with red fruits. The palate is healthy, lean and acidic, with bright plum and berry flavors softened by some creamy vanilla. A solid wine with punch, acidity and a good finish.",Reserva,86,19,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Ramón Bilbao
127185,Spain,"Lucid and basically colorless, with flowery, lychee-like aromas that suggest Malvasia or Moscatel. But it's only Viura and Chardonnay, and it tastes fresh, floral and nice, with lime and lychee. About as easy as they come.",Viura-Chardonnay,86,12,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,White Blend,Ochoa
127197,Spain,"A bit unusual and confusing, but that's because it hails from the Rioja region. The nose is herbal and mustardy, with green aromas leading to a cidery palate of apples and spice. There's also a bit of lemon and creaminess to this cava. Hard to understand but not without its merits.",Casa Conde de Haro,86,27,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Muga
127267,Spain,"Dark, roasted lead aromas frame secondary baked black fruit and leather scents, while the palate is oaky, stocky and tannic, with creamy, barrel-led berry flavors and more than adequate balance and freshness. Mocha and toast are key finishing notes, and overall it's a nice blend of 85% Garnacha with Syrah.",Garnacha-Syrah,87,12,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Grenache-Syrah,Penelope Sanchez
127277,Spain,"One of Spain's top value-oriented rosés. It's inviting, colorful, easy to understand and tasty. Aromas of fresh fruits and melon get it going, while the palate is clean, fresh, only mildly candied and full of cherry and red plum flavors. Scores high by keeping it simple. Drink ASAP.",NA,87,8,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Rosé,Borsao
127279,Spain,"A clean, almost oceanic opening is fresh and citrusy as it should be, while the palate shows pulse, balance and a little scour to go with orange, grapefruit and other citrusy flavors. Pithy and biting late, with ample fruit throughout.",NA,87,15,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo-Viura,Esperanza
127378,Spain,"A forward specimen with lots of oak that settles on cinnamon and wood tannin. Also a touch leafy on the nose, and that's backed by tangy cranberry and acid-driven cherry flavors. Very tight and piercing, which for a 2005 crianza is asking too much.",Crianza,85,30,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Hemar
127379,Spain,"A crisp, clean, no-frills white wine that pushes citrus more than heft. Mineral and lime aromas set up zesty citrus flavors, and overall it's a scouring but steady rendition that'll do best when served well chilled.",Solaz Blanco,85,9,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Viura,Osborne
127442,Spain,"The quality of the 2009 vintage is reflected in this value-priced Toro that's full and medicinal but also balanced and rewarding. Flavors of medicinal red-berry fruit are mixed with thicker, chocolaty notes, while the finish is bold, grabby and solid. A blend of Tempranillo and Garnacha.",NA,86,8,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Caño
127449,Spain,"Clean and approachable, with lemon-lime aromas leading to an easy, mildly crisp palate with lemon, lime and honeydew flavors.

127458,Spain,"Apple, spearmint, mixed greens and citrus carry the bouquet to a firm palate with dry papaya, lemon and herb flavors. Finishes with apple, lemon and bitterness. Very basic and quaffable, but nothing extraordinary.",Cuvee Henri,86,15,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Loxarel
127569,Spain,"Slightly saucy on the nose, with jammy, baked fruit aromas hinting at cherry and raspberry. The palate feel is a little tough but healthy, with red fruit flavors accented by vanilla and coconut. Tight, crisp and showing a final wave of tomato on the finish.",Roble,87,23,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Mesoneros de Castilla
127571,Spain,"Aromas of Christmas spice, pepper and dried fruit fall more into the traditional category than modern, while the palate is snappy, a little lean and delivers strawberry and raspberry fruit with a light buttery oak note. Tight and dry on the finish, but lean. Ready to drink.",Reserva,87,30,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Marqués de Vargas
127578,Spain,"Neutral aromas of citrus and almond skin precede a jumpy, fresh and spritzy palate of green apple and citrus flavors. Tight, crisp, food-friendly white wine with cut and zest. Comfortably fits the Rueda/Verdejo model.",Viña Clavidor,87,14,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Bodegas Vidal Soblechero
127579,Spain,"Much more fresh and perky than previous years, with grapefruit, nectarine and other citrusy aromas.

Drink now.",NA,87,18,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Godello,Abad Dom Bueno
127615,Spain,"A great Priorat, plain and simple. And while we have always liked Les Eres from Joan Simó, this vintage is the best we've tried. The nose is beautiful: coffee, cola, schist, black fruit and herbs rise up. In the mouth, there's strength but restraint; huge black fruit, pulsing tannins and subtleties. Power and precision as well. A brilliant wine that can be drunk now with decanting, or better: hold for another 4–12 years.",Les Eres Vinyes Velles,95,84,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Joan Simó
127658,Spain,"The aromas are sweet, while the palate is light and graced by easygoing cherry and raspberry flavors. A little bit pointed and sharp in feel, but good in a citrusy sort of way.",Esencia Valdemar Rosé,85,8,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Garnacha,Bodegas Valdemar
127770,Spain,"Concentrated to the hilt, with molten black fruit, coconut and mint aromas. The palate is driven, tannic, pure and features dynamite flavors of black fruit, bitter chocolate and spice cake. So beautiful and big, but also showing elegance and restraint. Drinkable now but will age well for another seven years or more.",Old Vines Unfiltered,96,82,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Remírez de Ganuza
127775,Spain,"What a beauty! Masculine aromas of black fruits, cola and oak sit there begging to be sipped, while the lush, deep palate is home to dense blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors. Lively but dense, with tannins, plenty of oak and a finish of black pepper, fudge and vanilla. Complex and exciting Spanish wine. Needs time; best from 2012 through 2018.",NA,95,50,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Red Blend,Dominio de Atauta
127790,Spain,"A rich, bacony, black fruit monster with deep, molten flavors and immense body and tannic grab. A bruising wine with boysenberry, blackberry, mint, licorice and chocolate for primary flavors, and then lemony oak as a backdrop. Young, tannic and wild now; best from 2011 through 2015.",Torre Muga,94,96,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Muga
127801,Spain,"Sort of generic and oily on the nose, with white-fruit aromas that don't fully register. The palate is both spongy and spritzy, with dry, soft flavors of melon and papaya. More fluffy and lush than zesty and precise.",NA,86,14,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Valdelainos
127807,Spain,"Waxy on the nose, with buttercup, creamy yellow-fruit scents and white flowers. The palate is wet, racy and a touch like soda, with sweet, candied flavors of peach and melon. Plods along with good enough acidity to support the wine's core sweetness and candied qualities.",NA,86,15,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Chardonnay,Viñas del Vero
127810,Spain,"Starts with distinct, hard aromas of mustard, horseradish and jerky. In the mouth, it's full, bullish and tannic, with flavors of bacon, wood resin, smoke and stewed blackberry. Very smoky and dark, with hard tannins, and just not as good as past vintages.",Deyo,85,17,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Merlot,Castillo de Monjardin
127821,Spain,"Unusual in that this cava hails from the Ribera del Duero region, where red wines are 99.9% of the show. For a no-dosage nature, it's properly crisp and dry, almost like a liquid version of a soda cracker. There are some holes in the fabric but overall it's citrusy, tight and only mildly bitter on the finish.",Peñalba López Brut Nature,85,16,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Finca Torremilanos
127828,Spain,"Bold, forward and extracted red wine, with raspberry, earth, compost and a light leafiness to the nose. Tannic and tight, with plum and heavy, ripe berry flavors. Toasty and dark on the finish too, with power and freshness.",Tinto,85,12,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Alidis
127862,Spain,"Aromas of rubber, smoked beef, syrupy berry and buttery oak are inviting enough, while the palate has edgy acidity that pushes the wine's black cherry element while cutting an obvious oak dosage. Accents of tea, herbs and spice give it character; finishes with an obvious kick of butter and resin.",NA,87,28,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto Fino,Emilio Moro
127866,Spain,"A little saucy and leathery on the nose, but there's also licorice, blackberry and woody aromas to ponder. Flush and well composed on the palate, with plum, raspberry and mild salty, savory notes. Finishes with good feel but a slight herbal taste of tomato and/or oregano.",Crianza,87,30,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Qumrán
127868,Spain,"Bursts with bright, linear cherry and raspberry aromas and flavors, but it's not caustic, sharp or grating. Acidity at peak power yields a zesty, racy personality while a blanket of vanilla flavor softens the cherry and raspberry fruit. Crisp and a good food wine.",Crianza,87,22,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Vallobera
127878,Spain,"Dark purple in color, with can't-miss aromas of prune and raisin. The palate is predictably soft, with manageable heft but low acidity and thus very soft edges. Flavors of baked black fruits are warm but short, and the oak is plentiful. A little too ripe and raisiny to rate higher.",Predicador,86,37,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Benjamin Romeo
127880,Spain,"Nice value red wine with solid black fruit aromas, licorice and crushed mineral notes. It's flush and showing good volume, and the plum/berry core flavors have a vanilla accent.

127891,Spain,"We would not have expected anything to match the stellar 2004 San Román, but this newest vintage is up to the task. It's opaque as midnight without a moon, and the nose is a delectable blend of vanilla, spice, hickory, mocha and meaty blackberry. The palate is both magnetic and sly; it pumps black fruit galore, but augments things with controlled chocolate and spice. Finishes a mile long, with cream, intensity and guile. This wine does not mess around. Best from 2010–2016.",San Román,95,67,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Maurodos
127951,Spain,"A little bit off balance, with mild compost and earth on the nose giving way to an angular palate with pointed acids along with flavors of zesty berries and red apple skins.",Crianza,84,21,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Dios Ares
128041,Spain,"Heavy, dark, candied and jammy, with a hint of licorice to the nose. The palate is chunky and concentrated, with meaty berry flavors and a dose of chocolate. Short on the finish, yet fruity if a bit flat.",Spada,85,13,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Bodegas Fariña
128170,Spain,"Grassy and pungent, with lime, citrus and white pepper on the nose. Tangy and simple across the palate, with basic pineapple and passion fruit flavors. Good but thins out on the finish, leaving leftover acidity.",NA,86,15,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Mania
128184,Spain,"Lean, focused cherry and raspberry aromas properly portend a snappy, fresh, edgy palate of semitart red plum and raspberry flavors. Buttery oak brings some softness, while the finish is a bit hot and high in acid. More traditional in style than modern.",Crianza,86,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Luis Cañas
128211,Spain,"Excelencia is a great wine that offers a lot of character beyond just bold fruit and body. This is by far the best El Albar that the Lurtons have made; it features citrus peel, sexy berry fruit and baking spices on the nose, and then sweet berry, black plum, spice and warmth on the palate. It's powerful as a Toro wine should be, but not tannic or harsh. A monster with a smile; drink now and over the next 5–8 years.",El Albar Excelencia,93,42,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,J. & F. Lurton
128251,Spain,Opens with candied berry and salinic aromas. It's tough in its youth and also a little too funky to inspire much confidence for the future. Toughness in tannins; toughness in fruit; quite peppery on the finish. It just isn't that inviting.,Barrica,84,18,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Martín Berdugo
128254,Spain,"Light on the nose, with nondistinct but fairly fresh fruit aromas. The palate is tangy and shows a combo of red apple and citrus flavors. Finishes with pink grapefruit pith and cleansing acids.",NA,84,9,Catalonia,Tarragona,NA,Rosé,Nostrada
128312,Spain,"Light on the nose, with dilute red-berry aromas and mild leathery, cheesy notes. The palate is kind of raw and lean, with tangy, crisp flavors of pie cherry and raspberry. Dry, peppery, snappy wine, with definitive crispness.",Crianza,85,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Vaza
128330,Spain,"Pale and low on bead, but if you like a Moscato-style wine, this isn't bad at all. The palate is sweet, fleshy and smooth, with lychee and melon flavors. Lively but easy on the finish, with a final wave of lychee fruit and Malvasia-driven sweetness. Unusual but pretty good.",Spumante,85,9,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
128460,Spain,"An improvement from recent years, but that may be a reflection of when we're tasting the wine. At this point in time it's showing dusty plum and raspberry aromas and good body weight. The flavors of raspberry and cherry are solid, while the finish is cleansing. Beyond palatable; it's really a nice rosé from Tempranillo.",Rosado,86,12,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Vilano
128462,Spain,"For a large-production, simple red wine, this Garnacha-Syrah blend is good. The nose features red licorice candy, cherry and raisin aromas, while the palate is round, fairly smooth in feel, and tastes of bright red fruits and milk chocolate.",NA,86,9,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Garnacha-Syrah,Monasterio de las Viñas
128468,Spain,"A little heat on the nose is acceptable given that the remaining cherry and plum aromas are pure. A bit acidic on the palate but staunchly fresh, with good fruit flavor in the red plum category. Cleansing due to higher acidity, with hints of mocha and mineral.",NA,86,10,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Grenache,Quo
128488,Spain,"Opens with tight black cherry and raspberry aromas, but also a whiff of pine and chemical. The palate is round, full and tannic, with snappy berry flavors accented by balasmic notes, oak resin and vanilla. Finishes with traditional vanilla-dill notes and a slight stemminess.",Crianza,86,23,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Abadía la Arroyada
128498,Spain,"With Matallana, you must pay for your pleasure. But pleasurable it is. The nose is a splendid blend of licorice, baking spices, cassis and black plum. The approach is neither quiet nor loud, but well-spoken. It pumps forth huge black cherry and plum fruit, but offsets any raw size with tobacco, herb, coffee and other subtleties. A touch hard now but should soften with a couple of years aging. Best from 2010–2013.",Matallana,93,145,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Telmo Rodríguez
128501,Spain,"Smoky, dark and alluring is how this modern-leaning Rioja starts out. The nose is meaty and ultraripe, but balanced. And so is the palate, which shows flavors of blackberry, cassis, tobacco, cola and coffee. The finish is cuddly and long, with a splinter of coconut and lots of spice. A “racimo” in Spanish is a bunch, so the name refers to the three or so grape bunches that each vine produces.",Hiru 3 Racimos,93,118,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Luis Cañas
128513,Spain,"Sometimes less is more, and with Figuero's wines the shorter the time spent in oak the more amplified the fruit. This crianza, like its sibling from 2005, is textured and totally sound. The nose is plump and intensely fruity, while the palate has a fine but racy feel and flavors of blackberry, plum, chocolate and cola. Long and layered on the finish, and pure. Drink now through 2011.",Tinto Figuero 12 Crianza,92,29,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,García Figuero
128556,Spain,"If you catch this wine young and properly chilled, it isn't that bad. It's very sweet and sugary, with candied melon, mango and citrus flavors. Then it gets more tropical on the finish, with ending notes of banana and mango. On the verge of tasting fake but not quite.",Satinela Medium-Sweet,84,9,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Marqués de Cáceres
128563,Spain,"Hot and earthy, with herbal aromas sitting in front of a hard, grabby palate. The flavors show more plum skin and sourness than sweet, ripe juice. Hence the wine is narrow and fairly astringent. On the plus side, it seems natural and typical for what Cariñena produces.",No. IV,83,22,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Red Blend,Gabarda
128564,Spain,"Despite a fairly positive bouquet, the mouthfeel is tight and the flavor profile is narrow. Sheer across the palate with hard cherry and mild citrus flavors. There's no shortage of tannin either on this young red.",No. II,83,14,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Red Blend,Gabarda
128625,Spain,"Floral, earthy, funky and barnyardy, with all the young exuberance that comes with joven/roble wines from RDD. Lots of color, power, tannins and extract along with young, sweet, chewy black-fruit flavors and tart acidity to the palate.",Roble,84,15,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Qumrán
128627,Spain,"Hot earth, baked cherry and mild vanilla aromas come in front of a snappy, angular palate with tangy pie-cherry and red-plum flavors. Sheer and basic Rioja with high acidity, lean fruit, a cleansing finish and a light body.",Crianza,84,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Montecillo
128632,Spain,"Smells oily and a little burnt and acrid, with fleshy flavors of banana, melon and bitter pith. Has some verve but mostly it's an average wine with some bitterness and dry orange peel and pith. Decent but offers nothing beyond.",Hermanos Lurton,84,13,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,J. & F. Lurton
128633,Spain,"Lively, candied and medicinal, with grassy aromas along with mild animal notes. The palate is young, grabby, forceful but solid, while the flavors are bright, bold, snappy and suggest red plum and black cherry. A basic young wine that's decent if you're not too discerning.",Viñas de Olivara,84,9,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Marqués de Olivara
128710,Spain,"Warm and rich wine, with big black cherry, raspberry, vanilla and cedary aromas. Well-oaked if nothing else, with mixed red fruits, black plum and a ton of vanilla on the palate. Lovely texture and stoutly structured, and the finish is full but soft, with dry spice and even more vanilla. Drink now through 2014.",Malleolus,92,50,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,Emilio Moro
128716,Spain,"Pure, soft, balanced and classy, with raisin, earth and fine leather on the nose. The palate is warm and smooth, with lasting acidity that creates juicy cherry, plum and fresh tomato flavors. On the finish, chocolate and caramel enter the picture. Complex and still vital. Drink now through 2013.",Reserva,92,78,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Val Sotillo
128805,Spain,"Warm, baked aromas smell of clay and raisin, and later a wave of minty green enters the picture. The palate is sort of lean, with some holes in the fabric, while flavors of wild berry and black fruits fold in a heavier note of molasses. Limited in its virtues; short in complexity.",NA,85,25,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinta Fina,Conde de San Cristóbal
128806,Spain,"A little dusty and spicy on the nose, with pear and apple checking in. The palate has spritz and acidity, while the flavors run sweet with ripe apple, pineapple and tropical fruit. Tastes like orange candy on the finish, with a sugary lasting impression. Good but needs more balance and harmony.",Capricho Val de Paxariñas,85,24,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Godello,Gancedo
128817,Spain,"Dark and powerfully oaked despite its 5-month pedigree. Mint, tar, shoe polish and blackberry work the bouquet, while the palate is structured and tight but also quite dark and woody. Mocha, butter and pepper flavors carry the finish on this healthy and structured wine that may also be too oaky for its own benefit.",5 Meses en Barrica,85,13,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Monteabellón
128853,Spain,"Old wines are not easy to appreciate, so we'd almost rather have you judge this wine. In our opinion, it's way too sour and lacking in fruit to justify rave reviews. Thirty years of age doesn't seem to have helped it, and what's left is sherried and pruny, yet with sharp acidity.",Castillo Ygay Gran Reserva Especial,83,225,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Marqués de Murrieta
128858,Spain,"Rather minty and herbal up front, with grassy, field-like aromas overriding the red fruit that wants to peek through. The palate offers only secondary fruit flavors that turn to cider if given time. Acceptable but doesn't offer much.",Mercedes Eguren Rosé,83,13,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bodegas Eguren
128868,Spain,"Past its prime. The nose is heavy and the palate deals minimal peach flavors. It's wet but losing clarity, with bland apple and pear flavors left on the finish. This is not quite dead but best to wait for 2007.",NA,83,20,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Castro Baroña
128920,Spain,"A bit flat and jammy on the nose, and then it runs hot and heavy across the palate, where the flavors waver between citric and plum-cherry. There's a lot of fruit here, but also some burn and finally a dull hum to the finish.",NA,84,9,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Tienen Duende
128928,Spain,"Earthy but sharp on the nose, with a foreboding sense of stem and sourness. The palate is indeed raw and acidic, with lean, slightly stemmy flavors of herbs, raspberry and plum. Not bad but carries a stemmy, less-than-pure personality.",Reserva,84,14,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Campo Viejo
128938,Spain,"A rubbery, minty, jammy wine, with a mildly candied, gummy feel and sweet, modest, lightly green flavors that suggest red fruits. The finish is decent but herbal and sweet.",Viña Main,84,14,Central Spain,Vinos de Madrid,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Orusco
129036,Spain,"Opaque and nearly over the top, with concentrated, roasted aromas of baked blackberry and dark plums. Super big and weighty, with driving flavors and some of the same lemony oak displayed by the Torre Muga 2005. Finishes in a mass of fudge, black olive and roasted berries. Hold until 2011–12, then drink.",Aro,92,205,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Muga
129048,Spain,"About as big and ripe as they come before tilting to the other side. Aromas of prune, raisin, marzipan, leather and baked berry fruit are sweet and inviting, while the loaded, tannic palate deals big berry flavors, tea and spice. Mint and coconut grace the pusling, stocked finish. Drink from 2012 thru 2015.",NA,91,37,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Remelluri
129065,Spain,"Joan Simó had great success in 2005. This wine is excellent and the higher-end Les Eres is outstanding, so bottom line: buy Simó from 2005. Getting back to Sentius, a so-called “second” wine, it is dark, sexy, smooth and shows true Priorat accents of schist, coffee, cola and berry aromas. The flavors are flashy and fresh, with mammoth black cherry, plum and coffee virtually jumping from the glass. A very deep and balanced wine to drink now through 2013.",Sentius,92,43,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Joan Simó
129085,Spain,"Melis is a project backed by wine industry folks from California, but this blend of old-vines Grenache along with Carignan, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon is very European. It's heady but well balanced, with smooth edges and not too much fiery attitude, roughness or scratchy tannins. It's forward and big-boned, but there's enough creamy richness to make it friendly. Needs plenty of air time now; should hold well for five-plus years.",Melis,92,99,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Cellers Melis
129097,Spain,"Racy red wine, with mild bramble and brine aromas to go with spunky cherry-plum flavors. Quite zesty, bright and juicy, but solidly put together and not overly acidic. Even shows a distant chocolaty side, which is not uncommon for young Garnacha.",Cinco Josés - 5 Joes Old Vine,85,8,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Bodegas Aragonesas
129108,Spain,"No one says Verdejo is an ager, but this '08 is fading. The nose is soft and peachy, with weight and vanilla. The palate is equally soft and melony, and the green-fruit flavors are starting to turn mealy. Still good enough, but without much spunk it might be better to wait for 2009.",Fuente Elvira,85,15,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Pedro Escudero
129109,Spain,"How many $5 wines are this good? Not many. The nose is zesty and aggressive but settles and doesn't offend, while the juicy, fresh palate has bright cherry and raspberry flavors. Basic, ripe, clean red wine.",Abrazo del Toro,85,5,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Syrah,Abrazo
129118,Spain,"Aromas of medicinal berry, sucking candy, rhubarb and raspberry are a touch gawky, but the snappy palate of blueberry and boysenberry is good.

129178,Spain,"Given the high level at which Rioja is running these days, this green wine with aromas of pole beans and tobacco ash just isn't up to standards. Balance and elegance are nowhere to be found.",Añada,81,NA,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Lar de Paula
129214,Spain,"A bit tan and dull to the eye, with neutral aromas of apple cider and peach. The palate is wet, uncomplicated and simple, with basic apple flavors that some might consider to be bland. Solid on the finish, with papaya for flavor.",NA,84,8,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Viura-Chardonnay,Vega Sindoa
129362,Spain,"Sensational for the price. This die-hard bargain is loaded with berry richness, sweet pulp, coconut and balance. It's a little creamy, but generous and integrated. Smells, tastes and finishes like something that costs three times more.",Crianza,91,13,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Condado de Oriza
129363,Spain,"Youthful on the nose, with aromatic hints of fine aged cheese and leather blended with earthy berry fruit. The palate is firm and tannic, but not hard. And the flavors of sweet berries, black plum and vanilla are hugely appealing. Coffee, berry essence and a certain chewiness define the finish. An excellent wine with regional expression that will be at its best in a couple of years.",Tinto Figuero 12 Crianza,91,29,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,García Figuero
129368,Spain,"Quite well-oaked, which is the house style for Lanzaga. There's darkness, vanilla, char, leather and a bed of black fruit. The palate has a tight but nice feel to it, with fine tannic structure propping up plum, blackberry and chocolate flavors. Some expected mocha and coffee work the finish, but mostly it closes long and natural. For modern Rioja, this is well built and satisfying.",Lanzaga,91,34,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Telmo Rodríguez
129373,Spain,"Since Torres launched Celeste a few years ago, the wine has gotten better and better with each passing vintage. The 2006 is friendly and complete, with no outlying or iffy aromas or flavors. This is textbook Ribera; it has smoothness and size along with intriguing black cherry, plum, herbs, tea and tobacco. A bottling for pretty much any wine lover.",Celeste Crianza,91,24,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Torres
129375,Spain,"A tiny production wine with class and style. It's toasty and dark, with bold black cherry and cassis aromas offset by ample minerality. From the town of Torroja, this 233-case wine is full of molasses, black cherry and other rich, brandied flavors. And it finishes warm, with caramel, coffee and other major-league attributes. Hold until 2010, if possible.",NA,91,75,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Terroir Al Límit Soc. Lda.
129376,Spain,"First time we've rated this Albariño, and we love it, especially for the price. It's lightly honeyed on the nose, with accents of white pepper and peach.

129381,Spain,"Figuero's top wine is more than fine. The nose begins with meaty, leathery notes and backs them up with spice and ripe fruit. The palate is not flabby or fat; instead it's racy and features good acidity that pushes raspberry, tea, tobacco and nutmeg flavors. A more agile wine than many from this famed region. Should age well for five to ten years.",Figuero Noble,91,131,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,García Figuero
129384,Spain,"Linear, strapping and tight in style, with a keen focus on wiry red-berry fruit. There's a ton of cherry on the nose, and it's definitely natural and pure, with dry raspberry flavors and a solid finish. Firm, structured and delivers a real taste of the Priorat. Not overextracted; good with food. Drink now through 2012.",Elix,91,50,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Cellers Melis
129386,Spain,"A delicious wine that's entirely impressive in the way it delivers smooth, subtle citrus and honey aromas in front of a generous but controlled palate of tangerine, apple, lemon and spice. A luxurious, smooth experience, with a sexy mouthfeel and finely integrated acidity. Expensive for Albariño, but fewer than 3,000 cases were produced.",Selección,91,29,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Adegas D'Altamira

129411,Spain,"An unusual wine made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Tempranillo, Syrah and Merlot. It's floral but underdeveloped, with volatility and stunted fruit.

Shows flashes but it doesn't dance in the mouth.",Leva Daniel's,85,42,Levante,Alicante,NA,Red Blend,Joaquín Gálvez Bauzá
129413,Spain,"A consistent wine from year to year that's made in a friendly, mass-appeal style. It's not so pungent and citrusy like some Verdejo; instead it's more peachy, sweet and melony. Soft on the finish but with just enough acidity to get it through the year.",NA,85,10,Central Spain,Tierra de Castilla,NA,Verdejo,Tapeña

Inoffensive but more generic than individual.",NA,85,22,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Red Blend,Atalayas de Golbán
129417,Spain,"Nectarine and citrus aromas are solid, while the palate is more racy, sharp and linear than some, with narrow, semisour flavors of lemon and orange.

129518,Spain,"Bright and shimmers with purple, while the nose is jumpy and candied, with a lot of sweetness and black fruit.

129523,Spain,"Generally speaking, most Amontillados are good at their worst, but for whatever reason this wine barely makes the grade. It lacks pop on the nose and seems dilute and drab.

Made from Pinot Noir.",Aria Brut,82,14,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Pinot Noir,Segura Viudas

130044,Spain,"Almost red in color, with sweet, juicy aromas of red fruits that bring to mind Beaujolais Nouveau. The palate is fairly unctuous for a rosado, with thick flavors of red apples, berry pie and sweet butter. For a fuller-bodied dry pink wine, it's pretty hefty stuff.",Rosé,85,16,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon,1+1=3
130207,Spain,"Full-bodied and pushing up against raisiny and baked, but it draws back at the final moment and competently settles into its richness and ripeness. Generous and dark in the mouth, with meaty tannins and flavors of black raspberry, plum and mocha. On the finish, there's a hint of fresh tomato to go with vanilla and leftover berries. Drink now through 2013.",Reserva Unfiltered,90,30,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Muga
130216,Spain,"Spicy and dark smelling, with aromas of tar, blackberry and earth. The palate has fine feel and flow to it, while the flavors are interesting and juicy, with an emphasis on spiced berry fruit and nutmeg. Long and graceful on the finish. Drink now; it's ready.",Reserva,90,25,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Viña Arnáiz
130250,Spain,"Jammy, creamy and superripe, with raspberry, burnt toast and coffee on the thick, meaty nose. Flavors reminiscent of an ice cream sundae work the palate, which means berry syrup, chocolate sauce and vanilla are highly prominent. Texturally speaking, this is a smooth, soft and plush wine. It pushes the envelope on ripeness, but that's become the Cirsion way. An awesome wine that deserves a proper decanting.",Cirsion,96,303,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Roda
130267,Spain,"Ripe and rich, with some prune on the nose; it shows a good mix of berry and earth characteristics in front of a mildly oaky finish that holds its form. Sort of heavy and overripe but still pretty good. Drink now.",Fontal Crianza,85,6,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Fontana
130268,Spain,"Big and sun-baked, with large berry aromas and flavors that come up nice but a touch hollow. Ample acidity ensures that the wine doesn't register as dull, but in the long run there isn't much substance to it; there's color, flavor and tannins but no individuality.",Altos de la Hoya,85,11,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Bodegas Olivares
130285,Spain,"Scattered and fading, this soft white features candied aromas in front of mango and cantaloupe flavors. Lacks snap and pop, as it finishes with a soft feel and a strong taste of banana pudding.",NA,84,13,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,White Blend,Hermanos Lurton
130385,Spain,"This is showing mineral, saline, spice, peach and melon—all good signs. The palate leans toward tropical, with pineapple leading the way. With no surprises, it finishes clean and a touch fleshy. An excellent Albariño that's maturing quickly. Drink now.",Dona Rosa,90,18,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Adega Martínez Serantes
130396,Spain,"A unique take on Manzanilla Sherry, which is often light and sea-flecked but in this case is more amber, hazy and full. The nose is racy and spicy, while the palate offers dried apricots, orange peel and salt. Finishes with tang offsetting hazelnut and walnut notes. Oily, interesting and very good if you are a Sherry fan.",Manzanilla,90,10,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L.
130398,Spain,"Spicy and a little woody on the bouquet, with ripe black-fruit aromas, a speck of mineral and a touch of cough drop. This is Torres' first commercial Priorat wine, and it's not a tannic specimen, yet the raspberry and dark-fruit flavors are sound and tasty. Finishes smooth, with a beam of acidity keeping it in balance. Drink now or at any time over the next few years.",Salmos,90,32,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Torres
130405,Spain,"Dark and definitely not reserved, this is a big blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Petit Verdot that pours on the rich blackberry, cola, chocolate and smoke character. A lot of powerful new oak backs it all up, leaving espresso bitterness and mocha sweetness on the finish. A modern wine with ample lushness.",Emeritus,90,90,Central Spain,Dominio de Valdepusa,NA,Red Blend,Marques de Griñon
130409,Spain,"Overall this Callet-led blend might exceed its more oaked, richer brother known as Son Negre. Àn has a rooty, oak-driven nose with hints of herbs and tobacco, while the palate is dark and tasty, with blackberry, cherry and cured meat flavors. Finishes with pepper and a lash of leftover oak that hopefully will disappear as the wine ages. Drink now through 2012.",Àn,89,53,Spanish Islands,Vi de la Terra Illes Balears,NA,Red Blend,Ànima Negra
130502,Spain,"Dark fruit, rubber band, bacon and floral aromas give this go-to Rioja a modern outlook and a convincing bouquet. Solid, juicy and tight in the mouth, with flavors of lifted black cherry, cassis, plum, mocha and vanilla. A healthy wine that just makes the level of excellence. Drink now through 2013.",Reserva,90,28,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Sierra Cantabria
130514,Spain,"Almost impossible to distinguish this nice and easy Garnacha from the winery's Monte Oton label (also rated 89). Open berry and jam aromas keep it together, while the saturated, sweet blackberry palate is living proof of Campo de Borja's sun and terroir. Ripe, deep and easy to enjoy.",NA,89,8,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Red Blend,Borsao
130657,Spain,"Garnacha is the lead in this five-grape blend, and overall it shows almost all of what's good about Catalonian wine. The nose offers sweet cherry and a whiff of hard dried cheese; the palate is racy at first and then thickens as blackberry, red licorice and fig flavors take over. A steady wine.",Selecció Vinyes Velles,89,19,Northern Spain,Emporadà-Costa Brava,NA,Red Blend,Martí Fabra
130670,Spain,"Plenty of new oak is announced via aromas of coconut, mint, vanilla and burnt toast. but offsetting that is lively berry and cola flavors. As it opens and settles in, you get a wall of fierce tannins that aren't likely to fade any time soon. So unless you have years to cellar this wine, it will likely hold onto its hard, tannic personality. Hold another three years, if possible.",Reserva Real,89,150,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Torres
130761,Spain,"Termanthia is the pinnacle of Tinta de Toro. Aromas of wild blackberry, crude oil, forest floor and truffles are just now showing themselves, while the tight, tannic palate is full of black plum, blackberry and bitter chocolate flavors. Espresso and roast meat notes grace the dark, jam-packed finish, and as a whole this is one bold, boisterous wine. Best in 2011 thru 2013. Only 531 cases.",Termanthia,95,200,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Numanthia
130802,Spain,"Having never tried this Viura-Malvasia blend before, we say it's nicely done. The nose rings of baked apple and deftly applied oak, while the palate is fresh but also deep and textured. Flavors of apple and pear are accented by vanilla and toast, and overall it's composed and shows character. Drink now through 2012. Only 250 cases made.",1894,89,50,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Cosme Palacio y Hermanos
130809,Spain,"Despite its age, you can still smell sawdust, dry oak and resin on the nose. The palate is acidic and drying, with tight plum, cola and raspberry flavors. The finish warms up some, with caramel and roasted fruit notes. Nice and tasty, and ready to drink now through 2011.",Miros de Ribera Reserva,89,65,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Peñafiel
130810,Spain,"Dark in color, with density, concentration, oak and black fruit aromas.

Satisfying, slightly complex and with good snap.",El Bon Homme,89,18,Levante,Valencia,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Rafael Cambra
130831,Spain,"A top-flight Toro that knows how to step on the gas but keep the car centered. Aromas of dried lavender, violets, coffee and black fruit come together marvelously, while the palate is dark as Mud Cake but still loaded with tasty blackberry and black currants. Pure and strapping, and giving all the oomph that Toro is known for.",Élite,93,38,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Muruve
130835,Spain,"Potent and raring to go, with lots of young oak and intense fruit that causes the wine to change in the glass in the blink of an eye. What we can tell at this early point of development is that it is saturated, healthy, balanced and clean. There's vibrancy and full tannins, with lip-smacking acidity. Already a good one to ponder, but should be even better from 2009–2011. Just 750 cases made.",Vendimia Seleccionada,93,48,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Amador Garcia
130838,Spain,"The Lui & William bodega is behind this outstanding Tempranillo from Toro. The wine shows a brilliant violet tint in front of intense, inky aromas of black cherry and chocolate cake. The palate is superripe and bucks like a bronco; the tannins are dense and form titanic structure, and the finish of coffee and spice hints at a fine cigar. It's a huge load at 15%, so be prepared.",Lui Selection,93,27,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Abelis Carthago
130889,Spain,"Beautifully composed, with power and just as much precision and pizzazz. The nose offers lightly baked berry fruit notes, leather and spice, while the palate is loaded with tobacco, exotic spices and the finest natural berry flavors Spain has to offer. Smooth, elegant, finessed and potent, with integrated tannins and bold acidity that will keep it going for at least a decade. Drink from 2012 through 2018.",Malleolus de Valderramiro,97,180,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto Fino,Emilio Moro
130950,Spain,"This wine is made from old-vines Verdejo and it shows more minerality and intensity than something made from younger grapes. The nose has wax, mineral and citrus aromas, while the palate shows passion fruit and pineapple flavors. Grows on you nicely with structure, acidity and a smack of Rueda terroir.",Finca la Colina Cien X Cien,89,23,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Vinos Sanz
130963,Spain,"The gold tint may look imposing, and it does signal a richer-styled wine. But let this heavier, more ripe Albariño roll over your palate and you'll probably wind up liking its citrus and nectarine flavors but softer body. Finishes with apricot, kumquat and vanilla notes. An interesting wine to drink now.",Premium,89,17,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Valdumia
131096,Spain,"Dense and dark, with huge black-fruit aromas, toasty oak, chocolate and balsamic notes. Numanthia is ripe, rugged and intense, with in-your-face black fruit, coffee and burnt-toast accents. The feel and finish are deep as a cool well, and smooth as a whistle. Masculine to the max, and pretty close to being ready to drink. Best to hold until the fall or winter. 12,000 cases made.",Numanthia,93,60,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Numanthia
131120,Spain,"An earthy, bulky wine with aromas of saddle leather, crushed spice and raisin. The palate is snappier than the bouquet, as blackberry and plum fruit show accents of dill, herbs, leather and soy sauce. A legitimate, muscular Rioja made in the so-called modern style. Drink now through 2014.",Jarrarte,89,33,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Abel Mendoza
131121,Spain,"On the spot and sweet, with black cherry and roundness on the nose. Plays above its price league via ripe plum and berry flavors, bounce, body and build. Whole, concentrated and shows good structure, depth and character. About as good as inexpensive Garnacha gets.",Monte Oton,89,7,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Borsao
131125,Spain,"Floral and sweet on the front side of the nose and more dark, grilled and coffee-like on the back end. The palate is more juicy and snappy than some, with no shortage of acidity. Tastes of live-wire cherry and plum, with a long, driving finish. Needs time to settle; drink in late 2010.",Crianza,89,30,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Vilano
131130,Spain,"Big, meaty and broad, with thick, masculine coal, pepper and blackberry aromas. This marks a nice comeback for Abadia Retuerta, which had some weak wines in 2002 and '03; this single-vineyard Syrah is lush, loaded and bursting with char, chocolate and deep fruit. It has size, power and balance pulling it in the right direction. Probably better in another year or so.",Pago Garduña,93,110,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Syrah,Abadia Retuerta
131151,Spain,"In 2001 (the best Rioja vintage prior to 2004) this wine cost $15 and rated 87 points. Now it's $42 and it's worth it. Smooth and inviting on the nose, with coconut, toast and black fruit aromas. In a word, the bouquet is inviting. And the palate seals the deal; there's a creamy feel and loads of fruit and vanilla to fill the gaps. Drink now through 2009.",Hacienda de Susar,92,42,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Red Blend,Marqués de la Concordia
131152,Spain,"This is far and away the best Mirto of all time. It's ripe and brawny, with bacon and black-fruit aromas that put it squarely into the Nuevo Classic mold. In the mouth, licorice and nutmeg flavors give character to smooth blackberry and dark plum flavors, while the finish is cushioned, herbal and long. Immediately appealing but with five to ten years of aging potential.",Mirto,92,65,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Ramón Bilbao
131155,Spain,"Complex and showing so much of what we love about Ribera del Duero. Baking spices, mature fruit and leather grace the stately bouquet, while the palate sings a pretty tune of berries, plum and brown sugar. There's thrust and potency to the mouthfeel but also a toasty, rich, mocha character. Drinking good now but should hold in there for another five to eight years.",Gran Reserva,92,75,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Alidis
131165,Spain,"Talk about magnetic aromas of bacon, tobacco and bold black fruit, and then comes an oak-rich palate full of coconut, butter, chocolate and exotic berry flavor.

131185,Spain,"Make room in the cellar for this heavyweight! Talk about a monster wine; but there's also finesse, character and style to it. Alabaster is the top wine from the Eguren family's new Toro winery, and it's big, tannic and loaded with spice, molasses and syrupy black fruit flavors. Rich, long and fierce on the finish, with tannins and heat to resolve. Best from 2012 through 2020.",Alabaster,94,250,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Teso La Monja
131250,Spain,"Mallorca gives us this ripe but intriguing mix of Mantonegro, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. The new oak on the nose is plentiful, and along with that there's asphalt and marshmallow. The palate is full with berry and plum flavors, and there's a fleshy and plump character to the finish. A worthy wine from off the beaten path.",Sió,88,31,Spanish Islands,Vi de la Terra Illes Balears,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Herederos Ribas
131253,Spain,"Ripe plum and berry aromas are on the soft and cuddly side, but have some spunk. The palate on this classic Garnacha-Craignan-Syrah blend is adequately juicy and fresh, with a basket's worth of berry flavor. And the finish is complementary and offers some chocolate as an aftertaste. Drink now and over the next two years.",Gran Sangre de Toro,88,15,Catalonia,Catalunya,NA,Red Blend,Torres
131254,Spain,"Youthful and exuberant, with a generous blend of lead pencil, molasses and plum/berry aromas. Torres got the perfect level of ripeness and balance in this favorable vintage, and thus this is probably as good a Merlot as you're ever going to see from the Penedès. It's full and just sweet enough. Drink now through 2010.",Atrium,88,16,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Merlot,Torres
131263,Spain,"Darker and a touch more stewy than the winery's less pricey old-vines effort. Airing loosens it up, but throughout it's a big, stewy wine with extracted blackberry and coffee cake flavors. The finish is equally on the rich side, with swirling toffee and coffee afternotes. It's a big wine with heft but also some chunkiness.",Masia Carreras,88,37,Northern Spain,Emporadà-Costa Brava,NA,Red Blend,Cellar Marti Fabra Carreras
131272,Spain,"Dark as night, with forceful aromas of root beer, menthol, warm earth and baked fruits. Maybe it's a bit soft and widespread given the heat of 2003, but if flesh and fruit turn you on and the lack of complexity isn't too disconcerting, it's a fine modern Syrah. Good with bacon burgers, steak off the grill, etc.",Estate Bottled,88,45,Central Spain,Dominio de Valdepusa,NA,Syrah,Marques de Griñon
131362,Spain,"Dark, rubbery and focused on the nose, while the palate is wider, richer and propped up by a band of zesty acidity. The flavors are typical of Toro, meaning dark blackberry and boysenberry. A finish of brandied berries, kirsch and chocolate is almost like dessert.",Termes,92,30,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Numanthia
131364,Spain,"Astrales has really nailed it the past couple of years, and while the '06 isn't quite as good as 2005, it's still an excellent wine. Blackberry, tobacco and cocoa aromas lead into a stacked flavor profile of boysenberry and plum. And on the finish it expands and brings vanilla and fudge into play. Drink now and over the next six years.",NA,92,67,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Astrales
131412,Spain,"Despite some spearmint and Band-Aid on the nose, this ready-to-drink wine shows good quality from head to toe. The palate is on the lighter side, with nice acidity pushing smacky, lively red plum and raspberry flavors. Hints of tomato and citrus fruits also get into play.",Crianza,88,18,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Darien
131444,Spain,"Powerful and precise, but with a cloudy color. On the nose and in the mouth this aged version of the venerable Drysack shows considerable freshness, tang and complexity. It's edgy yet deep, with caramel and mushroom notes going head to head with acidic intensity. Sherry is rarely more balanced than this; it's lively and rich, balanced yet racy.",Drysack Solera Especial Sweet Old Oloroso Aged 15 Years,92,25,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Williams & Humbert
131447,Spain,"For a few years running we've been singing the praises of Abadal, a label from Catalonia that has been producing hit upon hit. This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah from the excellent 2001 vintage is in super form; the wine has a ripe, integrated nose of cocoa, dark fruit and chocolate, while the palate is bold and loaded with vivacious cherry and blackberry flavors. From front to center to back, this wine has it all going in the right direction. Good now through 2012.",Abadal Reserva,92,23,Catalonia,Pla de Bages,NA,Red Blend,Masies d'Avinyo
131466,Spain,"A touch doughy on the nose, with prune and blackberry aromas that are neither pushy nor aggressive. The palate is ripe, rich and just forward enough, with blackberry, wild berry, coffee and fudge flavors. Settles nicely on the finish, and overall this wine shows almost all of what's good about modern Ribera del Duero wines. 250 cases made; drink now through 2015.",Tinto Figuero Noble,93,131,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,García Figuero
131483,Spain,"Outstanding Sherry with complexity, richness and character. The nose has a salinic zest to it, making it no wallflower, and of course there's raisin and prune. The palate is formed, sculpted and balanced, with peanut M&M;'s candy, roasted fruit, chocolate ice cream and more. A beauty with power and poise.",Matusalem Oloroso Dulce Viejo,93,45,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,González Byass
131487,Spain,"This is the tier-two wine from the Egurens' new Toro project, and it's stellar. Intense aromas of black fruit, char and mint start it out, and next up come cola, roasted black fruit, clove and cured-meat flavors. Oak is forward now, but it should settle in a year or so. A dynamite Toro to drink from 2011 through 2018.",Victorino,93,71,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Teso La Monja
131489,Spain,"A wonderfully balanced and giving wine with sweet raisin and prune aromas and an overall richness akin to crude oil. Flavors of baked black plum, brown sugar and molasses are both juicy and rich, and then toffee and mocha take over on the finish. Sweet and thick for sure, but with discernible fruit and vitality.",Noe Viejo,93,45,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Pedro Ximénez,González Byass
131491,Spain,"Spice, herbs, smoked meat and a dark core work in harmony on the bouquet. The palate on this well-made Reserva packs black cherry, cassis and plum, and that's followed by a stylish, smooth finish that comes on buttery at first and then settles in. Doesn't overwhelm but complements food nicely. Tasted twice.",Reserva,90,40,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Conde de la Salceda
131492,Spain,"Very colorful and properly ripe, with lush berry aromas backed by coffee notes. The palate is lush and balanced, with deep blueberry, black cherry and cola notes. A truly committed wine with a smooth, unctuous finish as the final chapter.",NA,90,15,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Syrah,Alceño
131500,Spain,"Starts with roasted, leathery aromas that feature hints of burnt beef and berry compote. The palate is layered and nicely balanced, with berry flavors hitting first and chocolate coming next. Espresso is the final act, as it ties the mouth to the finish in impressive fashion. A big load but one that's still manageable.",Tinto Roble,90,20,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Rejadorada
131550,Spain,"Dusty black cherry and raspberry aromas are true to the variety, and the buttery quality on the palate adds weight and vanilla to the berry and cassis flavors. Overall this is a structured, fairly oaky wine with firm tannins and a toasty finish. Will go well with steak.",Estate Bottled,88,45,Central Spain,Dominio de Valdepusa,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon,Marques de Griñon
131558,Spain,"The earthy brick color and dry fruit aromas announce that this isn't a typical wine. The blend is Merlot, Callet and Syrah, and it hails from the island of Mallorca. The wine is a bit tough and angular, but the plum, raspberry and cherry flavors are tightly formed and fenced in by potent acidity and oak. Interesting but not for everyone.",Negre,88,27,Spanish Islands,Vi de la Terra Illes Balears,NA,Red Blend,Son Bordils
131574,Spain,"Heavily oaked and loaded down with butter and resin, this is a wine for those infatuated with the obscure. The blend is 90% Callet and 10% Fogoneu, and don't ask us to give you the history of these Mallorcan grapes. Suffice it to say that this wine is broad, a bit stewy and very different. It's not heavy like an anchor but it has its chunky shoulder pads to deal with. Only 25 cases made.",Son Negre,88,110,Spanish Islands,Vi de la Terra Illes Balears,NA,Red Blend,Ànima Negra
131603,Spain,"An old-school wine done really well. It starts with cherry, tobacco and light coconut aromas before moving on to juicy boysenberry and citrus flavors that are boosted by CUNE's trademark acids. Muscular, wiry and structured, but with restraints. Think Barry Bonds before Balco.",Imperial Reserva,91,45,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,CVNE
131640,Spain,"The Evo '05 is composed, lively and impressive.

Drink now through 2012.",EVO,92,30,Northern Spain,Ribera del Queiles,NA,Cabernet Blend,Guelbenzu
131715,Spain,"This is Albariño in fine form. The nose is succulent and marble-smooth, with pure citrus and melon aromas.

Drink now.",NA,91,25,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Lusco
131718,Spain,"Big in every way, with tons of new oak, popcorn and coffee sitting on top of dark-fruit aromas. Modern despite its incorporation of several indigenous grapes, this blend delivers a blast of roasted black cherry and plum flavors in front of a resiny finish that's dripping with menthol and molasses. Unique if a touch syrupy; it's clearly shooting for the modern style.",Grans Muralles,91,105,Catalonia,Conca de Barberà,NA,Red Blend,Torres
131720,Spain,"Charcoal, cola and licorice are all components of this wine's dark and meaty nose. And the palate hardly disappoints; there's depth and harmony to the berry, coffee and mocha flavors. It feels good and has just enough kick to keep you thinking. A really nice crianza that will settle and only grow more complex over the next few years.",Crianza,91,24,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Peñagudo
131721,Spain,"A bit of choppy wood announces a fully oaked wine, and yes, it's a touch hard-coated. But underneath the veneer of barrel there's lively red fruit and a natural brambly character. The palate is just acidic enough to be lively, and the finish is healthy and settles upon chocolate due to the wine's generous oaking. Very good mouthfeel and depth make this more than solid. Drink now–2011.",Abadal Selecció,91,49,Catalonia,Pla de Bages,NA,Red Blend,Masies d'Avinyo
131728,Spain,"Honey and corn syrup aromas tell you this is rich, but what you don't realize so easily is how complex and expansive this Muscat is. The flavors of honey, banana and clover start out as sweet and unctuous, but then they unfurl to show depth, complexity and length. In the end you realize that this is all about pure, unrefined power and purity. Drinking it is like a rush of natural sugar to the brain.",Casta Diva Cosecha Miel,91,29,Levante,Alicante,NA,Muscat,Bodegas Gutiérrez de la Vega
131737,Spain,"Hard to believe the price on this. Yes, it's a perfectly good aged Ribera, but special it isn't. Bricky and roasted on the nose, with spiced cherry and plum aromas. The palate is healthy and comfortable, with cola, cherry and licorice flavors. Vanilla and length define the finish. Too regular to recommend at $325.",Prestigio Pago de las Solanas,88,325,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Matarromera
131749,Spain,"Toro is not usually a prime hunting ground for Best Buys, but this full-throttle wine is solid, gritty and tastes and smells nice.

131762,Spain,"Nice, brawny and integrated, with sexy aromas of wild berry, dark plum, leather and earth.

131776,Spain,"Teso la Monja is the new Toro winery from the Eguren family of Rioja fame (former owners of Numanthia-Termes in Toro), and it's proof that no beat has been missed since they sold out to Moët Hennessy. Expect dark, intense black fruit aromas and flavors mixed with heat, tannin, cola and spice. Some oak creeps out on the finish, but overall this is a lovely, bullish Toro.

131797,Spain,"Exemplary Ribera del Duero, given that '02 was not a great year. This wine, however, pours on the richness fans of this region are looking for. The palate is lush and ripe, with deep plum and blackberry flavors supported by mocha and earth shadings. Offers a little bit of everything.",Crianza,90,38,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Convento San Francisco
131808,Spain,"This producer is doing a very good job with its superaffordable, no-dosage cava. The nose is lightly floral, with the accent on apple blossom. The palate is solid and crisp, with appropriate white-fruit flavors. Crisp on the finish, with a lively feel. A pleasurable sipper for sure.",Brut Zero Reserva,89,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Castellblanch
131812,Spain,"A gem in the semisweet category, with touches of melon and banana on the nose. The palate pours on the sweet apple cider and warm citrus, while the finish is on the mark. This is a generous, no-brainer of a bubbly: Just uncork, pour, sip and smile.",Extra Dry,89,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
131814,Spain,"Purple in color, with a sweet, fragrant bouquet featuring mostly plum and strawberry but also a touch of rusticity. Bold and full of cherry-cola flavors, while the feel is downright plush and proper. A very nice (and new to the market) wine from Torres; and there's no knocking its value qualifications.",Malena,89,10,Catalonia,Catalunya,NA,Garnacha,Torres
131865,Spain,"An austere blend of Cab Sauvignon, Syrah and Petit Verdot. There's color and power galore, but also a choppy, firm mouthfeel that guards intense cherry flavors and smoldering oak. An aggressive wine that doesn't back down from its essence. Will do much better with food than by itself.",Estate Bottled Summa Varietalis,87,32,Central Spain,Dominio de Valdepusa,NA,Red Blend,Marques de Griñon
131867,Spain,"Emina is a label under the Matarromera group, and this Rueda white (80% Verdejo and 20% Viura) is light, clean and a touch flowery. But mostly it pumps forth with simple orange and grapefruit qualities along with lemon drops on the finish. Drink now.",NA,87,10,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Emina
131869,Spain,"This is an interesting wine that offers a nice perfume but limited flavors and complexity. So what makes it so interesting, you ask? Well, the fact that it's varietal Petit Verdot from the Duero River Valley, which is not common; that and the fact that it's a mind-boggling $200. The wine itself shows a deep color, vanilla and cocoa flavors, and a range of dark-berry flavors. Elegant and provacative, it's not.",PV Petit Verdot,87,199,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Petit Verdot,Abadia Retuerta
131874,Spain,"Welcome back to the classic off-dry Sherry that helped make the category's reputation. It's amber in color, with toasted almonds, citrus peel and cinnamon on the nose. The mouthfeel is solid and not too overtly sweet, and the finish is coated with burnt brown sugar. Best served on the rocks, or at least with a very good chill.",Drysack Medium,87,15,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Williams & Humbert
131884,Spain,"No complaints—just praise for this clean, easy red from a great vintage. The nose is crisp and fruity, with welcome citrus and wood notes. Blackberry mixed with vanilla and chocolate create a pleasant palate, while the finish is round and tinged by mocha.",Glorioso Reserva,90,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Palacio
131906,Spain,"One of the best red wines we've tried from Alicante. It's based on Monastrell, with other grapes thrown in. The result is a complex winner that smells like dark cherries and tastes like a swirl of raspberry, plum and chocolate. Very well balanced considering how warm 2003 was.",Beryna,90,17,Levante,Alicante,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Bernabe Navarro
131923,Spain,"The nose is all dense blackberries, while the palate is deep, flashy and ripe, with flavors of black cherry and blackberry. If you like big, bold wines, then this one should strike you in a good way; it's saturated and dark, with a touch of vanilla and mocha on the finish. Great balance for such a big wine. Drink now through 2012.",Élite,91,36,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Muruve
131974,Spain,"Méntrida is an island wine region in the middle of central Spain, and this blend of Garnacha and Syrah is lively, juicy and delicious. The nose is deep and luscious, with mounds of cassis and blackberry. The spunky palate shows big tannins but plenty of offsetting fruit and pulp. Finishing notes of chocolate and pepper leave a positive lasting impression. Should age for several more years; 400 cases produced.",NA,91,24,Central Spain,Mentrida,NA,Grenache-Syrah,Tres Patas
131978,Spain,"So thick and rich that it seems to fall apart in the mouth in pieces. There's rum raisin on the bouquet and then backing aromas and flavors of prune, orange rind, toffee, peanut and chocolate. It's rich, sweet and unctuous from start to finish, but with just enough balance and acidity to keep it upright. Sincere and delicious.",Premium Sweet Sherry 1827,91,20,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Pedro Ximénez,Osborne
131979,Spain,"A clear step up from the overdone 2003 Propiedad, this vintage is sweet and easy to like. There's a blast of hickory smoke on the new-oak nose, but also black fruit and molasses. The ripe palate deals chewy fruit, medium tannins and moderate length. It's a charming but blunt wine, and all in all it's probably not one to hold for too long. Drink now through 2009.",Propiedad,91,40,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Palacios Remondo
131983,Spain,"Having never tried this producer's wines, we can only heap praise on this medium-bodied, more modern style of Rioja. Bacon, rubber and raspberry work the bouquet, while the palate is ripe and full as it pumps forth with pure red-fruit flavors. Firm and mildly tannic, with ample new oak leaving lasting flavors of vanilla, coffee and pepper. Hold for another year or so, if possible; 900 cases produced.",Deóbriga Selección Familiar,91,22,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,R. de Ayala Lete E Hijos
131991,Spain,"These are the kinds of Best Buys we love. In the case of Muruve's '04 crianza, the wine overdelivers by a sum and a half. The nose brims with cola, tar, menthol and other dark aromas, while the big but balanced palate delivers a belt of blackberry and plum flavors along with chewy, ripe tannins. Good now with grilled meat, but will age for another five years should you want to invest in more than one bottle.",Crianza,91,15,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Muruve
131999,Spain,"Fruit overload and gumball richness define the syrupy, super ripe nose on this Monastrell (Mourvèdre) Cabernet Franc blend from Valencia. This is big stuff, with blackberry, prune and chocolate cake qualities. It's thick, intense, tannic and will continue to be lively and drinkable for another six or seven years. A surprise wine; 100 cases produced.",Minimum,91,65,Levante,Valencia,NA,Monastrell,Bodegas Rafael Cambra
132041,Spain,"A Rueda white that gets it right. Pure peach and nectarine aromas lead to a smooth, pure palate of peach and apple flavors. Its purity and poise are obvious and it has that extra bit of feel and elevation to the flavors.",Enebral,88,18,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Liberalia
132059,Spain,"Tough, earthy berry aromas provide a fierce outlook. The palate answers the call, showing syrupy richness amid piercing tannins. Flavors of baked black fruits yield to molasses on the short, stout finish. Tannic and solid, but very sweet. Could it use a bit more balance perhaps?",Gago,88,34,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Red Blend,Telmo Rodríguez
132074,Spain,"Rich and pruney, with bold, reduced black fruit aromas along with chocolate and spice. Compact and delicious in the mouth, with caramel, black coffee and other yummy, unctuous flavors. So thick it pours like motor oil, thus feel free to drink it like a wine or pour it on vanilla ice cream as you might a syrup.",Don Guido Aged 20 Years Rare Old Sweet,92,50,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Pedro Ximénez,Williams & Humbert
132122,Spain,"This is the type of wine that's giving resurgent Jumilla a positive reputation. The nose is smoky but still loaded with solid fruit, while the palate bubbles over with pure blackberry and plum. It's a Monastrell-dominated blend, but it tastes a lot like Tempranillo, which is only 15% of the blend. Very nice overall.",Selección Roble,89,13,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Alceño
132143,Spain,"A classic cava from top to bottom. The nose offers familiar baked apple, mineral and saline aromas, while the palate is exceedingly fresh in its delivery of pineapple, apple and nectarine flavors. A fruity yet crisp number that foams up nicely on the palate but doesn't lose its focus or form.",Aria Estate Brut,89,12,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
132145,Spain,"Black fruit, licorice and earth are all aromas of classic Montsant, and together they are easy to enjoy and understand. Ripe black cherry, pepper and an undercurrent of licorice and coffee work the palate, while the finish sports tight acids and smooth tannins. Good now through 2009.",NA,89,35,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Red Blend,Mas Franch
132147,Spain,"A touch heavy, but not nearly as weighty and syrupy as this winery's '03 Excelencia. At 14%, it's a bit raisiny and blustery, but the dark plum and coffee flavors do manage to please. And the finish is full of chocolate and fudge-like residue. Big but fun; ready to be drunk now.",El Albar,88,20,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,J. & F. Lurton
132148,Spain,"Keeps the Cordon Negro reputation healthy by delivering easygoing lemon-lime aromas and round citrus and apple flavors. As correct as one can ask for, this large-production cava features pure-fruit character and a perfectly good mouthfeel. For the money, we give it the proverbial high-five.",Cordon Negro Brut,88,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
132161,Spain,"Starts with aromas of clove, Band-Aid and other spicy aromas. It has a minor herbal essence both on the nose and palate, which is typical of Spanish Cabernet. But the feel is good and chewy, while the oak is moderate as it supports raspberry and dry cherry flavors. Features 15% Tempranillo; drink now.",Gran Coronas Reserva,87,20,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon,Torres
132162,Spain,"Borderline exotic on the nose, with aromas of black cherry, violet and a touch of earthy leather. The palate has some prickle and snap to it, but it settles into lively black plum and boysenberry. Finishes smooth, ripe and big, with medium length. The coupage is 80% Syrah and 20% Monastrell.",Nerola,87,23,Catalonia,Catalunya,NA,Syrah,Torres
132184,Spain,"This winery's flagship red is Tempranillo-based and it delivers round, blackberry, herb, tobacco and earth-based aromas. It's fairly creamy in the mouth, with generous flavors that hit the berry and plum chords and the descent into a deep finish of vanilla, oak and herbs. Not a cookie-cutter red; doesn't taste run-of-the-mill. Good through 2011.",Gaudium Gran Vino,90,50,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Red Blend,Marqués de Cáceres
132190,Spain,"Big and charred, but under the veil of new oak there's violet, blackberry and savory spice notes. Full throttle on the palate, with quality plum and cherry flavors. Tight and tannic late, but not overly rough. Should be at its best in 2007–08.",Campo Góticos,90,55,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,7 Lunas
132221,Spain,"Over a year ago this wine rated only 86, but bottle age has improved it, and now its condensed nose of black fruit and chocolate mint chip is very pleasing. The palate is ripe and offers blackberry and cured meat, while the finish delivers licorice, pepper and a touch of salami. Proof that wines do change over time, and that sometimes we underrate the youngsters.",NA,91,57,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Red Blend,Pago de Larrainzar
132229,Spain,"A forward wine with earthy aromas, leather and a hint of Navarra's herbal essence. The palate is full-bodied and complete, with balanced weight and tannic structure. Flavors of dark berry and black plum are deep and mildly roasted, while the finish is meaty and chocolaty. Chivite Colección 125 is often Navarra's best red wine, and that appears to be the case in 2004.",Colección 125 Reserva,91,45,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Julián Chivite
132232,Spain,"The excellent 2005 Azul is stout and secure, with a ripe, clean and modern bouquet that's backed up by a chewy, toasty flavor profile that pours on the black fruit and character. With roundness, tannic grip and good acidity, this wine is in perfect balance and is delivering the most it can. Tempranillo, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon.",Azul,91,18,Northern Spain,Ribera del Queiles,NA,Red Blend,Guelbenzu
132270,Spain,"Aromatically this is evocative; there's spice, tobacco and dried fruit in addition to classy, balanced oak. The palate dances with cherry, dried plum and earthy spice notes, while the finish is elegant, smooth and features just the right amount of tannic grab. A very nice, true-to-the-terroir type of Tempranillo.",Reserva,91,33,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,12 Linajes
132292,Spain,"With a gold glint and put-together aromas of peach, candle wax, mineral and citrus, this is very nice Albariño that's now fully ripe, mature and drinking at its best. The palate pits juicy melon against dry papaya; it's big, ripe, full and the perfect foil for all sorts of white-friendly foods. Only 1,000 cases made of this reserve-style wine.",Erxebre,90,15,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Condes de Albarei
132303,Spain,"Much like the 2004, this wine straddles traditional and modern lines. The nose offers light raisin, spearmint, brick dust and leafy red fruit aromas, while the palate may seem acidic and sour to some but reflective of old Rioja to others. Strong American oak accents of dill, coconut and vanilla are present on the palate and finish. Drink now through 2012.",Coto de Imaz Reserva,88,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,El Coto
132308,Spain,"Ultraripe, almost to the point of being syrupy and soupy. The nose is all sweet licorice, baked fruit and raisin. In the mouth, there's some tannic bite but mostly it's a rich, bruising, unctuous wine with smoky, rich berry flavors and a sweet, toasty finish.",Selección Personal,88,80,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Red Blend,Cyan
132311,Spain,"Luzon's signature Best Buy red blends one-third Syrah with two-thirds Monastrell, and always with consistent results. Year after year, we like this wine's lusty, broad fruit, richness and overall balance. It's not sophisticated or complex, but it is deep, clean and very tasty.",NA,88,9,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Luzón
132317,Spain,"Dry, minty and saucy on the nose, with an old-school sheer palate full of acidity, citrus, cherry tomato, herbs and snap.

Drink now through 2012.",Reserva Privada,88,60,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Marqués de Vargas
132400,Spain,"Deep purple in color, with roasted, rubbery aromas of wild blackberry. Thick, lush and rich in the mouth, with mellow tannins (for a Priorat wine) and big, broad flavors of plum, blackberry and herbs. Smooth on the finish, with black tea notes and leftover oak. Has a lot going for it; drink now through 2012.",Cartoixa,91,52,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Scala Dei
132404,Spain,"A genuinely attractive, well-made old vines red with earthy, minerally aromas along with violet petal and blackberry.

132421,Spain,"Slightly sweet on the nose, the aromas of baked fruit, cream soda and vanilla are welcoming. Interestingly, the wine is a bit more tart and refined on the palate, where zesty but full apple and pear flavors run the show. Not lean but definitely streamlined and acidic. More of a food wine than a stand-alone sipper.",Brut Reserva,88,14,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
132438,Spain,"Fairly agile, floral and friendly, with precise peach, nectarine and citrus flavors. With its easy personality and good mouthfeel, this is what you're looking for in a solid, everyday white wine.",NA,88,16,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Essencia Vendima
132443,Spain,"Shows good fruit aromas, moderate depth and a touch of sandalwood on the nose. The palate features ripe blackberry and chocolate, while the feel is cushioned and chewy. Modern in style; just a cut below the 2001.",Reserve,88,44,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Callejo
132448,Spain,"This rendition of Segura Viudas's off-dry bubbly is nice and yeasty, with plenty of baked apple pie and buttered toast on the nose. The palate is spunky but round, with semi-sweet flavors of apples and ripe nectarines. Shows some complexity and depth on the finish as well as a richness that makes it to all corners of your mouth.",Aria Extra Dry,88,12,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
132466,Spain,"Consistent with past vintages, this crianza gets it right without setting off any balloons. It starts with raspberry and cassis aromas and backs that up with slightly citrusy red-fruit flavors. Any rawness or heat on the palate will be tamed by matching it with meat, chorizo, ham, cheese, etc.",Crianza,86,25,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Alidis
132470,Spain,"An oily, earthy wine with plenty of belt strap and dark fruit on the nose. The palate is a bit scattered, but there's ample mineral and blackberry to move it forward. The feel is choppy due to pronounced acidity, yet the finish is generally clean and fluid.",Clos les Fites Criança,86,29,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,La Perla del Priorat
132473,Spain,"Stocky and warm, with mild baked-fruit aromas and a hint of bramble. This venerable table wine is made from 65% Garnacha and 35 Cariñena, and from 2005 it's pretty much on the money. Expect earthy, mildly brambly flavors, lively acidity and soft tannins. Good for a wide range of simple foods and appetizers.",Sangre de Toro,86,10,Catalonia,Catalunya,NA,Red Blend,Torres
132475,Spain,"A holdover from 1999, this varietal single-vineyard Cabernet offers tree bark, molasses and prune on the nose, while the palate has raspberry flavors sitting front and center, with drying tannins in support. It's a woody and grabby wine, with vanilla notes toward the end. And at eight years old, it doesn't appear as though it will improve beyond where it's at now. So drink soon.",Vinya La Scala Gran Reserva,86,55,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pago Jean Leon
132478,Spain,"Slightly warmer in style, with caramel and vanilla aromas, yet the palate runs more toward freshness, with orange and pineapple standing out. With its good acidity and zest, this wine won't ever be called flabby. Drink now for solid results.",Montesol,86,15,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Vinos Sanz
132487,Spain,"The bouquet delivers touches of graphite and rubber in front of traditional dried cherry and raspberry.

Drink now through 2010.",Gran Reserva,89,26,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Montecillo
132491,Spain,"Dark and attractive in terms of color, with barrique-driven aromas of bacon, toast and roasted plum and berry.

Shows some licorice and burnt toast on the fairly long finish.",Flor de Grealo,89,33,Catalonia,Costers del Segre,NA,Red Blend,Vinya L'Hereu
132492,Spain,"There's no shortage of barrel-driven hickory, coffee and chocolate on this modern-style Rioja, but there's also a spike of green on the nose and at the core of the flavor profile. Surrounding that is bright blackberry, amplified tannins and bursting acidity. Needs air upon opening—that, or more time in the cellar.",Coto Real Reserva,89,48,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,El Coto
132498,Spain,"Open-cut oak, blackberry and chocolate are the opening shots in this plump, ripe, full-bodied red that is slightly tannic and chewy but impressive due to solid plum, cherry and vanilla flavors. Delivers commendable RdD quality, but $300 is shockingly expensive.",Prestigio Pago de las Solanas,89,300,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,Matarromera
132499,Spain,"Leans toward the modern style, with plenty of oak, bacon and plum on the bouquet. Quite upright and balanced throughout, with cherry, raspberry, cola and brown sugar for flavors. A thorough, heartily oaked Tempranillo with purity and style. Almost at the top echelon.",Reserva,89,35,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Valenciso
132534,Spain,"Full and boisterous red wine, with a ton of natural ripeness and a high pleasure quotient. We have always liked the Abadal wines, and this Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend gets both sides of the Old World/New World argument right. It's loaded with dark berry and earth aromas, which are followed by cola, blackberry and chocolate flavors. An alert, acid-driven wine with enough depth to impress.",Abadal Crianza,90,17,Catalonia,Pla de Bages,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Masies d'Avinyo
132573,Spain,"Dark and spicy, with rubber and baked-fruit aromas giving way to herbs, clove and other alluring spice scents. As might be expected from a wine bearing Alvaro Palacios' signature and approval, the final product is smart and snappy, with blackberry, herbs and barrel char all making themselves noticed. Good now and for the next several years.",La Montesa,90,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Red Blend,Palacios Remondo
132581,Spain,"A firm wine with fine structure and balance. The nose is fiery and rustic early on, then seductive as it opens up. The palate exhibits currents of raspberry, cherry and plum, and below the surface there's vanilla and brown sugar. A smooth operator that shows the Campo Viejo brand in its best light.",Gran Reserva,90,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Campo Viejo
132618,Spain,"Inky and condensed, with tough early aromas that settle on rich, sweet berry fruit. The palate has good liveliness and bullish tannins, while the flavor profile of blackberry and cassis is par for the course. Chewy on the finish.",Vendimia Seleccionada,87,24,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Viña Mayor
132692,Spain,"Rich, dense and syrupy, but also showing touches of mint and leather on the nose. Quite sticky in the mouth, but with lovely toffee and mocha flavors that set up a finish that runs on and on. Impressive depth of flavor, nice overall balance and a mix of complexity and flat-out richness make this PX a winner.",Nectar Dulce,91,18,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Pedro Ximénez,González Byass
132701,Spain,"Round, stylish and wholesome on the nose, with wild berry, smoke, spice and not too much obvious oak. The palate is racy and forward, but also offers subtleties including dry fruit, spice, fresh tomato and wild herbs such as thyme and sage. Long and warm on the finish, with vanilla. Drink now through 2015.",Fincas de Ganuza Reserva,91,48,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Remírez de Ganuza
132708,Spain,"Dense and heavy, and maybe a touch dull on the nose in terms of fruit aromas. But once it hits the palate the wine shines with intense black fruit, sugar beet and chocolate flavors. The finish is toasty and warm, with saturation and texture. Almost over the edge as far as ripeness, but not quite. Drink now through 2012.",Vendimia Seleccionada,91,59,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,García Figuero
132709,Spain,"Another impressive Oloroso from Gonzalez Byass. This is a sweet, dark, brooding Sherry with prune and other sweet fruit aromas. The palate is rich but has good flow, while dark flavors of dulce de leche and burnt brown sugar are wonderful.

132716,Spain,"Serious, stately Rioja with key aromas of prune, blackberry and leather. Snappy enough on the palate, with plenty of pop as well as pure berry flavors, smooth tannins, zest and dry vanilla. Some might call it a bit acidic and traditional, but with food it'll do great. Drink now through 2016. Only 250 cases made.",El Belisario,91,80,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Agrícola Labastida
132721,Spain,"Patience is a must to make it through this burly, earthy, almost murky blend of Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon. Early aromas of mulch and coffee morph into black fruit and leather, while initially reduced black cherry and currant flavors take on more character and depth with time. Never does it really shine, but it is a serious wine that has its merits.",Cuvée Palomar,88,48,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Abadia Retuerta
132723,Spain,"One of my personal favorites among the giant collection of Freixenet cavas is the extra dry, which isn't dry in the least. Just the opposite, it's loaded with sweet apple and apricot aromas along with peach, melon and candied citrus flavors. Best of all, it maintains its poise while never falling toward cloying or sappy.",Cordon Negro Extra Dry,88,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
132727,Spain,"Robust and dark, with plum and berry aromas that also carry hints of citrus and mineral. Overall this is a balanced specimen; the palate is round and full of bright plum and berry while the feel is moderately deep, somewhat tannic, and medium in acidity. Drink now.",Crianza,88,17,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,Valdrinal
132732,Spain,"A bit lighter on the nose than many, with notes of raspberry and strawberry. That same character works its way onto the palate, where raspberry and plum flavors are front and center. Fruity and balanced, with a ripe, easy-to-like personality.",NA,88,17,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Mas Dels Frares
132733,Spain,"Hard spices, smoke and tar darken up the berry nose, while the palate is round and solid, with nice berry and plum fruit.

132738,Spain,"Dark in color, with brawny aromas of oak, clove and leather. In the mouth, there's a mix of black plum and cherry but also a streak of bell pepper. Finishes round, spicy, properly tannic and dark, with coffee and a light hint of green.",Viña Lanciano Reserva,87,25,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas LAN
132740,Spain,"Bulky and a bit stewy, but still balanced enough to earn its positive points. The palate is ripe and sweet, as it oozes with black fruit. Some might call it a touch chunky, but for the most part this blend of Monastrell, Tempranillo and Syrah registers as a highly pleasurable red.",Tinto,87,10,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Alceño
132743,Spain,"Sweet and spicy stuff, with plenty of oak-based coconut and butter on the nose. In the mouth, it's quite saturated and flush, with overt plum, blackberry and wood resin notes. A big, modern wine that's a bit oafish but also rather easy to drink.",Agnus Crianza,87,25,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Valdelana
132760,Spain,"Lots of oak gives the nose a strong coconut essence, while the flavors of baked red plum and berries bring along notes of pepper and spice. This is a meaty, hot wine with maple and resin on the finish. It shows flashes of brilliance but also ruggedness and a few clumsy characteristics.",NA,86,82,Spanish Islands,Vi de la Terra Illes Balears,NA,Red Blend,Ribas de Cabrera
132763,Spain,"In accordance to what 2003 dealt out, this wine is a bit stewy and broad. It shows cola, tree bark and baked fruit on the nose, and then sweet plum and chocolate on the finish. It's not a wine for deep contemplation; drink now to enjoy its robust plumpness.",Crianza,86,25,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Campos Góticos
132769,Spain,A better effort than in previous years. This vintage has a tangy personality and no tricks up its sleeve. The pineapple and citrus flavors are solid and the finish holds onto the Verdejo's citrusy profile. Steady and clean all the way through.,NA,86,8,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Solar de la Vega
132771,Spain,"Early on the wine is dominated by buttery oak, and it's all over the nose, palate and finish. Airing settles it down, and up from the creamy underworld comes raspberry, stewed plums and chocolate. Not the thinking man's Ribera del Duero, but it gets the job done. Imported by Freixenet, USA.",Crianza,86,18,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Valdubón
132779,Spain,"This Garnacha- and Carignan-based wine offers a brilliant color and a true bouquet of graphite, mineral, char and black fruit. Thus expectations are high as you head to the palate, which turns out to be sheer, acidic and hard. Amid the scour you'll pull out plum and blackberry flavors. It gets it two-thirds right; the nose and color are there but the mouthfeel is lacking.",Finca El Puig,86,33,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Fuentes
132788,Spain,"A slight step up from the Crianza, mostly because it's a level or two more intense. The nose is powerful, albeit full of earthy funk and leather. The palate is snappy and full, with black cherry dominant. Finishes warm and spicy, with cola and chocolate.",Selección Especial,89,40,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Red Blend,Montebaco
132789,Spain,"Wines like this are good indicators that 2004 is indeed an exceptional vintage in RdD. For a Tempranillo that spent only five months in oak it's fairly settled. The nose is a touch syrupy but you can only love the concentrated berry aromas. The mouth is bulky but satisfying, with huge dark-fruit flavors and balancing tannins and acidity. Jumpy but very likable.",Oak Aged,89,17,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Rubiejo
132798,Spain,"Ripe and round, with blackberry and bacon aromas. Quite modern and full for a 2002, one of Rioja's most challenging vintages in a while. Shows full berry flavors with ample oak and a touch of tannin. Finishes with mocha and spice.",Selección,89,40,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Alabanza
132807,Spain,"LAN's modern interpretation of Rioja is ripe, fragrant and beefy, with mineral, charcoal, pine and black cherry coating the unctuous nose. Runs a touch soft and plump on the palate, probably a reflection of the hot '03 vintage. But along the way there's black plum, licorice, molasses and maple flavors. A big, new-wave wine that has a lot going for it.",Edición Limitada,89,45,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas LAN
132817,Spain,"Ripe, dark, a little oily and totally compelling from an aromatic standpoint. The palate is right where it should be, as neither the tannins nor the acidity are out of whack. Boysenberry, blackberry and plum flavors carry an herbal touch, and the finish is layered, with a lasting impression of coffee.",Reserva,90,32,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Conde de Siruela
132837,Spain,"Purple in color and meaty on the nose, with a hint of raisin and reduction but not too much. Due to the heat of 2003, this is a ripe, rich wine with big plum and berry flavors but also good balance and feel. It covers all the bases and finishes in a smooth, solid, stylish way. Just reaches the cut of excellence.",Fincas de Ganuza Reserva,90,51,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Remírez de Ganuza
132905,Spain,"Robust aromas of ripe berry fruit and bacon give this a full and lusty starting point, while the textured body is rich, with sturdy tannins. Flavors of blackberry and black cherry are sweet, and the wine has good character and bounce. A wine you want to drink on a regular basis.",Roble,87,10,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,La Mano
132918,Spain,"Attractive, full-force plum and berry aromas with a fruity, rich, concentrated palate of black fruit and plum. Smooth, nothing fancy, and always solid for those looking for a big, full-bodied wine at an affordable price. Luzon is the definition of a go-to producer.",Luzon Verde,87,9,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Bodegas Luzón
132961,Spain,"A smooth and coaxing Sherry with almond and dried fruit aromas that lead perfectly to toffee and almond flavors. There's more dryness than fruit here, with peanut brittle accents and then a long, smoky finish that doesn't lose focus. Graceful Oloroso, with a nice individual character.",Cristina Oloroso Abacado,91,18,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,González Byass
132977,Spain,"This is nothing more than a few barrels of wine bottled by Hughes, a so-called “global vintner.” And like its Lot 128 brother, it is really good juice. Inky and floral, with blueberry and wild raspberry flavors. It's smooth, fresh, bold and finishes with mint and chocolate. Shows the positives of Campo de Borja's Garnacha.",Lot 129,90,15,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Cameron Hughes
132986,Spain,"Dry and smooth, with balsam and cedar aromas wrapped around controlled fruit scents and toast. The wine is ripe and balanced, with hickory flavors adding a barbecued angle to the steady palate. Firm, structured and tasting of clove and woodspice on the finish. Drink now through 2011.",Crianza,90,19,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Solabal
133022,Spain,"Pinot Noir-based cavas are touchy; sometimes they take on a rough, peppery personality that some might find offputting. This wine does that, but only to an extent. The nose pushes peach pit and campfire aromas, while the palate features dry fruits like papaya and melon, but with cinnamon and pepper shadings. Good mouthfeel and well made, but the flavors and aromas require some getting used to.",Brut,87,14,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Pinot Noir,Codorníu
133023,Spain,"Brick colored, with a baked, spicy nose that is true Rioja in that it also pushes Sherry, raisin and cinnamon notes. Fairly dry, acidic and zesty in the mouth, with cherry and cola flavors. Forceful acidity keeps it moving along. Needs food to absorb that acid.",Reserva,87,18,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Castillo Labastida
133032,Spain,"Generally speaking, this wine is nicely balanced and a bit less over the top than most 2003s. The nose shows mint, fresh herbs, graphite and berry aromas. The palate is juicy, not dull or heavy, with black cherry and dark plum flavors. Finishes almost crisp, with a shot of balancing acidity.",NA,87,17,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tempranillo,Tres Lunas
133036,Spain,"Deep in color, falling somewhere between copper and red. The nose is forward as could be, with raspberry and a strong hint of orange blossom. Solid across the palate, with dry berry flavors and a powerful edge of pepper. Based on Pinot Noir; you can taste the essence of that variety at its core.",Aria Brut Rosé,87,12,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Pinot Noir,Segura Viudas
133037,Spain,"With its citrusy nose and well-balanced palate, this is what Best Buy sparklers are all about. Tangerine and orange peel grace the bouquet, while crisp flavors of berries and stone fruits win you over. A bit of strawberry and snap close the deal. Nice stuff.",Brut Rosé,87,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
133059,Spain,"Mineral, citrus, natural vanilla and grass aromas send this still-kicking Verdejo on its way. The palate is all about apple and citrus, and the feel is more polished than edgy. Seems as if it's flattening and losing some steam, so drink now.",NA,86,14,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Cuatro Rayas
133060,Spain,"Peach, nectarine and green pear aromas and flavors dominate this ripe-styled Verdejo-Viura blend. Typical of Rueda, it's citrusy and a zesty, but there's enough warmth and heft so that you wouldn't call it steely or stark. Drink now.",Señorio de Garci Grande Verdejo-Viura,86,10,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,White Blend,Bodegas Garci Grande
133065,Spain,"A little warmer and rounder than most. This waxy wine offers banana and melon on the nose, while the palate is just juicy and racy enough, with apple and citrus anchoring things. Finishes easy and will go well with salads and seafood.",Montesol Clásico,86,12,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,White Blend,Vinos Sanz
133072,Spain,"Sulfurous early on, and then citrus and apple blossom aromas get into the game. The palate is ripe and tropical, with melon, mango and banana flavors. With no angularity or sharpness, this is an easy wine with soft edges. Drink now before it gets even softer.",Señorio de Garci Grande,85,14,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Bodegas Garci Grande
133075,Spain,"Berry fruit, vanilla and violet aromas are friendlier than the rugged, ultrafirm palate on this Syrah-Graciano blend. With food, the wine will be a strong counterpoint and will hold its own. By itself it may slip in pleasure points; the Graciano is tight as nails and adds astringency. Imported by Möet Hennessy USA, Inc.",Caliza,85,22,Central Spain,Dominio de Valdepusa,NA,Red Blend,Marques de Griñon
133078,Spain,"Open, round and a bit rubbery, this bright-styled wine is jammy and easy to drink. It has black cherry and blueberry flavors riding on grabby tannins, and the finish is where you get some of the “roble,” meaning oak-based chocolate and vanilla notes.",Roble,85,16,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,12 Linajes
133083,Spain,"Brick colored, with an earthy, gritty nose that deals leather, rhubarb and burnt fruit. The flavor package is reserved and citrusy, what some might call dilute. But it's classic old-school Rioja. Finishes light, with tea and toast.",Coto de Imaz Reserva,88,21,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,El Coto
133100,Spain,"Gets off the mark with savory aromas akin to bean and bacon soup, wood smoke and dried herbs. Next comes raspberry and plum fruit supported by ample oak-based vanilla. Finishes creamy, round and solid. Just a sip or two and you know you're drinking true Rioja.",Reserva,88,22,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Red Blend,Marqués de Cáceres
133106,Spain,"Typically brick-colored and oxidized, which leads to the idea that it's 25 years old already. Unique in every way: The nose is like deconstructed citrus, sherry and leather, while the palate will seem sour if compared to most other reds and zesty if you're coming off a white wine. Hard to describe; a wine for some to admire and others to say, “What the hell?”",Viña Cubillo Crianza,88,25,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,R. Lopez de Heredia
133108,Spain,"Makes a great early impression via ripe blackberry and toast aromas. Overall there's not much negative to say about this meaty, fruity youngster; it has a lovely color, dark cherry and blackberry flavors, and warm vanilla and chocolate notes on the finish. Becomes more tannic and chunky as it opens; but as an easy drinker it's very good.",Roble,88,19,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,Balbas
133170,Spain,"The wines of Abelis Carthago are enigmatic. The lowest-priced Lui is the most balanced and complete. This wine, William, is dark and dense, with shoe polish and raw crude oil on the nose. It's super strapping and tannic, with bitter chocolate and coffee notes carrying the racy palate to a fiery finish. It lacks nuance and subtlety but will augment a good steak with nary a problem.",William Selection,90,34,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Abelis Carthago
133194,Spain,"Caramel, molasses and spice aromas make this a totally approachable and familiar type of Sherry. The palate offers a round but zesty attack, with flavors of caramel, coffee, toffee, baked apple and orange peel. For the most part it's racy and fresh, but finishing mushroom and pepper notes give it added character.",Premium Oloroso Medium 10RF,90,16,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Osborne
133198,Spain,"There's no denying the wine's core strengths, which start with the bouquet's campfire and prune qualities and extend onto the palate, where peppy raspberry and plum flavors take over. This is a complete, stylish Rioja that's about halfway through the aging process. It's still juicy and agile, with licorice and raisin notes adding some sweetness. Drink now–2016.",Gran Reserva,90,38,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Ramón Bilbao
133199,Spain,"Ripe, jammy and forward, Prima could become the blueprint for affordable but well-made Toro wines. It's a modern bruiser from a modern, spotless facility, and it offers a clash of wild berry flavors, big-time tannins and powerful acidity. Like most Toro wines, it'll take your cheeks to the cleaners if you don't have meaty foods, cheese or lots of water to go with it. Drink now through 2012.",Prima,90,18,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Maurodos
133210,Spain,"Baked berry, earth and black tea aromas give this wine a solid opening, while the mouthfeel is gritty but honest. Flavors of brown sugar and lightly baked berry fruit indicate the warmth and stony soils of Cigales, while the finish hints at cassis liqueur. Drink now before it fades.",Crianza,87,21,Northern Spain,Cigales,NA,Tinto del Pais,Museum
133223,Spain,"Purple in color, with extracted, rubbery, gaseous aromas that settle with time. More power than finesse here, with cheek-smacking, saturated fruit and a bit of spice. A bull of a wine with briary flavors that fade quickly on the finish. Only 300 cases made.",El Puño Unfiltered Red Wine,87,50,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Red Blend,El Escocés Volante
133224,Spain,"Best on the nose, where there's a mix of caramel, roasted fruit and lemon peel. The palate is big, sticky and tannic, with salty, semi herbal flavors of raspberry and leather. Spicy and basic on the finish. A plump, simple wine. Drink now.",Atio,87,55,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Emina
133266,Spain,"With some toast and popcorn to fatten up the standard apple aromas, this is a fairly rich cava, especially given the price. Apple, pear and cinnamon flavors grace the palate, while the finish is persistent beyond expectations. Not overly bubbly but still lively. Strides better than your average quaffer.",Original Brut,87,9,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Codorníu
133267,Spain,"As under-$10 sparklers go, you'd be hard-pressed to find better than this medium-bodied and toasty version from Catalonia's White Castle. The nose is mildly yeasty but basic, while the palate deals juicy apple and white-grape flavors propelled by fresh acidity. Virtuous yet basic. But who's complaining?",Extra Brut,87,8,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Castellblanch
133280,Spain,"A little bit sweet and doughy, but hardly offputting. Deep flavors of cherry, raspberry and strawberry control the palate, while the finish is chocolaty and long. This is one easy-to-like red; it's not complex but it scores plenty of simple pleasure points.",NA,87,9,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Santonegro
133286,Spain,"Sweet and fresh smelling, with aromas of lime, pear and peach. The palate is all about citrus, with some spice and mineral thrown in for good measure. Balanced and zesty, like Albariño should be.",NA,87,15,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Mar de Frades
133289,Spain,"Consistency at a good price is what this textbook cava is all about. The bouquet offers your basic fruit-cocktail aromas, while the palate is sort of plump as it pours on the nectarine and ripe peach flavors. Easygoing, with some weight and roundness.",Carta Nevada Brut,87,9,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
133293,Spain,"A fuller, more minty and deep Garnacha than Hughes' Lot 129. This has standup, standout aromas followed by deep berry fruit flavors. It has plenty of body but keeps its balance, and the finish is thick and strong. A little rugged but really good by regional standards.",Lot 128,90,15,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Cameron Hughes
133295,Spain,"A touch horsey at first, but with time it settles on saddle leather and earthy fruit. The palate is chunky and beefy, with some funk, chocolate and herbal black fruit. Not super spunky and lively, but dense as a brick and interesting. Drink now through 2014.",Torre Albéniz Reserva,90,50,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Finca Torremilanos
133304,Spain,"Ripe and attractive, with deep red fruit aromas. The palate is intense and thorough, with solid tannins supporting ripe, natural flavors of baked berries, particularly blackberry and dark plum. Subtle and smooth on the finish, with length. The blend is 50% Garnacha and 25% each Carignan and Cabernet Sauvignon. Drink now through 2013.",Castell de Falset,90,40,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Red Blend,Agricola Falset-Marca
133305,Spain,"A potent, concentrated sort of wine with minerally, crusty aromas, smoked meat and black fruit. The palate is deep and ripe, with pure, tasty, sweet flavors of mildly baked blackberry. Generous late, with mocha and toast on the finish. Best now through 2012.",Reserva,90,36,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Alidis
133310,Spain,"Bold, dark and handsome, albeit a touch herbal and earthy on the nose. The palate is thick and statuesque, with herbal, rooty berry fruit, a spot of raisin, and cracked black pepper. Chewy, deep and ultimately dry on the finish. Drinkable now; best in another couple of years.",Gran Reserva,90,53,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Prado Rey
133358,Spain,"Not a bad value in the Albariño category. Alba Rosa is the second wine from Martinez Serantes, and it's yellowish in color, with a pineapple and pear nose. Solid in the mouth, with touches of apple, white peach and lime. Proper acidity keeps it fresh.",Alba Rosa,85,15,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Adega Martínez Serantes
133359,Spain,"The nose has the vintage's heavy quality, yet the palate runs toward acidic, with an emphasis on red cherry and raspberry. The more it opens, and the more the wine's tannins and acids do their thing, the tougher it gets. Food seems like a must.",Crianza,85,25,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,12 Linajes
133360,Spain,"Cantaloupe, almond candy and orange blossom make for a sweet nose. The palate seems too close to orange juice and tangerine than the apple and peach that best defines Rías Baixas. But for anyone who likes fresh, pulpy juice, it tastes perfectly good.",Granbazán Ambar,85,19,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Agro de Bazán
133369,Spain,"There's some stewed fruit weighing down this Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon blend, but for the most part it has it going on. Coffee, oak and leather aromas set up a palate of raspberry, plum and chocolate. There's a fair amount of acid for an ‘03, and that lends legs to a wine that might otherwise seem tired.",NA,85,29,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Vitis Terrarum
133379,Spain,"Smooth on the nose, with vanilla and peach aromas. It's starting to fade but if you catch it soon you'll get apple, pineapple and some pithy character on both the palate and finish. Tastes wet and easy, and not at all complicated.",NA,85,10,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,White Blend,Inspiración Pampano
133381,Spain,"Fairly stylish and true to the region; the nose is both meaty and leathery, with rustic but composed notes of roast plum, earth and oak. Blackberry and plum flavors are convincing, while the finish offers the right amount of spice and vanilla.",Crianza,88,20,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Red Blend,Montebaco
133389,Spain,"Plum, berry and other ripe fruits make for a solid, pure, attractive bouquet. The wine is fairly deep and plummy, with red raspberry raising the red-fruit quotient. Full and balanced, with modest complexity. Seems solid for a front-line '03.",Prestigio,88,26,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,Emina
133474,Spain,"Montsant's inherent character is nicely captured in this blend of Carignan, Syrah and Grenache. The bouquet is entirely smooth and inviting, if a bit generic. And the palate delivers ripe berry flavors that don't vary much from the fruity and basic. Call it simple or call it just right for the price; this is a fine red wine with character, balance and ease.",NA,89,16,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Red Blend,Can Blau
133484,Spain,"Tropical aromas mixed with pear are just right, and overall this Treixadura-Godello-Torrontes blend is ripe and delicious. It's round but zesty, with pear, kiwi and honeydew flavors. It stays on message from front to back, and despite its size and ripeness it keeps everything in balance. Drink now.",NA,89,19,Galicia,Ribeiro,NA,White Blend,Finca Teira
133492,Spain,"Protos is a venerable RDD label that doesn't try to do too much with its wines. This youngster is tight, polished and deep, with rich, oily aromas and creamy, saturated blackberry, plum and chocolate flavors. With spice and depth, it shows how good the 2005 vintage is, even for a big-production joven like this.",Roble,89,13,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Protos
133501,Spain,"Rather hard and lightly grassy on the nose, with a green streak running through blueberry aromas. The palate is narrow and strained for a wine of this price, with rhubarb, red plum and grass-influenced flavors. Has qualities but doesn't fully click. 5,000 cases made.",Erial Tradicion Familia,87,45,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Epifanio Rivera
133518,Spain,"Deep black fruit aromas make it inviting, while the palate is hefty and soft-edged, with creamy vanilla-infused plum and berry flavors. Finishes with mild berry fruit but more butter and cream. Grows softer and more pedestrian the longer it airs out.",Carivin Reserve,87,19,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Tempranillo,Grandes Vinos y Viñedos
133565,Spain,"Red fruit is the focus of this zesty, rugged Tempranillo-based wine. The palate is lively and acidic, as plum and berry flavors get lots of boost. The finish is firm and medium in depth, with a stout amount of tannin. Drink now, preferably with food.",Gran Feudo Reserva,87,15,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Julián Chivite
133566,Spain,"Hay, corn and buttered toast are the initial aromas, and soon after the wine settles into a pretty good groove. The palate is pure and sweet, with sticky, ripe fruit flavors that veer toward fruit cocktail and mango but never turn cloying. This wine handles its sugar like a pro.",Semi-Seco,87,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Castellblanch
133570,Spain,"A wave of pleasant but light cherry, blackberry and sage offers a powerful but not overpowering opening. The palate is juicy and fresh, with controlled cherry and a touch of buttered toast. Round and medium in size on the finish, with solid but correct tannins.",Crianza,87,16,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Viña Salceda
133573,Spain,"Warm and the slightest bit raisiny, but overall it's a bright, fruity blend of Monastrell and Tempranillo that's tasty and worth every dollar. Flavors of black cherry and vanilla are cuddly, while the finish is long and of medium potency. A treat for those who enjoy fruity, somewhat softer reds.",Crianza,87,12,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Santonegro
133603,Spain,"An easygoing but nicely made Rioja that delivers purity, good fruit, body and feel. The nose is all cherry and berry, and it's a clear step up from your everyday red wine. The palate is medium bodied, with tasty, spicy flavors of cherry and raspberry. Lasting on the finish, with proper texture throughout.",Finca Vallobera,90,32,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Vallobera
133660,Spain,"With its creamy oak and baked, stretched-out flavors, is it worth $110? You can decide, but the nose has that mildly cooked, heavy character that is reflective of 2003, and the palate is bland and drying as it mixes in oaky coconut and vanilla flavors. At one moment it's sharp and tangy; then it seems better. A confounding Tempranillo that doesn't excite.",Pago Negralada,84,110,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo,Abadia Retuerta
133664,Spain,"Leathery and peanutty on the nose; soon the aromas expand to baked plum and stewy berries. The palate is sturdy and tannic, but there's enough flesh and weight to the fruit that it's mostly balanced. Finishes with bacon and leather accents.",Pecunia,84,25,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Campos Góticos
133666,Spain,"Osborne can usually be counted on for consistency and traditional flavors. But this Amontillado is all over the map. The nose has some harsh chemical compounds, while the palate is salty like a handfull of peanuts. Shows flashes but tends to fall back into a realm best left alone. Imported by W. J. Deutsch & Sons.",Premium Fino Amontillado Coquinero Fino,84,16,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Osborne
133667,Spain,"Not every swing for the fences is rewarded with a home run. This wine, from a hot year, spent 22 months in oak. Thus it's a firebomb of dark, medicinal fruit mixed with root beer, lemon peel and creamy chocolate. Never does it really unfold or find a groove, and at times it's aggressive.",Parcela El Nogal,84,75,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Pago de los Capellanes
133675,Spain,"At 70% Tempranillo and only 25% Cabernet and Merlot, there's a detectable green core running through the nose and palate. Surrounding that is sizable fruit and oak, the latter of which adds dill to the fray. All in all there's enough body and soul to save the wine, but along the way it's got some issues.",Selección Especial,84,23,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Abadia Retuerta
133682,Spain,"Dark fruit, tobacco and leathery spice make for a nice bouquet. Tight and forceful in the mouth, with ripe black fruit and firm tannins. Chocolate and espresso come on toward the finish of this thorough, flavorful wine. Satisfying but not a spectacle.",Pago de las Costanas,87,35,Northern Spain,Cigales,NA,Tempranillo,Val de Los Frailes
133705,Spain,"Full and raring to go. This is one lively, big-boned red. It spreads out on the bouquet in peppery, boisterous fashion before unveiling lively raspberry and other red fruits on a bulky, tannic palate. Fairly big and untamed; a year or two more time might soften it up.",Atio,87,44,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,Emina
133706,Spain,"Full and toasty, with roasted fruit, meat and leather on the ripe, robust bouquet. Blackberry and plum flavors are good, and the mouthfeel is manly if a bit tannic. Undoubtedly a warm-vintage wine with size but not a ton of depth. Drink now.",NA,87,25,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Condado de Haza
133707,Spain,"Medium-strength plum and cherry aromas mix with earth and leather on a bouquet that's not all that fruity but still shows fruit. In the mouth, there's raspberry and red plum flavors floating on juicy, snappy acidity. Mouthfilling but hardly ponderous. Stylish in a somewhat classic mode.",Gran Reserva,87,44,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Lealtanza
133739,Spain,"With pretty flower blossom aromas mixed with lemon verbena, the nose on this Albariño is very nice. There's body and weight, but balance, too. Melon, citrus and mineral flavors are clean and satisfying, and the acidity is bright and entirely food-ready.",NA,89,15,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Condes de Albarei
133740,Spain,"Browning and maturing, but still showing a ton of life and kick. This traditional-style wine is mildly roasted on the nose, with touches of leather, latex and other firm aromas. The palate is nice, with dry raspberry and cherry flavors finishing with power and length. Solid and respectable, but not something you'd label as special. Drink now–2014.",Faustino de Autor Reserva Especial,89,59,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Faustino
133741,Spain,"You wouldn't call this wine “clean and polished.” It has some old country brett along with fig, earth, mushroom and liqueur on the nose. That said, it's dishing up heavy servings of chocolate and baked berry pie flavors. A big, bulky wine that's already losing clarity. This won't be for everyone.",Monte Toro Roble,89,17,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Bodegas Ramon Ramos
133750,Spain,"Rustic, smoky and deep on the nose, with a creamy body holding up commendable raspberry and plum flavors. Valenciso deals medium-level acids and tannins, with oak-based mocha and chocolate carrying the finish. This wine is so close to reaching the next level, but it doesn't quite get there.",Reserva,89,39,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Valenciso
133752,Spain,"Slightly rooty and warm, with a nose that's one part stewy and malty and another part complex and fruity. In the mouth, vanilla and spice add character to common berry fruit flavors, while the finish is silky and fairly long. Overall this is a nice, handsome wine with balance and character. Expect to be pleased but not blown away.",Reserva,89,30,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Marqués de Arviza
133753,Spain,"Very nice for a 2002. The wine is elegant and delivers aromas of violets, minerals and dried fruits. The palate folds in chocolate and spice along with a layer of blackberry flavor. We wouldn't call it superconcentrated or complex, but it's driven, pure and pleasurable. Smells, weighs and tastes a lot like Bordeaux.",Gaudium Gran Vino,89,64,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Marqués de Cáceres
133761,Spain,"Ysios is a ripe, smooth wine with polished aromas of black fruit, charred meat and vanilla. The palate has black cherry, plum, bacon and chocolate flavors, and the finish is smoky. Throughout there's a nice grilled character to the wine, which isn't very complicated and isn't likely to improve much with age. Drink now through 2010.",Reserva,89,30,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Ysios
133762,Spain,"This Albariño grows on you right away. The wine starts out shy and clean, almost as if it were neutral. But as it opens you'll see that citrus, saline and tropical fruit flavors emerge. By the time it's fully unraveled the wine is smooth as glass, comfortable and just right for drinking now.",Brandal,89,15,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Adegas D'Altamira
133767,Spain,"Ripe, tropical and laced with pineapple, nectarine, green banana and melon. This is the best Don Olegario we've had in the past three vintages, and that's because it's here in the year after harvest, as it should be. Thus it's fresh, smooth and tight, with hints of petrol, pepper and citrus pith toughening up the finish. Drink now.",NA,89,22,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Don Olegario
133807,Spain,"Minty, chocolaty notes add something to the wine's floral, berry aromas, while the acid-driven palate sports zingy black cherry and plum flavors that come with coconut, vanilla and chocolate shadings, all evidence of some well-applied oak. Cleansing, acidic and nicely done for a bargain-priced wine.",NA,87,10,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,Paso a Paso
133809,Spain,"Smooth and ripe smelling, with clean berry aromas. Cherry, plum and pepper are the lead flavors, and the feel is tangy, zippy and clampy, but exceedingly fresh. Not a lot of richness, depth or body here, but it's pure, clean wine with common appeal.",Menguante,87,14,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Tempranillo,Viñedos y Bodegas Pablo
133813,Spain,"Solid Mencía, but a little on the generic, bland side. The body is medium, the tannins mellow, and the flavors are your standard dark berry. The finish is easygoing but doesn't offer much pizzazz or lasting impressions. Fresh, no-nonsense Bierzo for everyday drinking.",Legus,86,13,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Bodega La Serrana
133814,Spain,"Floral and a bit mineral, but also a tiny bit hot and rough. The palate is sweet, solid and slightly sharp in feel, with dark, baked-fruit flavors of plum and berry. A robust finish with a touch of burn closes things out.",Sol de Levante,86,11,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Bodegas Bleda
133867,Spain,"The nose kicks up ginger ale and a touch of lime, and that's followed by apple and mild citrus flavors. The mouthfeel is good and the finish crisp, clean and full of vibrant acidity. A perfectly fine and pleasant cava, but nothing out of the ordinary.",Brut,86,13,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,1+1=3
133871,Spain,"Full and fruity as well as dense and structured. Not bad for an inexpensive Spanish red. The palate is fairly smooth but also a tad bit juicy. Chocolate, coffee and a dryness work the palate. Even shows some finesse along the way.",NA,86,7,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Infinitus
133877,Spain,"Lemon peel and zesty raspberry aromas greet you, and next in line comes a mouthful of sharp red-fruit flavors that are tangy and juicy. This represents the fresh, almost austere side of Tempranillo. It's also similar to most 2002s, which are more lean and tart than average.",Crianza,86,14,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Mayor
133881,Spain,"Yeasty and round, with aromas of citrus and spent campfire. The palate runs toward peach and cantaloupe with a brown sugar coating. A bit sweet and candied late, yet mouthfilling and pleasant.",Rosado Seco,86,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Castellblanch
133888,Spain,"Very round and candied, with a ton of vanilla on the nose. It's made in the supersweet style, as if it's supposed to go with wedding cake or caramel bon bons. Yet there's enough balance to keep it on an even keel, which should make it perfect for those raised on candy-sweet wines and their kin. Certainly not to everyone's liking but not a poorly made wine by any means.",Spumante,86,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
133892,Spain,"When in doubt, you can always trust Dry Sack. As always, this is a powerful, rich Sherry with burnt sugar and heavily toasted coffee and caramel flavors. It's no softie courtesy of heat and acidity, and at all points it mixes its sweet side with tough, roasted intensity. Great for cigar smokers.",Drysack Solera Especial Sweet Old Olorosso Aged 15 Years,90,25,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Williams & Humbert
133913,Spain,"Excellent Ribera crianza here. It has a smooth, appealing bouquet of candied berry fruit, which is followed by a rich palate of cassis, black cherry, prune, chocolate and coffee. For the price point this is right on the money; it's ripe but also really good and ready to drink.",Crianza,90,16,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Mayor
133963,Spain,"A new take on Harveys Bristol Cream. Instead of you adding a twist of orange with the final pour, they've done it for you. But as with many infused drinks, the aromas are kind of artificial and the flavors run straight to candied and never come back. Worth a go if you like orange as a lead flavor—serve on the rocks.",Orange Apéritif,84,15,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Harveys
133973,Spain,"Verdejo and Viura comprise this mineral- and pepper-tinged wine. The palate is clean but a touch blanced out and drying. Flavors of citrus, apple and banana transform into walnut and aging cider on the finish.",Verdejo-Viura,84,11,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,White Blend,Vacceos
133976,Spain,"Heavily stewed and raisiny, almost to the point of no return. And while the wine is definitely cooked and starchy, it rallies on the palate and finish to show some decent Priorat-style richness and flavor. But let's face it, the wine is 80% baked and won't last for much longer.",Plan B,83,19,Catalonia,Terra Alta,NA,Red Blend,Celler La Bollidora
133987,Spain,"Smoky like BBQ, with dried fruits, leather and heat. Maybe a bit too exuberant in how it hits the palate; the fruit is a touch tangy and clipped, while the tannins are persistent if anything. A touchy, prickly wine that will do well with grilled meats.",Grand Reserva,87,105,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,Matarromera
133989,Spain,"Nicely done, a touch soft, but strong as a whole. The nose shows some typical Arienzo earth and stewiness, while the balanced palate is meaty but fresh enough, with good berry fruit resting on a bed of firm tannins and proper acids. Not a complicated wine; it's classic Rioja.",Crianza,87,23,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marques de Arienzo
133996,Spain,"This Tempranillo-dominated red (it includes 25% Graciano) is oaky and drying, with cinnamon and basic red-fruit aromas on the bouquet. The palate is tannic and solid, with raspberry, plum and spice. Turns increasingly oaky toward the end, with a rush of butter. Round and generally well balanced, yet nothing out of the ordinary.",Reserva,87,60,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Delius
134004,Spain,"Typical Garnacha-Tempranillo rosado, with fresh berry aromas and bright peach, nectarine and apple flavors. More lean and streamlined than bulky, so you won't find much in the way of red-fruit character. Clean, persistent and fresh.",NA,87,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Rosé,El Coto
134009,Spain,"Light raspberry along with charred wood carries the modest nose. Additional raspberry flavors blend with sweeter strawberry tastes to create a mildly creamy, easygoing palate. Finishes fairly buttery, with toast and popcorn notes. An attempt at a major-league wine that is semi-successful.",Reserve,87,28,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Darien
134021,Spain,"This blend of Tempranillo, Merlot, Cabernet and Graciano has a sultry, earthy, almost minerally nose that's backed up by blackberry, cassis and melted brown sugar flavors. Chewy and modern, with a brawny finish that houses baked-fruit notes and a dash of chocolate.",NA,89,45,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Red Blend,Señorío de Andión
134029,Spain,"A big, ripe and earthy wine, with some baked black fruit and chocolate to the nose. Far more saturated and dense than Siruela's other Ribera wines, but amid the heft there's rich plum and roasted berry flavors and good overall balance. The finish has an herbal tinge.",Élite,89,48,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Conde de Siruela
134030,Spain,"A mixture of baked fruit, bacon, asphalt and leather aromas is impressive, and so is the bright, composed palate and its flavors of plum, raspberry and tobacco. It's crisp and zesty, which is probably reflective of the cool 2002 vintage, but still it's a very nice wine with depth and dexterity. Drink now.",Vendimia Seleccionada,89,48,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Luis Alegre
134044,Spain,"Muruve is a label worth watching in Toro. The wines are not as brawny and robust as some, and instead they offer more reserved pleasures. This reserva shows coconut and black plum aromas, with very ripe but structured black fruit flavors. Coffee and vanilla flood the finish, and overall the wine is raring to go now and over the next few years.",Reserva,89,19,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Muruve
134051,Spain,"Clean and only ever so slightly waxy, with yellow-fruit aromas, mineral and floral scents all coming together. The palate is crisp, zesty and stony, with fresh Golden Delicious apple and tangerine flavors. All in all, the sum is more than satisfying. Drink as soon as possible.",NA,88,15,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Cálago
134080,Spain,"A nice little wine for easy times. The light citrus aromas lean toward grapefruit, while the fresh, mild palate features apple and tangerine flavors but very little sharpness. Zesty enough on the finish, with a lasting taste of passion fruit.",Verdejo-Sauvignon Blanc,86,9,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,White Blend,Bodegas Copaboca
134081,Spain,"Raisiny and sweeet smelling, with baked qualities but also a bitter bite of horseradish. The palate is deep and hard, with burnt notes, tough tannins and berry flavors softened by buttery oak. Beefy and rubbery, but with enough ripeness to be worth a look.",Gran Colegiata Campus,86,38,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Fariña
134085,Spain,"Blackberry and other fruits are presented clearly on the nose, while the rubbery, bouncy palate seems properly tight and balanced. Sweet, stretched-out flavors of black plum and berry are warm and youthful. Good for basic drinking.",NA,86,13,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Legado Muñoz
134098,Spain,"Magenta-colored, berry loaded and fresh, all of which help what could be a pedestrian wine reach a higher plane. Sweet cherry and plum flavors mix with snappy acidity and good structure, and overall you get a refreshing, satisfying wine with genuine appeal.",Protocolo,86,7,Central Spain,Tierra de Castilla,NA,Red Blend,Dominio de Eguren
134132,Spain,"Round up front, with solid fruit aromas mixed with oak and vanilla. In the mouth, it features bold cherry and raspberry flavors supported by zesty acidity and bold tannins. Finishes full, with a lot of oak-driven butter. More than competent.",Real Reserva,86,25,Northern Spain,Cigales,NA,Tempranillo,Museum
134134,Spain,"Deep and secure on the nose, with richness and a strong whiff of fresh leather. The palate is serious as it deals black fruit and spice. Chocolate and rugged tannins carry the hard, almost grabby finish. A power¬ful but approachable blend.",El Miracle 120,86,10,Levante,Valencia,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Vicente Gandia
134148,Spain,"Much more spicy and nuanced than most cavas, whether we're talking rosado or not. This one begins with aromas of black gumdrops and orange drink. The palate echoes the nose as it displays star anise and Sambuca flavors along with distant citrus. A different breed that's both odd and intriguing.",Brut Rosé,86,16,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Pinot Noir,Juvé y Camps
134150,Spain,"Tight-grained oak on top of slightly herbal fruit gives this wine an Old World bouquet. Juicy cherry, raspberry and olive flavors work the palate, followed by an acidic, drying finish that lasts for quite a while. Lean and zesty; this has definite merits.",Reserva,86,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Baron De Ley
134153,Spain,"Open on the bouquet, with a pleasant spiciness. The flavors veer toward tangy nectarine and apricot, while the snappy finish is long and slightly bitter. Shows good citrus character and plenty of pop. Quite good for a white from central Spain.",NA,86,10,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Viura,Finca Antigua
134155,Spain,"This is a perfectly good, fairly dark Garnacha that oozes bacon smoke and blueberry syrup aromas. The palate is mildly zesty due to adequate acidity, while the blackberry flavors carry a certain savory quality along with firm tannins.",Tintorera,86,9,Central Spain,Almansa,NA,Garnacha,Castillo de Almansa
134156,Spain,"Round and balanced, with a nice mix of cherry, spice and leather on the bouquet. The palate comes across as totally fresh and zesty, with ample red fruit pumped up by acidity that creates a slight citric character. Racy and crisp wine; nice with chorizo or other basic foods.",Glorioso Crianza,86,11,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Palacio
134157,Spain,"Sweet black fruit starts up the engine, and beyond that it mostly tastes like raspberry and plum. Quite big and fruity, with a peppery streak to the finish. Registers full but a bit tough, with some tannic bite.",Ars Nova,86,25,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Red Blend,Tandem
134234,Spain,"Big, bulky and struggling for balance. The alcohol is 15.5% and we can't say that it wears it well. The nose is sulfuric and smells quite a bit like spent fireworks, and after that match stick quality blows off what's left is mostly black fruit, extract, tannin and heat. 450 cases made.",Noster,83,19,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,La Perla del Priorat
134236,Spain,Simple on the nose and like biting into a green apple when you taste it. There isn't much structure or grab to the wine; it's more like a wet wash of the mouth that finishes like ginger ale. An easy game to solve; drink now.,NA,83,20,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Orballo
134260,Spain,"Dark in color. Cherry, raspberry and a touch of innertube rubber carry the nose toward a ripe palate featuring red apple and raspberry flavors. Finishes crisp and zesty, with nice acidity and commendable purity. Imported by Quality Wines of Spain.",Rosé,86,14,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Lealtanza
134262,Spain,"Cherry cough drop, leather and moss aromas open it up, followed by red raspberry and some natural bitterness. Finishes with some gritty tannin and a slightly cooked, raisiny aftertaste. More of a throwback in style.",Reserva,86,16,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Montecillo
134263,Spain,"Light and moderately oaky, with dry, herbal accents to the red-fruit aromas that are dominant. Light cherry and strawberry are the key flavors, and they're backed by notes of toast, chocolate and leather. Classic and solid, especially for a down year.",Crianza,86,14,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Marqués de Cáceres
134273,Spain,"Needs ample air to shake its early stewy, earthy character, and even then it recedes into a place best described as traditional. That means the nose is rustic, leathery and oaky, and the fruit is reserved, teetering toward drying and fading. A throwback with merits and demerits.",Gran Reserva,86,28,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Palacio
134275,Spain,"Round and ripe, with a touch of rich prune and warm earth on the spice-cabinet nose. Fairly oaky, with coconut and raspberry flavors. That coconutty character sticks with it through the finish, which is slightly tannic.",Crianza,86,14,Northern Spain,Cigales,NA,Tinto del Pais,Museum
134281,Spain,"The aromas are powerful and just the slightest bit brambly. A little hot and rugged on the palate, but loaded with prime black fruit, pepper and mocha notes. It's a potent wine with meaty blackness and plenty of raw power. With 65,000 cases produced, it's not a “boutique” wine, as evidenced by the friendly price tag.",Crianza,89,16,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Muruve
134345,Spain,"Consistency is apparently not Fransola's calling card. One year it's pungent and green, and then in a warm year like 2006 it's fruity, ripe and sweet, with green apple, pear and tropical fruit flavors making their mark. Seems like Sauvignon Blanc in Catalonia needs ample heat to show the ginger, lime and apple characteristics that make it a likable. In this case, that's mostly what's on display.",Fransola,88,29,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Sauvignon Blanc,Torres
134349,Spain,"Crushed floral aromas, berry-infused tea and cherry candy aromas give this wine a sweet profile. The palate, however, is anything but. It pounds with toasty black fruit, licorice and fiery menthol. The feel is a bit tannic but not terribly harsh, so maybe another three to five years will serve it well.",Volvoreta Probus,88,25,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Nuntia Vini
134353,Spain,"The essence of 2005 is captured in this creamy, rich offering that touches up against overripe but pulls back into balance at the last moment. Expect soft tannins, lots of coconutty oak and molasses notes along with a limited but easygoing finish. Drink soon.",y Llanahermosa,88,45,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Montecastro
134356,Spain,"A solid wine with mineral, white pepper and waxy fruit aromas. The palate is ripe and bulky, but also acidic enough to be balanced and stylish. Pineapple is the forceful flavor, while the finish is full and slightly oily. Drink this fruity, bigger-framed Albariño now.",NA,88,22,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,A2O
134357,Spain,"Abelis Carthago's top wine, Fighting Bulls, is also its toughest to enjoy. There's overripeness and barnyard on the nose, and thus the prune, black plum and jammy berry flavors that control the palate are not surprising. Big and forceful for sure, but also choppy and incongruent across the palate.",Fighting Bulls,88,60,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Abelis Carthago
134358,Spain,"Ripe and honeyed, but also nicely balanced by flower blossom aromas and acidic zest on the palate. For straightforward apricot and peach flavors, this wine serves its purpose. It's smooth, sweet and easygoing, and overall it's just elegant and lively enough to jostle your palate.",Miguel Asensio Vino Dulce de Moscatel,88,22,Spain Other,Spain,NA,Moscatel,Asensio
134363,Spain,"Early aromas of wintergreen, pepper and autumn leaves are joined by plum and cherry sweetness on the palate. The wine opens fairly quickly into a bright, juicy, lively package that offers grabby tannins, a touch of coarseness and zest. Should drink well for the next four or five years.",Selección de Familia,88,16,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Faustino
134367,Spain,"There's no denying the wine's raisiny ripeness; it's confirmed via Sherry/Port aromas and black plum/baked fruit flavors. But it's not simply a heavyweight on its last legs. To the contrary, the wine delivers a jolt of core intensity and finishing notes of spicy black pepper and licorice. Drink right away.",Reserva,88,19,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marqués de la Concordia
134397,Spain,"Gaseous, earthy, mossy aromas are not entirely inviting, and the palate is immensely thick and round, with big, grating tannins. But the plum, berry and meaty elements are good, and the finish of chewy tannins goes on for quite some time. An extracted wine with minor balance and aromatic issues.",Gotín del Risc,86,17,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Abad
134399,Spain,"Banana, lemon curd and sawdust are the prime aromas on this oaky, creamy, candied style of Chard from Navarra. The palate is soft and modern, with decent core acidity propping up papaya, melon and green banana flavors. Resiny on the finish, but smooth.",NA,86,14,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Chardonnay,Vega Sindoa
134407,Spain,"Another winner from Emilio Moro. The nose is a touch minty and very spicy, but the black fruit element is there and overall the bouquet sings of integration. Pure, enthralling and big, with monster black fruit flavors, complexity, rich oak and a long, smooth finish. Stylish yet powerful; drink from 2013 through 2020.",Malleolus de Sanchomartin,94,205,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto Fino,Emilio Moro
134439,Spain,"Red fruit, hints of spice and a touch of herbal essence kick it off. The palate is leafy and drying, with medium-ripe cherry and berry flavors. Quite your basic red table wine, and if that's what you're looking for it's not disappointing.",Gran Feudo Crianza,85,11,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Julián Chivite
134440,Spain,"Heavy, with a lot of oak, which is reflected in both the amber color and the aromas. Flavors of vanilla, lemon drop, banana and wood resin take a moment or two to get used to, but they grow on you. Not a lot of complexity or breadth, but interesting for what it is.",Conde de Valdemar Blanco,85,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Viura,Bodegas Valdemar
134441,Spain,"Attractive on the nose, with violet, cherry and a bit of candy. Round and satisfying in the mouth, with full berry flavors and mouthcoating tannins. Not all that nuanced or complex, but good in a dense, hit-me sort of way.",NA,85,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Merlot,Legado Muñoz
134446,Spain,"A touch minty and rustic, but with enough black cherry, marmalade and tannin to make the grade. Jammy, medium in density and solid. A stout, friendly red made for early drinking.",NA,85,10,Central Spain,Madrid,NA,Tempranillo,Merum
134450,Spain,"Warm and earthy, with a round, ripe nose. The palate is a touch on the sweet, cooked side, but it avoids being stewy or soupy and instead shows ripe black fruit, licorice and smoked meat. Quite soft and low in acid. Drink right away.",Crianza,85,12,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Red Blend,Finca Antigua
134457,Spain,"A sweet, almost punch-bowl nose greets you, followed by mellow apple and tropical fruit flavors. Medium-bodied and generally balanced, with shy but layered flavors and dryness that offers a bit of complexity.",NA,85,12,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Viña Mocen
134475,Spain,"Opens with rooty, mature aromas of tobacco, baked berry and raisin, while the palate is full and roasted, with sweet baked-plum and brown sugar flavors. Mature and ready to go, with head-to-toe sweetness and molasses accents. Not a hard, tannic wine. Drink now through 2012.",Montsalvat,89,79,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Francesc Sanchez Bas
134524,Spain,"“Light” is misleading, because this really isn't a light fino at all. In fact, it's rather heavy and clunky, with a salty undercurrent to its lemon and nut flavors. Tastes more cooked than ideal.",Fino Light,83,15,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Harveys
134541,Spain,"Cola, cherry and mint aromas give reason for optimisim, but the palate is extraordinarily hard and acidic. Thus the flavors are of lemony citrus more than Tempranillo, and the feel is stark as nails. You can see certain positives but balance and mouthfeel aren't among them.",Prima,82,40,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Portia
134550,Spain,"Violet and blackberry aromas are an inviting first act, while the palate is lush and fairly deep, with thick blackberry and mildly brambly flavors.

134552,Spain,"Dark plum aromas are sweetened and softened by oak-based coconut aromas, while the color and weight are deeper and darker than average. The palate is full, ripe, semicushioned but also acidic and vital, with black fruit, mocha and coffee notes. It finishes chocolaty, with a slight herbal note.",Finca Monasterio,88,55,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Baron De Ley
134558,Spain,"Not much different than the basic Sarria rosado, with maybe a touch more concentration and richness. The nose is a bit dusty, with good berry fruit notes and a whiff of cherry blossom. The palate is wet and fresh, with raspberry and plum-skin flavors. Crisp and refreshing.",Viñedo N° 5 Rosé,88,14,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Garnacha,Señorío de Sarria
134613,Spain,"Forward and a touch racy, with moderate sweetness on the bouquet. Runs juicy and tight, with fresh, almost tart raspberry and cherry flavors. Offers the basics and not much more, but it's a balanced wine made in the traditional style, meaning it's dry, acidic and medium-bodied.",Viña Real Crianza,86,18,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,CVNE
134619,Spain,"Traditional in the way it displays molasses, tobacco and cherry cola among its aromatics. Satisfying in the mouth, with lightweight cherry supported by oak-driven vanilla. Crisp acids are keeping it healthy. Drink now for a taste of Old World Rioja.",Reserva,86,17,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Red Blend,LAN
134633,Spain,"Here's a wine that rides heavy with smoked meat and cured ham aromas. The nose is full of bacon, rubber, spice and peppery fruit and then it turns to a palate of basic strawberry and raspberry. Short on the finish, with a touch of vanilla.",Primum Vitae Reserva,86,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Vallformosa
134643,Spain,"A bigger wine at 14.5%, this offers the full allotment of leather, crude oil, violet petals and cassis.

134653,Spain,"The importance of a great vintage is evident in this crianza holdover from the lauded 2001 harvest.

Will go well with food; drink now.",Crianza,88,22,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Torrederos
134658,Spain,"Classic old-school Gran Reserva. The nose is full of barbecue, molasses and dried plum, while the palate has complexities in the form of tobacco, tire rubber and earth. It goes somewhat citrusy and quick on the finish, ending in a wash of orange-infused leather and chocolate. Drink now or hold for another 5 years.",Gran Reserva,88,25,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marques de Arienzo
134659,Spain,"Dark and sultry on the nose, with aromas of burnt toast and raisin that hint at ripeness and some serious oak aging. The wine is juicy yet also a little creamy, with raspberry and plum flavors that are broad and flow nicely across the palate and onto the wide, chewy finish.",Reserva,88,25,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Ramón Bilbao
134665,Spain,"Quite ripe for a traditional crianza. The bouquet starts out on the stewy side but soon sheds its weight to reveal flavors of blackberry, black cherry and earth. The mouthfeel is a bit creamy due to the wine's mild oak and overall ripeness. Drink now through 2010.",Viña Real Crianza,88,18,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,CVNE
134672,Spain,"A good taste of Toro at the right price. The nose deals classic baked fruit, rubber and girth, while the warm, full palate shows reasonable vitality along with berry and cassis flavors. Solid and a little chocolaty on the finish. A textbook warm-climate Spanish wine.",Auroch,86,12,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Tribal
134691,Spain,"Perfectly drinkable Monastrell year after year despite the silly name. Plum and roasted berry aromas and flavors are sweet, ripe, clean and on the generic side of the fence. A little rugged and hot at 15%, but lusty and good for the price.",NA,86,8,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Wrongo Dongo
134704,Spain,"For the most part this is a full-bodied, full-fruited wine that has what it takes to win people over. The nose is full of cherry, plum, licorice and coconut, while the palate is bright and ripe. It's a bit clumsy and not all that complex, but you can't knock the power and extract.",Reserva,85,15,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Red Blend,Finca Antigua
134710,Spain,"This is a good table wine with sweet, woodsy aromas of sandalwood, clove, cinnamon and earth. The palate turns a bit to the tangy, sharp side. But in a world with so many overripe heavyweights, this edgy, almost racy blend has the right stuff.",NA,85,10,Central Spain,Castilla La Mancha,NA,Shiraz-Tempranillo,Día Naciente
134714,Spain,"Smells a touch green and pasty, and while the wine is deep and dark, there isn't a whole lot of definition or specificity to it. Sweet and heavy in the mouth, with chocolate notes. Creamy on the finish, with minimal flavor. Not bad but doesn't have an identifiable personality.",NA,85,45,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Valpiculata
134716,Spain,"Round in style, with soft white-fruit and apple blossom aromas. Tastes a touch reduced, as if the lemon, lime and melon flavors had been condensed and amplified. The finish is lively, with citrus and some pithiness. Good but limited.",NA,85,13,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Lagar de Costa
134720,Spain,"Fairly big and muscular, with black fruit, cinnamon and olive notes on the nose. The palate is beefy and deep, with plum and blackberry flavors. With big tannins and a full-bodied personality, this is not a lightweight.",NA,85,10,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Merlot,Finca Antigua
134722,Spain,"Some early pickle and sauerkraut aromas were worrisome until they completely disappeared. Left in their wake are flavors of apple juice and peaches, while the mouthfeel registers as solid and full. A little funky and definitely not for everyone, given the wine's overt sweetness and oddities.",Carta Nevada Semi Dry,85,9,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
134723,Spain,"Not a complete swing and a miss, but nothing special despite the miniscule production and higher-than-normal price. The color is pale and the nose has some gaps. In the mouth, you get dry soda crackers and white-peach flavors. Finishes with lime and apple. No glaring faults but hollow.",XXI Brut,85,25,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
134726,Spain,"Fairly sweet and fruity, with notes of raspberry jam and cotton candy on the bouquet. Feels nice across the palate, with tangy strawberry and red-cherry flavors leading to a fresh, wet, bright finish. A good but pedestrian wine at a reasonable price.",Rosado de Lagrima,85,9,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Garnacha,Viña Sardasol
134735,Spain,"It's not easy to find mature Rioja from a great winery and a great year. This is all that; it smells of tobacco, earth and dried fruits. The palate is lively and not dying, while the flavors of cherry, raisin and marzipan are spot on. Compact and long on the finish, indicating that it still has another 10–15 years in it.",Prado Enea Gran Reserva,93,63,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Muga
134748,Spain,"Big and sultry as always, with bacon, smoke, black fruit and a full rack of spices making for a wonderful bouquet. Concentrated and ripped for a 2007, with blackberry, clove, pepper, cinnamon and vanilla flavors. And then comes tobacco and more spice on the finish, which is grabby but understandable because it's so young. Best from 2012 through 2019.",Malleolus de Valderramiro,93,176,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto Fino,Emilio Moro
134753,Spain,"Once again this is a stalwart modern-style Rioja with a mix of floral aromas, licorice, blackberry and coconut. The palate is both lively and subtle, and the flavor profile shows an impressive blend of cherry, plum, cream and cocoa, while the finish is long and smooth. A high-quality wine that should impress. Drink now through 2015.",NA,93,62,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,San Vicente
134767,Spain,"A dry, oily, piquant Oloroso that's more peanutty than almondy. The palate is racy due to no shortage of acidity, and the flavor profile is led by a salty, briney almond and leather character. Sheer and serious, with not a sugar cube in sight.",Alfonso Oloroso Seco,89,18,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Palomino,González Byass
134783,Spain,"A bit heavy and raisiny, but with that said there's no denying the wine's richness and ripeness. Lush and dense in the mouth, with cocoa, roasted fruit and a mild syrupy lean to the flavor profile. Sweet but a little short on the finish, and condensed. Drink now through 2012.",Tinto Figuero 12 Crianza,89,29,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,García Figuero
134856,Spain,"Penascal has emerged as one of those value brands that delivers. This installment of Tempranillo is full of berry, prune and leather aromas, while the palate is creamy and rather full, with smooth berry notes and more than adequate richness.",NA,86,7,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo,Penascal
134865,Spain,"Fairly deep and dark, with ripe plum and blackberry aromas. Transitions to meaty black cherry and plum flavors, which are followed by a round finish accented by chocolate and mocha. Medium to full-bodied; good value in basic red wine.",NA,85,7,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Shiraz,Penascal
134866,Spain,"Perfectly nice and fresh, with fruity springtime aromas that offers slight touches of nettle and citrus. Tropical flavors emerge from the spritzy palate, while the finish is both sweet and spicy. Shows some residual sugar but not too much. Imported by HAB North America.",Rosé,85,7,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo,Penascal
134867,Spain,"Talk about a colorful, bold, jammy red! It's heavily extracted and, as the label notes, young as can be. The fruit is heavy, dark to the point of teeth-staining, and tannic. Not sophisticated or meant for fine dining, but full of fruit and life. Tastes good but is unequivocally rambunctious.",Young,85,12,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Rubiejo
134871,Spain,"Mildly leafy, with root beer and red fruit comprising the nose. Basic but fresh in the mouth, with cherry and berry flavors, medium tannins and a laudable mouthfeel. Middle-of-the-road in terms of power, with finishing notes of tobacco and smoke.",Crianza,85,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Campo Viejo
134876,Spain,"Hard leather and smoke aromas are the opening salvo, and there's plenty of warm earth and cedar below deck. The palate is herbal and peppery, with a touch of burnt grass and green pepper sparring with plum and berry. Finishes a bit hot but ultimately it's a solid, old-school Rioja.",Reserva,85,29,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Lealtanza
134913,Spain,"Admittedly we are tasting this later than we'd prefer, but for an '07 it is still showing vital signs and attractive aromas of sugared pastry, candied apple and lemon-lime. The palate is mostly fresh, though not as lively as it probably was nine months ago, while the flavors of 7Up and peach are refreshing. Drink immediately or wait until the 2008 arrives.",Dona Rosa,88,25,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Adega Martínez Serantes
134938,Spain,"The “value” label from Condes de Albarei is always a good bet. Oceanic aromas and a spritz of lime make the nose just right, and the lively palate of lemon, melon and banana is charged up. Tight on the finish, with citrus and almond skins, and then a lasting impression of pineapple. Young and raring to go.",Salneval,88,10,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Condes de Albarei
134941,Spain,"The under-$10 high scorer is fast disappearing, so take a good look at this young, jammy Tempranillo-Shiraz blend that hits nicely with ripe boysenberry and black plum. The Shiraz seems to have darkened the wine, and the mouthfeel is ripe and lush.",Tempranillo + Shiraz,88,8,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Volteo
134948,Spain,"Cabernet Sauvignon and Monastrell made in a ripe, high-alcohol style results in monster aromas of shoe polish and black licorice. The palate is a wave of chocolate and candied black fruits that crashes into a heavy, ultraripe finish of prune and pepper. A lunker wine with a sweet smile and a big handshake.",NA,88,130,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Cabernet Blend,El Nido
134950,Spain,"This wine's nose bears an uncanny similarity to animal crackers, and along the way there's peach and melon aromas. The palate is sweet and slightly punchy, with mango and white raisin flavors. Overall, bank on sweetness and liquidy ripeness from this drink-now Albariño.",NA,88,23,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Fulget
134954,Spain,"Spicy wood notes and black fruit vie for center stage on the ripe, semimature bouquet. This is more of a traditional Ribera wine, meaning it has textured tannins, notes of tobacco and dill, and leathery, earthy berry fruit flavors. Not at all rough and ready to drink now, but still it should hold into 2009.",Reserva,88,25,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Condado de Oriza
134960,Spain,"Clean and focused up front, with appealing cola, cherry and plum aromas. If you like wild berry flavors and juicy, borderline aggressive acidity, then Deyo fits your request. It's a fairly rough, spunky wine with finishing notes of espresso and bitter chocolate. Should match well with salty, robust foods.",Deyo,87,15,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Merlot,Castillo de Monjardin
134963,Spain,"Mature and a little waxy on the nose; this is a plump, fruity, semisoft wine with apple, pineapple and melon flavors. It's round and fairly mild, with plenty of taste, width and drinkability. Drink soon before it softens even further.",El Bino,87,13,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,El Bully
134965,Spain,"Ripe grapefruit aromas take care of the nose, while the palate shows smooth-edged citrus and grapefruit flavors. For a warm-vintage wine, this one is holding in pretty well; it has a plump body but enough liveliness to do what it should with food. Drink now; it's not getting any better.",NA,87,18,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Aura
134974,Spain,"Big boysenberry aromas are lively, a bit minty and fresh, while the extracted palate has a fruit-driven personality, ample tannins and dark wild-berry flavors. Young, bouncy and tangy on the finish. Composed for a young, inexpensive red.",NA,85,6,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,Venta Morales
134976,Spain,"Opens with sweet berry and plum aromas and later there's earthy heft. The palate is big, acidic and fruity, with bold, stretched-out berry flavors. Finishes with a touch of bitterness and rubber, but overall it's a perfectly solid, grapey, tightly wound wine.",NA,85,10,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,Rojo Mojo
134980,Spain,"Decent and quaffable but does not compare to the winery's Verdejo. This is prickly and full of pine needle, juniper and other sharp aromas. The palate has a good feel but pickled, briney flavors. Skeletal given its warm-climate origins.",NA,85,11,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Sauvignon Blanc,Montespina
134999,Spain,"Raspberry and rubber aromas are solid if not refined, while the firm palate is sweet and full of black cherry flavor. Rough, tumble and unsophisticated in the mouthfeel department but ripe and tasty throughout, with dark shadings on the finish.",Peromato,85,9,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Fariña
135015,Spain,"A pure and intense rendition of Priorato. The nose is stacked with minerality, smoke, ink and tough but regal black fruit aromas. It's powerful and concentrated in the mouth, with bold cassis and blackberry flavors in front of a long, flavorful, slightly lemony finish. Needs a few years to show its best; drink from 2011 through 2017.",Mas Sinén Coster,92,74,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Celler Burgos-Porta
135016,Spain,"A big-time Priorato with tobacco, minerality and dark fruit aromas in front of a lush and smooth palate full of cola, blackberry and licorice flavors. There's all the power you could ask for but also complexity and layering that set up a minerally finish of mocha and coffee. Drink from 2011 through 2015.",Pissarres,92,34,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Costers del Priorat
135034,Spain,"For years this wine was a big-time bargain from Navarra. Now it's not so inexpensive yet the quality is the same. There's common nectarine and raspberry aromas before snappy peach and berry flavors. It's juicy and modest, with crispness and a drying finish.",Gran Feudo Rosé,85,12,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Garnacha,Bodegas Julián Chivite
135035,Spain,"Light and modest in aromas, although scents of citrus blossom and nectarine manage to work their way to the top of the bouquet. The palate is smooth and creamy, with flavors of red plum, melon and chocolate. A good wine that won't make you go crazy looking for complexities and depth.",Rosado,85,14,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Bohigas
135039,Spain,"Plump and full of plum and licorice aromas. Weighs in big and a touch sweet, with black cherry and ripe plum flavors. Very soft in the feel department, with a soft finish that's like a cushioned fall. Healthy as a whole, with lively tannins.",Old Vines,85,16,Spain Other,Spain,NA,Grenache-Syrah,Merum
135042,Spain,"This full-bodied, cherry-dominated Garnacha is pretty good considering the price. The nose is a bit raisiny and ripe, while the palate is sweet but balanced. A standard red wine with clarity and no surprises.",NA,84,6,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Garnacha,Castillo de Monséran
135052,Spain,"This Monastrell-based rosado is indicative of the Jumilla region, meaning it's sweet, a bit heavy, and fairly candied in its aromas. Flavors of fleshy raspberry and strawberry are full, while the round finish is neutral. Low in acid; drink right away.",Rosado,84,10,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Rosé,Alceño
135056,Spain,"Sweet and floral, like light berries with crushed flower petals. The palate is not as comforting; it's acidic and bouncy, which fosters good flavors but a jagged, jumpy mouthfeel. You want to like this wine but the feel doesn't make it easy.",Reserva,84,11,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,NA,Tempranillo,Laguna de la Nava
135059,Spain,"Pretty good for a $6 sparkler, even if the nose has a whiff of rubber band and wet clay to go along with light citrus and cherry aromas. The palate is fruity and carbonated, so you get spritz with your cherry, strawberry and tangerine flavors. Good for sparkling Sangria as well as casual sipping.",Mediterranean Pétillant,84,6,Catalonia,Catalonia,NA,Rosé,René Barbier
135064,Spain,"Earthy and crusty at first, with smoked meat, black fruit and dryness to the nose. The palate is well formed and proper, with dry raspberry and mild chocolate flavors. Finishes peppery and solid, with the slightest herbal note. Very nice wine to drink now through 2014.",Gran Reserva,89,NA,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Pedrosa
135081,Spain,"A super sweet, potent brew that takes no prisoners as it hits with powerful toffee, caramel and alcohol aromas. Good in the mouth because it's not gritty, but very sweet on the palate, with honey, brown sugar and cinnamon flavors. If sweet is your thing, then add a point or two to our score.",Esnobista Moscatel Pasa,88,20,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L.
135087,Spain,"Having really liked this wine a couple of years ago, this vintage seems comparatively fierce and aggressive, which isn't to say it isn't hugely flavorful and aromatic. On the down side, it's residue-heavy and tannic, with full extraction and tannic berry fruit. Tough as nails; maybe it just needs a couple of years to settle.",NA,88,90,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Paixar
135088,Spain,"Opens with rich aromas of raisin, licorice, black plum and molasses that put it on the cusp of overripe. The palate is rich and gritty, with deep berry and molasses flavors. Generous for sure, but also slightly baked and sweet. Tastes like a warm-climate, warm-vintage wine. Drink now.",La Montesa,88,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Palacios Remondo
135089,Spain,"Raspberry and plum aromas carry a mild floral, perfumed accent, while the palate is medium in weight, with good flow due to lively acidity. Flavors of red fruits are equalized by oaky vanilla and dry herbs, while the finish is lengthy and snappy due to aforementioned core acidity.",Reserva,88,25,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Mayor
135153,Spain,"A touch timid in how it doles out slight raspberry and light oak aromas. And that's in front of a mellow, quiet palate that offers basic berry flavors and not much more. Far from the most cushioned, lush wine going; it hits firmly and evenly, like a welterweight from a past era.",Reserva,85,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Campo Viejo
135155,Spain,"Basic, fresh and fruity, with floral aromas that capture the essence of clean, tank-made Viura. Flavors of melon, banana and papaya are easy to like but not that serious, while the finish is soft and creamy, but not very intense.",Monopole,85,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,CVNE
135158,Spain,"Once again this Viura ranks as one of the better values in white Rioja. It deals a punchbowl bouquet of round melon and pineapple, while the dry but fresh palate pushes green melon and white pepper. Limited in what it can offer but good for what it costs.",NA,85,7,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Viura,Marqués de Cáceres
135162,Spain,"Encouraging aromas of earth, leather, plum and berry lead to a rather sheer, zesty palate of blackberry, cherry and acid. It's tight in the mouth, with cheeky tannins and friction. Quite extracted and oaky; requires food or will seem astringent.",NA,85,25,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Red Blend,Tarsus
135171,Spain,"For years Ysios has been one of Spain's most architecturally astounding wineries, but its wines have lagged. This is not a new wine, so it falls into that simple, basic category. It's aging decently, showing citrus, root beer and tobacco. Good but midland.",Reserva,85,30,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Red Blend,Ysios
135176,Spain,"A sniff delivers aromas of dried fruits along with a smack of toast and char. Runs light to medium across the palate, with cranberry and raspberry rising as the primary flavors. Definitely a flyweight made in the traditional style. A new release that seems more mature than it is. Drink right away, preferably with food.",Crianza,85,16,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,CVNE
135177,Spain,"Easy and fruity, with light cherry aromas. Juicy on the palate, with raspberry, apple skin and plum flavors. Zesty as they go, with good natural acidity and ample freshness.",Crianza,85,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Palacio
135219,Spain,"In general O. Fournier gets it right, be it in Spain or Argentina. But this Ribera del Duero struggles from the outset. It's rubbery, damp and lacks clarity of fruit. And the feel is sharp and lemony, seemingly a combo of excessive oak and raw fruit. Imported by Fine Wines from Spain.",Spiga,80,29,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,O. Fournier
135244,Spain,"Light but generic aromas of white fruits and white flowers give this wine a happy bouquet. The palate is starting to tip toward fading, but if you get at it soon you'll find perfectly nice peach, melon and citrus flavors setting up a soft, easygoing finish.",Terra d'Ouro,87,20,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Pazo De Villarei
135253,Spain,"Just a bit mulchy on the nose, which signals that is a wine from the hot 2003 vintage. The palate sits on raisin and mocha, and there's even a creamy, thick feel to it. If you like rich, Porty flavors that border on dessert, it's likable. But be prepared for it to hit with a thud.",Reserva,87,49,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Alidis
135257,Spain,"Inky dark, with deep berry, sandalwood and sawmill aromas. Color and potency are not lacking in this modern-styled Tempranillo, which hits like a hammer. Feelwise, this is a tough, angular wine that will benefit from another year or two of aging. Now it's very tight and tannic, with piercing acidity.",MC,87,46,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marqués de Cáceres
135265,Spain,"Castilla y León can be good bargain country, and all of the 2006 Volteo wines are Best Buy qualifiers. This varietal Tempranillo has a clean, fruity nose backed by bright berry flavors built on a floor or two of structure. It's a composed quaffer with pure flavors, adequate length and overall balance.",NA,87,8,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Volteo
135303,Spain,"Smoky, grapey and spicy on the nose. The palate is full and aggressive in a bring-it-on sort of way. It's a touch heavy and tannic, but it's also pretty long and toasty on the finish.",NA,84,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Legado Muñoz
135304,Spain,"Seems like the brutal heat of 2003 got to this wine in a negative way. The result is a thick, unctuous, syrupy wine with a ton of sweetness but not much balance. The alcohol is listed at 15.5%, and it seems bigger. Very much a heavyweight, and with no agility.",El Albar Excelencia,84,40,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,J. & F. Lurton
135311,Spain,"Apple and peach define the bouquet, but where's the pop? This cava seems a touch quiet and reticent. It's drying, with flavors of apple, white corn and soda cracker. But the bead is weak and the overall personality is shy. Has 15% Chardonnay in addition to the traditional cava three-pack of Macabeo, Parellada and Xarello.",Gran Reserva Brut Nature,84,18,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Bohigas
135315,Spain,"Sweet cherry and berry aromas are blended with cookie dough scents to create a simple, easy bouquet.

Shows some kick and tannins at its core.",NA,84,7,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Infinitus
135316,Spain,"Slightly amber in color, with pastry, peach and pear aromas. The palate is tangy, with flavors of green apple along with some bitterness. Finishes light and dry, with zest and freshness. Simple yet solid.",Chardonnay-Viura,84,7,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,White Blend,Infinitus
135347,Spain,"Really nice and lush, with an aromatic mix of tobacco, baked fruit, mocha, vanilla, shoe polish, earth and more. It displays a ripe, friendly feel and yummy flavors of mocha, chocolate and savory, subtle berry fruits. Layered on the finish, with lasting notes of fig, mocha and blackberry. Drink now through 2012.",Expression,92,59,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Alidis
135365,Spain,"Radiator dust, baked apple and other familiar, semirich aromas grace the nose on this more elevated Cava. In the mouth, there's chunkiness, weight and integrity along with a flavor profile that hints at vinegar but settles on cidery apple and kumquat. Nicely done and different from the mass wines Freixenet is known for.",Elyssia Gran Cuvee Brut,88,18,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
135376,Spain,"Solid if a bit soupy and tomato-driven on the nose. In the mouth, there's a nice offset between herbal, red fruit characteristics, tobacco and black fruit. Overall, it's a gritty, tight, honest Ribera wine with a long, powerful finish. Just ripe enough, with indviduality and identity. Drink now through 2012.",Selección Crianza,88,18,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Fuentespina
135420,Spain,"Opens with exotic, earthy aromas and lots of black fruit, but it turns more quiet and timid with airing. The palate shows plenty of bright acidity and some heft and grab, while the flavors of dark berries and plum are accented by light herbal notes and other common Ribera accents like thyme and oregano.",Pavo Real Crianza,88,27,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Xavier Flouret
135427,Spain,"Slightly dusty, spicy and cider-like on the nose, with a tight palate holding nectarine, melon and apple flavors. It's fairly exact in terms of mouthfeel, while the finish is clean and reflects well on the wine. Drink now.",Esencia Diviña,88,23,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Adegas Gran Vinum
135480,Spain,"For an affordable Priorat this wine isn't disappointing. The nose is a bit funky and gamy, but you'll also dig out mineral, leather and bacon notes that are pleasing. Peppery and spicy more than lush and fruity, with pushy game and herbal notes on the finish.",Crianza Dara,85,14,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Sangenís I Vaqué
135482,Spain,"An organic wine with brushy aromas of tobacco, bramble and berry. Fairly true and full in the mouth, with a note of raisin to the black cherry and plum flavors. Gets better with time but always seems a bit grassy.",Crianza Organic,85,17,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Mutuo
135483,Spain,"A zealous wine with sweaty leather, prune and leftover oak on the nose. The mouth is charged up and lively as the tannins and acids meet to boost cherry and raspberry fruit. Comes across too eager and hard; needs more mouthfeel and subtlety to make the next level.",Prestigio,85,60,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,Matarromera
135484,Spain,"Murkier than ideal. The nose is heavy and earthy, and it's full of barnyard initially. The wine rests heavily on the tongue, with soft, mildly funky flavors of dark berry and stewed tomato. Seems a touch overripe and flaccid for an '01 reserva.",Reserva,84,29,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,Diez Llorente
135485,Spain,"This wine kind of misses the mark. The nose is a bit stewy and less than pure, while the palate seems tight, grabby and herbal. At times it seems like it's almost where it should be, but then you find weaknesses.",Coto de Imaz Reserva,84,21,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,El Coto
135489,Spain,"Rusty in color, which is to be expected. The nose shows dried cherry, belt leather and cigar box, and at this point all seems dandy. The palate, however, is short and stewy, with too little fruit to stand up to the prickly acids and herbal notes. Already past its prime.",Gran Reserva,84,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marques de Arienzo
135495,Spain,"Light salmon in color, with fruity, relaxed raspberry aromas. Melon and peach flavors are pleasant but dilute, while the wine weighs in a bit watery and devoid of stuffing, even for a rosado. Finishes dry but flat. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",Rosado,84,9,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Rosé,CVNE
135498,Spain,"Gets off the mark a bit chunky and soft, with heavier than usual peach and melon aromas. Melon, papaya and green banana carry the plump, full-bodied palate to a soft, easy, almost shy finish. Weighty for Verdejo.",NA,84,9,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Verdejo,Mar de Castilla
135504,Spain,"Despite the silly packaging and strange orange tint, this is a solid if unusual rosado that registers sweet but likable. It's chunky, with berry flavors and a shot of leather and animal. By no means is it elevated or for the long haul. Drink now or hold your peace. Imported by Winery Exchange.",La Rosa,84,9,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Rosé,Sideshow
135548,Spain,"Nice and familiar, and very much in the sweet, creamy style. There's almond candy and caramel on the palate and then maple syrup on the finish. Soft and sweet throughout, with just enough acidity and complexity to save it from being boring.",Oloroso Dulce Cream,87,11,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Osborne
135558,Spain,"This is Cáceres' bread-and-butter red Rioja, and the '04 is fruity, light and very approachable. The nose shows some cotton candy and other bouncy red-fruit aromas, while the palate is easygoing, fleshy and balanced by a beam of juicy acidity. Along the way, you'll pull out flavors of cherry, raspberry and a finishing note of bitter coffee.",Crianza,87,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marqués de Cáceres
135559,Spain,"Superripe, such that it's medicinal and pruny. The nose reeks of reduced blueberry and cassis, while the palate is soft, low in acidity and full of ripe, dark raisin, prune and spice cake flavors. If you like a dense wine, this is it. But expect it to be Port-like and on the liqueur-ish side. Drink now.",Estate Bottled,87,45,Central Spain,Dominio de Valdepusa,NA,Petit Verdot,Marques de Griñon
135562,Spain,"A maturing wine with aromas of burnt leaves, dill, leather and shaded black fruit. It opens up on the palate, revealing cherry, raspberry and plum flavors along with ancillary vanilla. With medium tannins and moderate acidity, the wine shows no ill effects of the broiling 2003 vintage. Drink now.",Crianza,87,15,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Condado de Oriza
135564,Spain,"Cepas Vellas refers to old vines, but what's most noticeable on this wine is the popcorn and cream that characterizes both the nose and mouth. In between the oak-aided folds there's melon, waxy papaya and banana flavors sitting on a plump, cushioned palate. It's a holdover from 2005, so drink it while you have it.",Aquis Celenis Cepas Vellas,87,18,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Fernando Diéguez Otero
135570,Spain,"Neutral for the most part, with a slight citric pungency. Tastes like apple, spice and dried papaya, and the feel is round as opposed to zesty or angular. Lasting on the back end, with a final note of grapefruit.",NA,85,13,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo-Viura,Emina
135573,Spain,"A little rusty in color, with earthy, stemmy, baked fruit aromas mixed with a dose of dried leaves. Seems a lot like Cabernet Franc with its herbal, leafy overtones and dry plum and cherry flavors. Finishes short and herbal, but with good feel and flow.",Care Crianza,85,20,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Tempranillo-Merlot,Bodegas Añadas
135574,Spain,"The nose shows buttered popcorn, toast and baked apple, while the palate is tangy and tastes of tart white fruits, green apple and toast. Has good flow and a cleansing feel to it. Not bad for an oaky blend of Viura and Chardonnay.",Becquer Blanco,85,18,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Bodegas Escudero
135578,Spain,"Floral, sweet and not the least bit complicated or strained. This is easygoing red wine for easy times. It's a bit candied and baked, but that's Garnacha from Central Spain. Decently balanced and sturdy, especially given the price tag.",NA,85,6,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Grenache,Viña Borgia
135595,Spain,"Medicinal black fruit aromas are a little burnt and brambly, while the palate is snappy, acidic and tannic, with tomato, raspberry and oak-driven creaminess. Finishes dry, with a lasting flavor of vanilla that tempers overriding acidity.",Bajoz Crianza,85,13,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tempranillo,Pagos del Rey
135600,Spain,"Round and sweet up front, with aromas of candied berries. More alert and red-fruit dominated on the palate, with snappy acidity keeping it well propped up. Finishes with bright acidity and modest tannins. Straight-ahead red wine with crispness.",NA,84,10,Central Spain,Castilla La Mancha,NA,Shiraz,Día Naciente
135601,Spain,"Black raspberry and raisin control the bouquet on this carbonically macerated wine from inland Valencia. Lively plum and black cherry work the rubbery, mildly tannic palate, while the finish is leisurely enough. A touch narrow in flavor but broad in feel.",Mi Niña,84,11,Levante,Utiel-Requena,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Iranzo
135605,Spain,"Albariño is not known for its aging potential, and this wine already seems to be on the way out. The nose veers toward apricot and cider, as does the palate. Finishes with a final kick of acidity. Drink soon, or wait for the 2005.",NA,84,21,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Don Olegario
135609,Spain,"Jammy and full of raisin, stewed berries and leather. Calling it ultraripe might be an understatement because it's nearly over the top in its heft, extract and tannin level. A high-production bruiser that has tons of power but very little precision.",Tinto Joven,84,11,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Cermeño
135612,Spain,"Hits with force as well as notes of raisin and Sherry. No doubt this comes from a hot vintage, evidenced by the prune, brandied cherry and chocolate flavors. Still there's some tannin to keep it moving ahead. Overall, however, it's pretty heavy and condensed.",Crianza,84,11,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas LAN
135624,Spain,"Mildly floral and tropical at first, but then it seems to go heavy and flat on the bouquet the longer it sits. Look for decent grapefruit and tangerine flavors on a healthy but rudimentary cassis.",NA,83,10,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,White Blend,Inspiración Pampano
135626,Spain,"The color is an odd orange, which should come as an indicator that not all is right with this wine. The bouquet starts with dust on a warming radiator, and there's some vanilla as well. Soft citrus and nectarine flavors work the palate, followed by a round but somewhat mushy finish.",Brut de Noirs,83,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
135630,Spain,"Staunch red fruit aromas are a bit prickly at first, but within a few minutes they settle on mineral, herbs, anise and licorice. The palate has a firm but pure feel, and the tannins aren't too tough at all. Flavors of cassis, cherry cough drop and raisin are deep yet narrow, and just complex enough. Drink now through 2013.",Clos de l'Obac,92,87,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Costers del Siurana
135631,Spain,"Another great Tempranillo from Sierra Cantabria? Indeed it is. The nose bleeds cedary, sweet black fruit aromas and coconut, while the palate is pure and layered, with a lush feel and rich flavors of black fruits and chocolate. Long and lasting on the finish, and delicious overall. Approachable now but ageable for at least five years.",Cuvée,92,29,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
135641,Spain,"Thoroughly modern in style, with an oaky nose of campfire, spice, vanilla, sawdust and molten berry. The palate is solid and shows good vital acidity, while the flavors of blackberry are meaty and thorough, with hints of coconut, chocolate and cream. Seems a little more balanced and interesting than FB's richer, softer Selección.",NA,91,45,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Ferrer Bobet
135651,Spain,"Concentrated and sweet, with a baked, raisiny richness that maintains its clarity. The palate is dense but not punishing or tannic. Flavors of blackberry and prune veer toward syrupy, setting up a sweet, generous finish of fig paste and coconut. Modern-styled Rioja done right.",Seleccion Personal,91,55,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Abel Mendoza
135655,Spain,"A complete modern Rioja with cola, cassis and smoky aromas. Excellent mouthfeel and toasty black fruit and licorice flavors work well together, and the finish is refined, warm and peppery. Not an overly lush wine but it is generous and loaded with a bit of everything good: body, tannin, acidity, flavor and complexity. Drink now through 2014.",Reserva,91,27,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Muga
135666,Spain,"A bit sweet and raisiny on the nose, but also dense and powerful. The palate runs rough and tannic, but there's enough richness and extract to allow for that. Flavors of cassis and raspberry are dark but snappy, while the finish has raisiny notes but also some edge. This one may improve with time; drink now through 2013.",Miros,88,19,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Peñafiel
135680,Spain,"Starts out a bit sweaty and leathery, but soon it turns more smoky. As a whole it's more bulky and barnyardy than most PX wines, with sweet prune and raisin flavors that seem a bit generic. Thick on the finish, with a gooey sweetness throughout.",Extra Rich,88,30,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Pedro Ximénez,Pedro Romero
135688,Spain,"Dusty, creamy, powdered sugar aromas are nice and easygoing, while the palate has balance and a mouthfeel that caresses solid apple, citrus and peach flavors.

135709,Spain,"The best new release in the Eguren family's collection of modern Rioja wines is this small-production, 100% Tempranillo.

135714,Spain,"As expected, the wine exhibits a dense black color, with mineral, burnt toast and dark fruit on the bouquet.

135719,Spain,"The bouquet explodes with tobacco, leather, dry oak and waves of berry fruit. In the mouth, the wine sits comfortably on the tongue, with firm tannins offering structure to the bedazzling boysenberry, black cherry and cassis flavors. Long and intoxicating on the finish.

135750,Spain,"Meaty and composed, with an earthy nose that carries plenty of dark fruit and minty herbal accents. The palate shows clarity and density, but it's a touch gritty, hard and tannic.

135770,Spain,"Earthy black cherry aromas give this easygoing Rioja an honest and true nose. The palate is almost what you'd call flush, but on the other hand it's snappy and fresh, with commendable black cherry and plum flavors.

135811,Spain,"Aromas of olive, tobacco and dark plum are satisfactory and convincing. It tastes of black cherry and other berries wrapped into a short, stout package. Finishes simple.",Solaz,84,8,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Shiraz-Tempranillo,Osborne
135819,Spain,"Grapy and granular smelling, with heavy, raw aromas that lack finesse and agility but offer plenty of thump. Surprisingly, the palate on this dark, more modern-styled wine is kind of tart, with racy cherry and blackberry fruit. Not an easy wine to evaluate; you want more from it but it isn't that generous.",Reserva Selección,84,135,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Lealtanza
135820,Spain,"Typically dry and leathery, with only modest red-fruit aromas. It's light to medium in weight, with punchy acidity pushing clean but thin cherry and plum fruit. Not too big or spacious on the finish, but good in a mainstream, traditional sort of way.",Crianza,84,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Loriñon
135826,Spain,"Light in color; almost transparent. The nose is largely as the color suggests: light and leathery, with old-school character. Leafy red fruit dominates the palate, which is dry and controlled by crisp acidity, tannin and spice.",Reserva,84,32,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Finca El Encinal
135828,Spain,"Starts with lightly roasted aromas of herbal fruit and pepper, while the palate is deeper and more pure, with raspberry, cherry and cranberry flavors. Finishes medium in terms of power and length, but short on complexity. Good in a basic sense, with proper balance.",NA,84,9,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Palacio
135829,Spain,"Smells like slow-roasted fruit mixed with a dusting of savory spice. Not the freshest kid on the block, but it offers cherry and apple-skin flavors that are decent and smooth. Not a thriller but not bad.",NA,84,16,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Red Blend,Jarrero
135830,Spain,"Funky, with earthy, heavy aromas. Seems a bit rubbery and peppery, with cola, plum and olive flavors. Tannic, too. Not nearly as fruity, clean, ripe and pleasing as the 2001.",Prestigio,84,23,Northern Spain,Cigales,NA,Tinta Fina,Val de Los Frailes
135831,Spain,"Traditionally leathery, with earth and bramble on the bouquet. The cherry, raspberry and cola flavors on the palate are aggressive courtesy of sharp acidity, while some wayward oak-based butter and vanilla rises up late on the finish.

135837,Spain,"Salmon in color, with creamsicle aromas leading to cantaloupe and peach flavors. Runs juicy on the palate, with lean fruit, perky acids and a bitter-almond finish.

135838,Spain,"The chunky fruit aromas are like chewing gum, while the palate is punchy and drying, with tannic black cherry and cranberry flavors.

135845,Spain,"An obscure Catalonian wine made from indigenous grapes, this pricey oddball starts with bubblegum and candy aromas mixed with smoke and meat. The color is dark and the wine is a bit rough. But in a country, unusual way it redeems itself with zippy cherry flavors and a fresh, tight mouthfeel. Best with food.",Gaintus,87,49,Spain Other,Vino de Mesa,NA,Red Blend,Heretat Montrubí
135854,Spain,"Earth, leather and tomato are accents to the dry, lean bouquet. The wine is expectedly juicy and tight, with snappy raspberry and cherry flavors. It shows clean lines and an unbreakable personality; elegant, juicy and firm. Drink now–2009.",Faustino V Reserva,87,22,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Faustino
135869,Spain,"Dusty and still fairly fresh, but with that said this wine was certainly more in its prime six or eight months ago. Now it is slick but softening, with peach and citrus flavors doing their thing without much edge or kick.",Faustino V Rosado,86,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Faustino
135883,Spain,"Generic peach and melon aromas are pleasant, clean and simple, while flavors of pineapple, melon, mango and kumquat are basic and sweet, almost like canned fruit salad. Finishes pithy, with some banana-like sweetness.",Viña 27,84,10,Catalonia,Costers del Segre,NA,Chardonnay,Raimat
135885,Spain,"Wild, foxy and full of young, bursting berry fruit. There's nothing tamed or refined or special about this youthful Tempranillo. The flavors of plum and berries are intense, bright, grabby and modest in what they deliver. Consistent wine from year to year.",NA,84,6,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,Campos Reales
135896,Spain,"Starts with earthy burnt aromas, but in short time cassis and berry aromas rise to the surface. Fresh and tangy feeling, with spunky red fruit and tomato flavors. Finishes a little saucy, with more tomato and an herbal aftertaste.",NA,84,10,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo-Shiraz,Penascal
135902,Spain,"Smells like cherries and fruit punch. The palate is snappy and simple, with red fruit front and center. Shows a tiny bit of wood on the finish, but overall it's a tart, lean wine that grabs at the palate.",Oak Aged 6 Months,83,13,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Finca La Estacada
135909,Spain,"Brawny plum and blackberry aromas feature notes of bacon, rubber and leather, all of which lead you to expect big, ripe flavors. But the news is, those flavors aren't anywhere to be found. The profile is tangy and lean, with sharp berry notes. Quick and simple on the finish, with aggressive acidity and tannins.",NA,83,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Cosme Palacio y Hermanos
135913,Spain,"A wine searching for an identity. The nose deals menthol, licorice, grilled meat and molasses but little-to-no bright fruit. That heaviness transfers to the mouth, where marinated, baked flavors mix with green tomato. Fails to impress.",NA,83,36,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,Montecastro
135918,Spain,"Functional and fruity, with big aromas of plum and berry on the slightly foxy nose. Fully tannic across the palate, so it feels kind of hard. The big berry flavors are loud and basic.",NA,83,7,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Merlot,Infinitus
135922,Spain,Light raspberry and strawberry aromas lead into snappy berry flavors. The feel is almost astringent; call it tangy and tight. Juicy but also rubbery. Shows both positives and negatives.,NA,83,10,Central Spain,Castilla La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,Día Naciente
135924,Spain,"Far more lean, raw and rough than ideal, with a touch of burnt field on the nose. The palate keeps that raw, reedy taste, which is smoothed out by softening oak notes. Better on the finish than up front.",Abadia Mediterrània,83,30,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Costers del Priorat
135926,Spain,"It has been a few years since 2001 was a current vintage, and while Montsant wines can age, this one doesn't seem to be going anywhere in particular. The nose is overdone with heavy mint, menthol and cinnamon-driven oak, while the palate is jumpy and tannic. Not a cheap wine, but also not that great.",Clos D'Englora,83,40,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Red Blend,Cellers Baronia del Montsant
135927,Spain,"Earthy fruit aromas, blackberry and cola flavors and a soft, saturated finish all add up to a flush wine typical of La Mancha, where elegance is fleeting. And while this fruit-filled middleweight isn't off, it's not that alluring either.",Crianza,83,13,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Viña Jaraba
135928,Spain,"This wine is Cáceres' attempt at a modern (yet for the masses) Rioja, and frankly it's not working. The bouquet is nothing but an avalanche of coconut and butter, which stems from the barrel regimen the wine goes through. And the palate is loud, chunky and clumsy. Yes, there's big fruit and bulk; but it's grabby, oversized and overoaked.",MC,83,38,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marqués de Cáceres
135929,Spain,"After a couple of vintages of really raving about this Merlot, the '02, from a cool, wet vintage, just isn't that great. The nose is dominated by rhubarb and sharpness, while the palate offers peppery flavors and a rough feel. Plenty of olive on the finish brings ripeness into question.",Deyo,82,18,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Merlot,Castillo de Monjardin
135930,Spain,"Somontano is not exactly prime real estate among Spanish wine regions, but Blecua, a four-grape blend led by Cabernet Sauvignon, is one of the best wines the region has to offer. Smoke, licorice, rooty cola and lemony oak aromas mix with flavors of blackberry, coffee, cola and roasted meats. It's a bit choppy and hard now, but time will help it along. A classy wine to drink from 2011 through 2016.",Blecua,91,100,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Red Blend,Viñas del Vero
135936,Spain,"A rewarding wine that isn't overly pricey or difficult to enjoy. Dark, lightly baked aromas hint at raisin and marshmallow, while the palate has a deep texture and vital acidity. Savory, tea-infused flavors bring pulse and kick, and as a whole it delivers a true reflection of what Ribera del Duero should be.",Damana Crianza,91,21,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas y Viñedos Tábula
135938,Spain,"Earth, rubber, spice, oak and bold berry aromas give this a classic Ribera nose, while the palate is pure and sensual, with shining raspberry, strawberry and plum flavors. Control and poise are on display, and the finish is clean, dry, warm and satisfying. Will be better in two or three years; best from 2012 through 2018.",Malleolus,91,71,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto Fino,Emilio Moro
135970,Spain,"Dense and spicy on the nose, with tobacco, baked fruit aromas and dry, woody notes. It's a fairly rich, slick and generous Rioja with lightly baked berry fruit flavors, spice cake accents and limited complexity. Solid on the finish, with additional spice notes. Drink now through 2013.",Finca Monasterio,88,45,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Baron De Ley
135974,Spain,"A touch gritty and baked on the nose, and that ripe character persists throughout this semimodern Ribera wine. Along the route there's raisiny notes, baked plum flavors and oak-driven vanilla and spice. On the finish, vanilla is the lasting flavor. Solid and oaky, with some pushy coconut.",Reserva,88,24,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Valdubón
135975,Spain,"Clean and vibrant, with citrus blossom and apple aromas. The palate is a bit neutral in flavor but shows good cut and a cleansing feel along with tastes of spiced apple and white nectarine. Finishes clean and pure. Drink now.",NA,88,15,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Viña Bade
135993,Spain,"Classic in color, and backed by aromatics of lavender, graphite and pure blackberry. This is not overly weighty, as the acidity keeps it pointed and pure. There's a lot of elegance and balance to this wine; a perfect example of how to blend multiple vineyards into one excellent whole.",Pagos Viejos,95,95,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Artadi
135994,Spain,"Masculine and heady stuff, as leather, espresso, smoked meat, mocha and intense blackberry aromas set the stage for an intense, driven, structured palate that's full of coconut, vanilla bean, cocoa and pure plum and berry. A serious nuevo classico Rioja if there ever was one.",Altos de Lanzaga,95,105,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Telmo Rodríguez
135995,Spain,"What a superb combination of new oak, leather, mineral, mocha and berry fruit this wine delivers. It's a giant, with a ripped palate of upfront boysenberry and then coffee and vanilla in support. All the power, precision and other attributes of modern Rioja are on display. Best in a few more years.",Finca El Bosque,95,145,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
135996,Spain,"Full and ready, this fabulous wine from Rioja Alavesa sets the bar very high for any of its Vanguardia co-runners. Gloria hits hard with bacon, tire rubber, tobacco and pastry crust aromas, but also pure dark fruit. Then it's wave after wave of boysenberry and crisped brown sugar flavors prior to a finale of heady European chocolate. Need we say more? 750 cases produced; best now through 2011.",Gloria de Ostatu,95,75,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Ostatu
136002,Spain,"Plant-by-plant fruit selection leads to intensity, concentration and structure. Aro shows gripping tannins and juicy acidity, and overall it reeks of power and precision.

136010,Spain,"Only a select portion of a prized 30-year-old vineyard gives fruit to the wine named after the Eguren brothers' great grandfather.

136012,Spain,"One half of the wine is lush and opulent, the other juicy, fresh and pulsing with the essence of old-vines Rioja fruit. So for every note of molasses, burnt toast, chocolate or baked berry pie, there's a twinge of acidity, a spike of tannin and a dollop of earthy terroir. Tempranillo with 15% Graciano. 500 cases made.

136015,Spain,"Slightly tighter and more complex than previous years, this single-  vineyard wine delivers a ton of spice and herbs on a masculine bouquet and palate.

136017,Spain,"This is yet another magnetic example from the Eguren stable that includes El Puntido, San Vicente, Finca El Bosque and the many Sierra Cantabria wines. It's a racy, red-fruit dominated Tempranillo with raspberry, plum and cassis flavors accented by firm, almost blazing acidity. It's definitely tighter and more compact than the more generous, richer 2005 La Nieta. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",La Nieta,93,145,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Viñedos de Paganos
136064,Spain,"Round, mossy and deep smelling, but austere in the mouth. A berry and plum flavor profile is infused with tomato and herbal notes, while the finish is long, healthy and cleansing. Very sturdy and Navarran in every sense because it blends juicy fruit with cool-climate typicity. Good but not for fans of sweet, bulky, superripe reds.",Crianza,87,17,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Finca Albret
136070,Spain,"Pleasant but a little light on the nose, with candied fruit notes. Flavors of green melon, apple and citrus are standard fare and clean, while the feel is fresh and peachy. A balanced and nice wine, but not overly exciting or precise. Drink now with salad or fish.",NA,87,18,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,As Laxas
136110,Spain,"Although this wine has been favorably reviewed in the past, this vintage seems jammy and ponderous. The color is blinding and the bouquet reduced and jammy. The palate pours on monotonous boysenberry and blackberry, while the finish is granular. A specialty wine (only 250 cases made) that proves why Graciano is rarely made by itself.",Single Vineyard,84,95,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Graciano,Contino
136112,Spain,"Chunky but also lively, with pungent, aggressive Sauvignon aromas of prickly fruit, grapefruit and greens. The palate is heavy and all about pink grapefruit, while the texture is thick. Has its good points; and it's varietally correct.",NA,84,7,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Sauvignon Blanc,Penascal
136115,Spain,"Mildly green and brambly, with touches of tomato and raspberry on the full, sun-baked bouquet. Yet in the mouth it's tart, pushing red cherry flavors onto a palate that's lactic and creamy. Settles late to show some fruit and subtleties.",Tinto Barrica,83,7,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Red Blend,Don Ramón
136118,Spain,"Tomato and rhubarb are present on the earthy nose, which isn't very fruity but does set the stage for solid raspberry and cherry flavors. Medium to light in weight, with a slight barnyardy, herbal quality to the finish.",Oak Aged 6 Months,83,13,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Finca La Estacada
136124,Spain,"Dark, with a heavy warmth to the nose and lots of earth and toast. Comes on more racy in the mouth, with snappy red-cherry and roasted plum flavors. Gets harder and harder as it opens, displaying heat and tannin. Needs better balance and cushion.",Crianza,83,28,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,Matarromera
136126,Spain,"Cherry and baked fruit carries the nose, followed by more cherry and some oaky vanilla. Plump but flat in terms of feel, with stewy finishing notes. Never finds much of a groove.",Alta Gama Reserva,83,42,Northern Spain,Cigales,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Rufina
136127,Spain,"Quite a bit different than the bodega's Flor de Grealo prestige bottling; this wine is a touch stewy, with molasses and braised-beef aromas. The palate leans toward unctuous and syrupy, while the finish is flatter than ideal. A blend of Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon.",Petit Grealo,83,16,Catalonia,Costers del Segre,NA,Red Blend,Vinya L'Hereu
136129,Spain,"See-through in color, with leafy, earthy aromas that turn more oaky with time. Almost citric in flavor, with tart, lean raspberry and strawberry flavors. Clean but missing potency; juicy nearly to the point of sour.",NA,83,8,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Casa de la Reina
136133,Spain,"Hard apple and lemony aromas lead to a stiff palate defined by tart green apple, underripe pineapple and green herbs. More acidic than desirable, with a clean finish.",Solaz Blanco,83,8,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Viura,Osborne
136156,Spain,"A lean and peppery style of Rioja that's very much from the old school. Red fruits such as raspberry and pie cherries steal the palate, giving the wine a tangy sensation and a spicy, almost sharp feel and finish. Very young and fresh right now; it improves with patient airing.",Crianza,86,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Salceda
136159,Spain,This Macabeo (Viura) blend is neutral on the nose but fairly big and bulky on the palate. Flavors of lemon-lime and banana are spritzy at first and then stickier late. The rest of the composition (Macabeo and Parellada) dictates that the flavors will be short; but what's on display is nice and creamy.,Proyecto Cu4tro Blanco,86,10,Catalonia,Catalunya,NA,White Blend,Bodegas Concavins
136163,Spain,"A powerful berry-based wine with no oak is what's on offer. The nose exudes rubber and leather at first, and then comes a wave of rambunctious black fruit. The palate is bright and packed, with ripe plum and cherry flavors. Shows good mouthfeel and chewy tannins. And once again: no oak!",NA,86,10,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Condado de Oriza
136164,Spain,"Persistently murky and leafy on the nose, this traditional-style Rioja brings juicier, brighter fruit to the palate along with some tangy, somewhat sharp acids. In the folds, a dash of oak brings vanilla and additional tannin into the picture. Improves with airing.",Crianza,86,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Loriñon
136170,Spain,"Aromas of milk chocolate, cotton candy, bacon and sweet fruits are a lead into standard fare cherry and raspberry flavors. The feel is acidic but fresh, while the finish is thin but clean. Average wine.",Roble,84,16,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Vilano
136172,Spain,"Opens with black cherry, baked plum and other heavy, semiroasted aromas. The palate is chunky but weak on definition and structure, while the flavors are limited to dry red-apple skins and bland red fruit. Acidic as well, which leads to a washed-out finish.",Dama de Toro Crianza,84,15,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Fariña
136175,Spain,"Pure and driving, but also acidic and woody in aromas and flavors. Can't say that this barrel fermented Viura-based white is Muga's best wine. It's crisp with green apple and pineapple, but also a little sour and simple. With 10% Malvasia.",Barrel Fermented,84,16,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Viura,Muga
136180,Spain,"Vanilla and a lot of oak blend with baked apple on the nose, while the palate is grabby and resiny, with drawn, oak-heavy flavors of baked apple and vanilla. For a winery that rarely misses with its red wines, this is one that's o.k. but probably not worth the money.",Organza,84,28,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Sierra Cantabria
136185,Spain,"Opens with generic berry aromas and a slight candied, gaseous undercurrent. The palate is modest and lean, with decent raspberry flavors and not a whole lot of follow through. Basic and a bit rubbery.",Tinto,84,14,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Vilano
136188,Spain,"Begins with a sweet marshmallow creaminess on the nose, which is followed by a firm, tanninc palate with snappy cherry and raspberry flavors. Clean and easy to understand, but in the end it's a very regular wine.",Tinto,84,13,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Pago del Vostal
136197,Spain,"Briar and rhubarb aromas suggest stemminess, but the palate is fairly clean and clear, with tight, rubbery tannins supporting red fruit flavors of cherry and plum. Short, rubbery and unexceptional, but good enough despite a whiff of green that's probably due to the Cabernet in the wine.",Rojo,84,9,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Basico
136206,Spain,"Bold in color, with a stewy nose that oozes raisin and licorice. The palate is heavy, with bacon and reduced berry flavors. Flat and a touch burnt late, and in general it's in dire need of an infusion of acidity.",NA,82,12,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Syrah,Corona de Aragón
136211,Spain,"The bouquet mixes bramble and berry notes, which turn rougher and more vegetal as time passes. The palate is peppery and light, with just adequate cherry and berry flavors. A light, distant wine with some similarities to Beaujolais Nouveau.",NA,82,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Darien
136214,Spain,"Soft aromatically, with notes of pear, vanilla and banana. Surprisingly, the palate is short and tart, with sharp citrus and pineapple flavors. Entirely basic and lacking punch. Already seems to be in decline and it's brand new.",Contrapunto,82,13,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Agro de Bazán
136217,Spain,"Light melon and vanilla aromas are simple yet muddled, while the green melon and lemon flavors are not overly generous but acceptable. A narrow wine with a lean figure and protruding acidity.",NA,82,10,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Solar de la Vega
136222,Spain,"Woodsy and smoky up front, which sort of hides the fact that there's very little fruit on the bones of this wine. On the palate, it's peppery and firm, with spiky tannins.",Crianza,82,10,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Pago de la Jaraba
136223,Spain,"Short and slightly chemical on the nose, with hard-to-define melon, citrus and apple flavors. A tart wine without too much going on.",Veliterra Joven,81,9,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,White Blend,Agricola Castellana
136225,Spain,"Light reddish in color, with dry cranberry aromas and a strong hint of spearmint. Surprisingly heavy in the mouth, with slightly cooked flavors and a wave of burnt brown sugar on the finish. A wine with some issues.",Old Vines,81,10,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,La Riada
136226,Spain,"This Navarran winery usually does well, but its '02 Crianza isn't up to snuff. The nose is clumsy and jammy, while the fruit is underdeveloped and dull. Acceptable on its best day.",Crianza,81,10,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Viña Sardasol
136241,Spain,"Dark and crusty aromas of black fruit, wild black truffles, coconut and lemon peel are pure Priorato, while the tight, tannic palate provokes salivation as it delivers firm black cherry, dark plum and citrusy (lemon) flavors. Finishes with coffee and coconut. The definition of a harmonious Priorat red. Drink from 2011 through 2016.",Mas Sinén Negre,91,62,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Celler Burgos-Porta
136242,Spain,"Impressive for the way it blends modern richness with authentic aromas and flavors. The nose offers prune, leather, blackberry and fine dried cheese, while the palate is savory and smooth, with chocolaty, round berry fruit flavors and then additional chocolate and toast on the finish. Lively and dense, but not heavy. Drink now through 2013.",NA,91,30,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Comenge
136264,Spain,"An oaky, modern-style wine with a staunch mocha and vanilla influence, but the fruit is ripe and rich enough to handle it. Spicy and grainy on the nose, with vanilla and resin seeping through. The palate remains woody but is full of berry flavors, while the omnipresent barrel influence carries onto the rich, ripe finish.",Crianza,88,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,El Coto
136290,Spain,"A very pretty middle-aged wine that has at least another decade in it. At this point in time, the nose is still showing a lot of black-fruit aromas, while the palate is chewy, meaty and rich as it spreads out with ripe flavors mixed with touches of mushroom, truffle and vanilla. A fine Gran Reserva with equal bits of tradition and modernity showing through.",Gran Reserva,93,35,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
136300,Spain,"Beautiful in color as it blends hues of purple and red. The nose is endowed with leather, herbs and cherry, while the full palate houses a delicious range of fruit and wood flavors along with fine tannins and length.

Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Gran Reserva,93,37,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
136306,Spain,"Char and chocolate, then a dollop of rum raisin and black cherry, and there is your nose. This version of Cirsion, one of our very favorite modern Riojas, is relatively soft, raisiny and simple, and for that it doesn't quite rate with some of the past vintages, which were spectacular. But that doesn't mean you won't love the wine's smooth texture, cocoa and baked berry flavors, and its overall generous character. Drink now through 2010.",Cirsion,92,273,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Roda
136308,Spain,"Right away this shows the requisite signs of excellence. The meaty, earthy, leathery, full-fruit nose is just right, and the palate is elevated in how it is infused with pure blackberry and plum as well as chocolate and fine herbs. Finishes with class and kick. Best from 2008–2011.",Altos de Lanzaga,92,82,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Telmo Rodríguez
136309,Spain,"Like all young Sierra Cantabria wines made from old vines, this has a purple color that's supported by aromas of coffee, mocha and black fruits. It's half aged in American oak (the other half is French), and it's much more tannic, acidic and structured than the fleshy 2003. A wine with pure flavors and a dynamic structure. Just under 1,000 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Colección Privada,92,48,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
136314,Spain,"Benjamin Romeo makes nothing but big, idiosyncratic wines. And some are big hits while others may not be your thing. This modern, round, polished blend is creamy and smooth but also loaded with almond, pear, citrus and toast flavors. Certainly there's a strong wood element, but it handles it with aplomb and oozes class. Drink as soon as possible. It won't age much past 2007. Only 25 cases made.",Qué Bonito Cacareaba,92,74,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Benjamin Romeo
136318,Spain,"Robust and sexy, with smoke, leather and pure berry and plum aromas that make for a sensational bouquet. The palate is up to the precedent set by the nose, as the cherry and cola flavors are outright lovely. For what you get, this is almost a value. It shows us what that Muga can do in a great vintage.",Selección Especial Reserva,92,37,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Muga
136319,Spain,"Stylish and serious, with polished, fancy oak sitting like royalty atop dark   fruit that is almost pruney. The palate hits with a solid smack of blackberry, while a secondary layer delivers chocolate, mocha and spice. Not quite at the level of the classic 2001 but still excellent.",El Puntido,92,54,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Viñedos de Paganos
136361,Spain,"Berry, earth and a touch of citrus peel make for a good bouquet, while the palate shows structure and lots of verve. The flavor profile of plum, cherry and roasted berry is solid and complete, while the finish is fresh, clean and reaches a proper finale. Call it a well-made but familiar type of old-vines Garnacha.",Tinta,87,16,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra Ribera del Jiloca,NA,Garnacha,Vega del Jiloca
136363,Spain,"Clean, fresh and layered up front, with peach, cherry and nectarine flavors and then apricot on the finish. The feel is good throughout, with no excess weight or sweetness. An uncomplicated, no-frills rosé, which is what Navarra and Señoría de Sarria do best.",Rosado,87,10,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Grenache,Señorío de Sarria
136366,Spain,"Interesting blanco from the inland Galician region of Ribeira Sacra. It's Albariño with 15% Godello, and it's ready to drink now. Aromas of pulpy peach and pineapple are nice, while the apple and lime flavors are fairly gentle and flush. Finishes with adequate freshness for an '07, making it a no-qualms type of white wine.",NA,87,16,Galicia,Ribeira Sacra,NA,Albariño,Abadía da Cova
136412,Spain,"Light red to brick in color. Starts out spicy and leathery with more rhubarb and bramble than, say, black fruit. Tastes largely of raspberry and strawberry before finishing with caramel and a touch of toast. Simple.",Primum Vitae Crianza,83,19,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Vallformosa
136413,Spain,"Savory and spicy, with a lot of tree bark, licorice and dry red fruit. Quite hard and rocky on the tongue, with jagged tannins and raw acidity.",Crianza,83,19,Northern Spain,Cigales,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Concejo
136414,Spain,"Quite rooty and earthy, with brandied cherry aromas. Not too pure and fruity, as green bean and carob creep onto the palate. Finishes a touch dry and tannic. Seems caught in Neverland.",Gran Reserva,83,25,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Red Blend,LAN
136416,Spain,"Olive, roast plum and heavy berry aromas lead toward modest boysenberry flavors that show some weediness. The finish is tannic and hard, with a touch of red fruit as well as a burnt characteristic.",Solaz,83,8,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Osborne
136420,Spain,"Quite brambly, with a persistent burnt character that sticks with it from start to finish. Along the way there's cooked cherry and raspberry flavors supported by strong oak notes. Fails to improve in the glass; in fact it's just the opposite, as it falls apart.",Crianza,83,18,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Solar de Randez
136421,Spain,"Mild butterscotch aromas blend with sweeter fruit-cocktail notes, while the flavors run tangy and short, with an emphasis on lemon and green apple. Dry and lean late, with ample snap and freshness. Simple.",Blanco,83,11,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Viura,El Coto
136422,Spain,"Rubbery yet light-bodied, with distant berry and burnt-wood aromas. Seems dilute and more acidic than ideal, with crisp fruit flavors that run tart and zippy. More of a wake-you-up wine than something rich and plump.",Roble,83,10,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Finca El Encinal
136428,Spain,"Losing color and steam; the nose already is showing sherry, root beer and other oxidized notes of tobacco and caramel. Tastes of rooty fruit, earth and some citrus peel. Has seen better days.",Reserva,83,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marques de Arienzo
136431,Spain,"Piercing wood intersects with cherry aromas in front of a lean, scrappy palate that features short raspberry and cherry flavors. Quite tangy, zesty stuff with no off flavors but nothing to write home about, either.",Oak Aged 12 months,82,16,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Finca La Estacada
136434,Spain,"Pickled aromas are obvious on the chunky, warm bouquet, and never does the wine shed its green personality.

136437,Spain,"Saucy, with overt oak aromas that manifest themselves as espresso and charred beef. Fairly acidic and thin across the palate, where pie cherry is the dominant flavor and sourness mars the finish.",Reserva,82,68,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Altanza
136443,Spain,"Solid as can be, with sweet-styled aromas of berry syrup and tire rubber. In the mouth, the wine shows juicy cherry and raspberry flavors in front of a lively finish. Throughout it shows good form and a bit more roughness than the Volteo varietal Tempranillo or the line's Tempranillo-Shiraz blend.",NA,86,8,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Volteo
136449,Spain,"It's hard to rate an aging, oxidizing, barrel-fermented Verdejo and take into consideration the wine's faded qualities versus its complexities. If you like dried apricots, dehydrated mango slices and fruit jellies, then this will tickle your fancy. Adherents to the school that believes whites should be fresh and palate cleansing should take a pass.",Fuente Elvira - Fermentado en Barrica,86,22,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Pedro Escudero
136456,Spain,"This tiny production SB is sweet and easygoing, with canned peach aromas along with pineapple and mild citrus flavors. Roundness and a smooth feel work in the wine's favor, because there's just enough acidity to push the length on the finish. Drink right away.",Doña Beatriz,86,12,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Sauvignon,Bodegas Cerrosol
136457,Spain,"Smooth and friendly on the nose, with easy melon and peach aromas that give you confidence in the wine's core character. The palate is nothing special; there's citrus and pineapple before a medium-long finish. Solid but not the most expressive Albariño out there.",Selección,86,25,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Adegas D'Altamira
136461,Spain,"Starts out sharp and funky, and then quickly you realize that it's showing signs of age. The wine blends sweet and sour notes on both the bouquet and palate, issuing primary grapefruit flavors and some mustard greens on the finish. But the feel is chunky and it's losing its zest day by the day.",NA,86,15,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Vega de la Reina
136476,Spain,"Opens with decent dusty apple and peach aromas, but they don't really hold together for long. And the palate is similar in that it offers adequate opening flavors of green apple and citrus but no improvement after that. Drink right away; it won't age well.",Blanco,84,9,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Sauvignon Blanc,Basico
136477,Spain,"More soft and milky than exact or pungent, with bitterness intermixed with apple on the palate. Feels a little soft and bland for such a young Rueda white. Perfectly drinkable but uninspired.",NA,84,10,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Analivia
136486,Spain,"Pithy, heavy and chunky, with waxy fruit mixed with oak. The wine has a pretty good mouthfeel and balance, but it just doesn't do much in terms of aromatics or in the flavor category. Decent for a barrel fermented Viura but nothing to write home about.",Barrel Fermented White,84,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Marqués de Cáceres
136489,Spain,"Raisiny and baked on the nose, with a syrupy consistency to the palate. Along the way there's stewed fruit, baked blackberry pie notes and overt sweetness. Candied, ultrarich and tilting toward molasses on the finish.",Gravedad,83,13,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Casto Pequeño
136494,Spain,"Not a lot to latch onto here. The aromas are sharp and sweaty, while the palate feel is more dull than it should be, while flavors of melon and pickled fruits are briney.",NA,83,10,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Sauvignon Blanc,Analivia
136500,Spain,"Brambly red fruit, leather and a strong whiff of dill pickle create a less than welcoming nose, which is backed by tart red fruit that carries a roasted overtone. Oaky and tomatoey throughout, with a lean mouthfeel.",Conde de Valdemar Crianza,81,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Valdemar
136501,Spain,"Lean and peppery, with more citrus than berry on the nose. The mouth is a bit grabby, with a starchy feel and far-reaching tannins. Clearly not a great wine but it holds itself together.",3 Months in Oak,81,6,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Casa Solar
136505,Spain,"Hard and jumbled up front, with slightly harsh peppery notes interlocking with light raspberry fruit. A light, airy, almost innocuous wine with mild bitterness on the finish. Doesn't impress.",NA,81,8,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Rioja Vega
136506,Spain,"A blend of Cabernet, Merlot and Grenache that can only be described as strange. The nose is stewy, the palate full of root beer, baked berries and syrup. It's even cloying on the finish. Yet through all that there's still a little something redeeming about it.",NA,81,20,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra Ribera del Gállego-Cinco Villas,NA,Red Blend,Reino de los Mallos
136509,Spain,"Reddish in color and plump on the nose. The palate, however, deals only light cherry and dilute berry flavors. Inconsequential on the finish, with little character overall.",Rosado,81,10,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Vilano
136510,Spain,"Jammy and sweet on the nose, like a jar of strawberry preserves. The palate, however, is light and tart, with burnt berry flavors. Finishes peppery and short, with little to latch onto.",NA,80,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Cueto
136511,Spain,"Medicinal and chalky on the nose; tart and lively, with acidic cherry and plum flavors. Short on the finish.",NA,80,9,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Mar de Castilla
136518,Spain,"Almost volatile with its cooked rhubarb and berry aromas. Screechy black cherry and raspberry flavors don't really help it along. Simply a hard, closed-down wine that isn't up to its price tag.",Vertus Reserva,80,35,Levante,Utiel-Requena,NA,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Bodegas Iranzo
136530,Spain,"Deep and dark on the nose, with licorice, cola and prune aromas. The palate is chunky and full, albeit a touch soft. Saturated flavors of cola, blackberry and chocolate define it as a rich, modern wine, and the finish is appropriately creamy and stacked with sweetness and depth. A lush blend of Garnacha, Cabernet and two indigenous varieties. Drink now through 2011.",Negre,90,20,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Red Blend,Jaspi
136532,Spain,"Opens with earth, tobacco, briar and nutty aromas. This is now aged to its best state, and while there's still some tannic bite, it's at a straightforward, mature place. Flavors of roasted plum and spice are classy, and the finish is reflective of a fine vintage. Drink now or in the near future.",Glorioso Gran Reserva,90,35,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Palacio
136553,Spain,"Dark and dense, with aromas of rich black fruits, grilled meat and a lot of oak. The palate is extracted but it's not the least bit hard or biting. Flavors of Concord grapes and blackberry are sweet, and the finish keeps its fruit. Could it use more minerality and toughness? Maybe, but as is it's very approachable. Drink now through 2012.",Selecció Especial,90,95,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Ferrer Bobet
136582,Spain,"Sweet smelling, with a touch of pastry. Focused, lean and nice in the mouth, showing dry apple and citrus peel flavors. Solid Cava that brings a modicum of leesy, pithy richness on the finish.",Brut Reserva,87,18,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Sabartés
136583,Spain,"Jumps out of the chute with baked, earthy, funky aromas that are more savory and spicy than outright fruity. The palate has a good but limited mouthfeel, while the flavors of raspberry are spicy and saucy. Good in a subtle, earthy, nonfruity way.",Crianza Vendimia Seleccionada Finca Valdelayegua,87,19,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Prado Rey
136584,Spain,"Dark purple in color, with a jammy nose of berry fruit and coconut. The palate is concentrated, a little narrow and sharp in the center, with snappy, pointed cherry and berry flavors. Fruity but sheer wine, with dashes of nutmeg and cocoa powder on the finish.",Elite Vendimia Seleccionada,87,29,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinta Fina,Prado Rey
136587,Spain,"Comes across a bit baked, syrupy and sweet on the nose, with a hint of stalkiness and stem. The palate has a lush early feel, but further inspection unveils a hollow core. Flavors veer toward earthy raspberry, while the finish is chunky and properly reflects what came before it.",Reserva,87,40,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Vilano
136616,Spain,"It has taken this bodega a few years to get it right, but in 2004 this blend of 80% Tempranillo and 20% Cabernet is dark and rocking. The nose offers that modern but increasingly familiar blast of bacon, baked fruit pastry and leather, and the palate works its magic with black plum and smoked game flavors. If it were just a touch longer and richer toward the finish it might rank as a nuevo classico.",Finca Monasterio,91,42,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Baron De Ley
136666,Spain,"Cuatro implies four grapes blended together, and the nose on this Tempranillo/Cab/Merlot/Syrah mix is a bit leathery and tight. In the mouth, it's linear and borderline lean, with plum and bramble flavors backstopped by tomato and herb notes. Juicy, intense and solid, but not overly generous or evolved. Typical Somontano red wine.",Cuatro,87,40,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Red Blend,Olvena

136722,Spain,"Smells fairly solid, with plum, prune and leather. But the palate is ultrasweet and milky, with a strong candied essence that doesn't impress unless your thing is chocolate-covered cherries and vanilla. Way too expensive for what's in the bottle.",Fagus,82,37,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Coto de Hayas
136723,Spain,"Heavy and green, with nutty, leathery aromas. Rather candied and less than fresh in the mouth, with a weedy underbelly on the palate. Finishes herbal, minty and burnt, but with a lot of size and power.",Vega del Rio - Crianza,82,14,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Navajas
136728,Spain,"There's a lot of raw power on this jumbled red that starts with rubber and spice before settling on maple. The mouth is a cacaphony of loud flavors, while the finish is stark. Needs finesse to match the aggressiveness.",NA,82,60,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,Rento
136733,Spain,"Stewy, with red cabbage and field funk on the nose. Limited in scope, with tart plum flavors along with a persistent infusion of green. Acceptable mouthfeel and balance are what save it from a worse fate.",Joven,81,7,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo,Mar de León
136734,Spain,"A raisiny wine of the first order. The nose is stewed, while the pruny palate is soft and chocolaty, mostly because there's no detectable acidity. Only late in the game do you catch some tannin and zest.",NA,81,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Garnacha,Legado Muñoz
136735,Spain,"Overly soft and deep in color, with heavy caramel and red licorice aromas. With no edges and little acidity, the wine seems flat. In addition, it finishes with bitterness as well as sugary sweetness. Imported by Quality Wines of Spain.",Rosé Joven,81,9,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Grenache,Marqués de Reala
136736,Spain,"Damp and foresty, and seeming old before its time. Raisiny fruit with clove and anise accents are acceptable but heavy. Tannic and bulky.",4 Meses Barrica,81,13,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,Riberal
136753,Spain,"A little baked and flat smelling, with licorice and stewed fruit aromas. Sounds kind of dark and heavy, right? But the palate runs to the thin side, with lean but pure raspberry and cherry flavors. Vitality and snap are its virtues; not much depth or character are its fallbacks.",Reserva,86,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marques de Arienzo
136755,Spain,"Magenta-tinted and ready to go; that in a nutshell is this easy, no-oak blend of Tempranillo and Grenache. It's fruity to the max, with aromas of boysenberry and black cherry as well as similar flavors. Ripe and easy to drink.",NA,85,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,El Circulo
136757,Spain,"Dusty and neutral on the nose, with a hint of wild flower and mineral to stir interest. The palate is dry despite having some size and plumpness; flavors of apple, peach and papaya are crisp and lean.",Estate Bottled Dry,85,13,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Muscat,Sumarroca
136760,Spain,"The winery has dialed back the time in oak for its barrel-fermented Viura to two months from five or six, and it's a decidedly less oaky wine than in years prior. Now it shows a controlled lees character along with lemon and apple flavors. Limited in what it offers, but made well.",Blanco Fermentado en Barrica,85,8,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Marqués de Cáceres
136766,Spain,"Oily and pungent, as if the cat were not let out of the house. But airing reveals a wide spectrum of green, yellow and orange fruits and vegetables. There's passion fruit, green pastures and some citrus in this varietally typical Rueda SB.",Montesol,85,19,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Sauvignon Blanc,Vinos Sanz
136774,Spain,"Years ago Rívola was one of Spain's standout value wines; but over time it has devolved. This version is mulchy and muddled, with heavy roasted fruit and red pepper aromas. The palate is grabby, rubbery and roasted, and raisiny notes work their way onto the flavor profile and finish.",Rívola,83,17,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Red Blend,Abadia Retuerta
136777,Spain,"Creamy and confected on the nose, which is proof of the “roble” designation. The palate is rather narrow and acidic, with semi-sour flavors of berry and cherry. Cleansing and tart; decent but doesn't go beyond that.",Roble,83,15,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Pago del Vostal
136780,Spain,"Smells like bath soap, then turns grassy and burnt. Tannic and medicinal in the mouth, although better as it airs out. Tastes and feels overdone and super sweet.",El Chaparral de Vega Sindoa Old Vines,83,14,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Garnacha,Vega Sindoa
136781,Spain,"Decent mass-produced Ribera del Duero. Strawberry and raspberry aromas lean you in the red fruit direction, and the palate is scouring, acidic and full of cherry fruit. Fresh on the finish and hard, but at least it doesn't have off flavors.",NA,83,9,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Viña del Val
136782,Spain,"Austere, green aromas are about as much as one can pull from the nose, while the palate is fresh and acidic, but lean. Flavors of lime, citrus and pith are zesty at first but pithy later on. Dull and strained, but not bad for Chardonnay from central Spain.",NA,83,8,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Chardonnay,Coto de Hayas
136789,Spain,"Young wild berry, cherry, rubber and cheese aromas lead to a big, rubbery, loud palate of plum and raspberry. Herbal notes, moderate sweetness and simplicity wrap it up.",Selección,83,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Spanish Vines
136795,Spain,"Too sour, strained and vegetal to rally behind. The nose is grassy and green, while the palate tastes of sour apple, gooseberry and lemon. Turns citric, mustardy and a little like asparagus on the finish.",El Cerezo Unoaked,82,12,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Chardonnay,Castillo de Monjardin
136835,Spain,"The label says it: fermented in barrel. And one sniff delivers the buttery, toasted character of a Burgundy or California Chardonnay. Underneath the oak, there's fine acidity and blazing apple fruit, and once it finishes you get a finely baked aftertaste. An interesting, elevated mix of Treixadura, Godello, Loureira and Albariño.",Fermentado en Barrica,90,20,Galicia,Ribeiro,NA,White Blend,Viña Mein
136852,Spain,"The opening of peach, mineral, honey and wild green herbs is alluring, and the palate runs smooth and full, and also a little soft and mature. Banana, papaya and melon flavors are pretty and the finish holds its stature. Not as minerally and tight as some; this wine has sweetness and depth. Drink soon.",NA,90,18,Northern Spain,Valdeorras,NA,Godello,Gaba do Xil
136859,Spain,"A treasure at this price. The nose is impeccably clean, with tropical fruit and honeyed melon aromas. Elegant in the mouth yet there's also just the right acidic pop to liven up the melon, kiwi and apple flavors. A pure, fruity ride. Treixadura, Torrontées, Loureira and Albariño comprise the blend.",NA,90,14,Galicia,Ribeiro,NA,White Blend,Viña Costeira
136873,Spain,"Coconut and vanilla aromas ride front and center on the oaky nose, although berry fruit rises up with time. The palate is bulky and saturated, almost what you'd call thick, while the flavors lean toward roasted berry, plum and woodspice. Vanilla and additional wood accents work the finish.",Reserva,87,23,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Condado de Oriza
136882,Spain,"Round and generally attractive, with raisiny richness that emerges with airing. The palate is more snappy and acidic than the nose might suggest, with herbal raspberry flavors. That same acidity lifts the finish, and overall the wine is fresh, racy and not that complex.",Reserva,87,25,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Prado Rey
136889,Spain,"From Viña Mayor, this French-oak-aged wine is composed and dry, with good plum and berry aromas that bring balanced oak as well. The palate sports proper weight and balance, solid berry and plum flavors, and a warm, minty finish. Not mind blowing but good for a weak vintage.",Secreto,87,20,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Mayor
136890,Spain,"With its spice and fig aromas, this registers as a rich, mature Rioja reserva. The palate runs toward sweet plums and blackberry, while the finish is mildly toasty and full, with coffee as the lasting flavor. This has many good qualities, not the least of which is balance and a touch of citrus peel. Best now–2010. 525 cases produced.",Cata de Consejero,91,58,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Consejo de la Alta
136891,Spain,"A sweet, ripe, jammy style for Roda I, with smooth tannins, corpulence and more than adequate minerality and power. This is not a flabby wine despite the heat of the vintage, and the lush cassis, blackberry and mocha notes come together on the back palate and finish.",Roda I,91,73,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Roda
136892,Spain,"Thick, brooding and aromatically mature, this delivers heft, grab and balance. It has developed black-fruit flavors followed by a cushioned, soft finish. Drink now and over the next several years as the 2001 gets better and the promising but not yet released 2004 begins to settle. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Reserva,91,77,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Remírez de Ganuza
136897,Spain,"You're going to like this masculine, well-oaked blend of 80% Tempranillo with 10% each Graciano and Garnacha. It's got modern touches but a lot of tradition as well. The wine is rich and round, with tobacco, coffee, chocolate and earth creating depth and character. With fine mouthfeel and a solid finish, you can drink now or hold a few more years.",Coto Real Reserva,91,46,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,El Coto
136901,Spain,"This seems eminently ageworthy; it has the strong foundation and pulsing acidity required of a true cellar dweller. The raspberry and plum fruit have a beam of acidity and the tannins are not shy. Shows all the hallmarks of a fine modern Rioja: power, purity and balance. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Torre Muga,91,90,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Muga
136907,Spain,"A dense wine from the start, and each subsequent whiff of the oaky but vital nose is convincing. The palate here is exemplary, especially for an '02; there's dark berry and plum flavors backed by notes of black licorice and pepper. An exceedingly nice wine with a textbook mix of tannins, flesh and acidity.",Reserva,91,28,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Ostatu
137010,Spain,"Oddly aromatized, with strong hints of hickory and sweets. The whole wine is a strange mix of clove and distant fruit. Finishes with weird notes of spiced tea and rubber. Made from 95% Garnacha. Imported by The Marchetti Co.",Rosado,81,7,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Grenache,Coto de Hayas
137021,Spain,"Heavy and waxy, and not all that likable. Weighs in as a dull, acidic white with a boring, sour disposition.",Blanco,80,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Viura,El Coto
137022,Spain,"Wheat and corn aromas announce the soft, oaky personality that this wine brings to the table. Grainy and heavily oaked, it sits on toast, vanilla and creamy, buttery flavors without offering any serious fruit or style.",Vega del Rio Crianza,80,14,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Viura,Bodegas Navajas
137041,Spain,"Interesting and unique blends get bonus points, but in the long run this conglomeration of indigenous grapes from Mallorca is a touch too resiny and bland to really deserve a call out. But for soft melon and pithy flavors, and the fact that it's made from the obscure Prensal and Muscat, we like it well enough.",Quíbia,85,15,Spanish Islands,Vi de la Terra Illes Balears,NA,White Blend,Ànima Negra
137044,Spain,"A warm vintage (2006) may be causing this wine to expire prematurely, but tasted in 2008 it seems to be losing its drive. The nose has wild flower and melon aromas, while the palate shows simple apricot, pineapple and mango flavors. The tropical notes are here, but the texture is watery and as a whole it doesn't go the extra yard.",NA,85,14,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Sauvignon Blanc,Blanco Nieva
137052,Spain,"Approach this simple Tempranillo with modest expectations and the jammy cherry aromas and flavors will strike you as pure and fresh. Complexity and style are not part of the equation, but an unoaked raspberry character, length and correct balance make it worthy.",NA,85,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Spanish Vines
137069,Spain,"Clean, wet, a bit sweet and rather formulaic, this Verdejo has a soft, chummy personality and seemingly more than a dash of residual sugar. Still, it manages to push tasty apple cider, papaya and other fuller-bodied, less acidic flavors.",NA,85,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Verdejo,Tapeña
137072,Spain,"Rusty colored and flat on the nose. Aromas of medicinal fruit and horse hide are less than stellar, and the soupy palate of weak raspberry and faux sweetness doesn't do much to improve things. Needs more vitality and overall quality.",NA,82,10,Central Spain,Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Altozano
137076,Spain,"Starts with nutty, oily, acrid aromas, and never is there much fruit character. The palate has bite but still seems short on acidity, and the flavors run toward funky citrus, asparagus and green beans. On the global scale of SB, this doesn't really cut it.",NA,82,10,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Sauvignon Blanc,Penascal
137087,Spain,"Generic fruit, hard rubber, olive and leather on the nose. Dry and tannic, with bitter black plum and a rock-hard finish. Tough and just not that much fun to drink.",Finca la Sabina,82,14,Central Spain,Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Sanchez Muliterno
137093,Spain,"One of the strangest-smelling wines we've encountered from Spain: there's forced cinnamon, heavy funk, dampness and other unfamiliar, foreign scents. The palate has weight and a gritty feeel, while the core flavors are Sherried. Hard to see the appeal here.",Veleta Nolados,81,16,Andalucia,Vino de la Tierra Contraviesa Alpujarra,NA,Red Blend,Dominio Buenavista
137096,Spain,"Funky, sour, gumball aromas and flavors, and then not a whole lot else. Short on character, with little to make note of other than sweaty berry flavors, tartness and bramble.",NA,80,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo,Terracita
137130,Spain,"A little more herbal, stalky and tomato-influenced than the riper, fresher 2005, but still an elegant, complex wine that shines a positive light on this little-known region at the base of the Pyrenees. Tobacco, tomato leaf, root beer and bouillon flavors set up an herbal, almost Bordeaux-like finish. Layered and structured to boot. Drink now through 2012.",Blecua,90,100,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Red Blend,Viñas del Vero
137140,Spain,"Full and dark, with aromas of bacon, crusty minerality, black fruits and spice. Balanced yet bullish, with integrated tannins and toasty, coffee-infused flavors that go straight to black. Long and showing additional coffee on the finish. Drinkable now.",Crianza,90,30,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Felix Callejo
137151,Spain,"Aromas of leather, smoked meats, charred oak and lacquer are not for the weak, while the mouthfeel is firm, deep and just right. Juicy and bright in terms of flavors, with black cherry, vanilla and coconut. Toasty and alert on the finish, but with smacking tannins. Drinkable now and good for another four or five years.",Reserva,90,19,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Beronia
137163,Spain,"Broad-shouldered and muscled-up, this hearty wine seems more youthful than it is. The nose is spicy and full of lively berry aromas, while the palate is laced with red cherry, raspberry and vanilla. It's a classic gran reserva with dried qualities and spice. It's right on the money.",Coto de Imaz Gran Reserva,91,39,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,El Coto
137169,Spain,"Bramble, cherry cola and snappy red berry aromas announce this as a secure, snappy wine. The flavor profile is round, genial and nicely balanced between plum and berry and vanilla/mocha notes. Like most Sierra Cantabria reds, this touches all the bases and should elicit a smile of satisfaction.",Cuvée Especial,91,24,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
137190,Spain,"Slightly more leafy, herbal and burnt on the nose than ideal, but there's also tobacco, cherry and earth notes to keep it proper. The palate is smooth in feel, with good depth, while the flavor profile has a salty side as well as black cherry and molasses. Good wine with a few issues.",Crianza,87,24,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Pago del Vostal
137191,Spain,"Raisiny, sweet and baked, with plenty of oak coming on as it airs out. This vintage is somewhat syrupy and strained compared to prior years, with baked black fruit flavors. Seems a little reduced on the finish, but overall it's still good given this winery's strong track record and how the wine compares to other 2007 Riojas.",Propiedad,87,40,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Palacios Remondo
137200,Spain,"Solid, big and fruity, which is basically what a Campo de Borja Garnacha should be. Sweet red fruits and robust kick define the palate, which is tannic but not obtrusively so. Zesty and a bit of a one-noter, but a nice one. Garnacha with 30% Syrah and 10% Mourvèdre.",Lot 98,87,10,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Red Blend,Cameron Hughes
137204,Spain,"Dry, dusty and minty on the nose, with cherry, cedar and sweet oak notes. The palate has a hard, clangy bite to it, while the flavors run toward herbal cherry and dried tobacco. Some vanilla and cola along the way bring up the pleasure quotient. Drink now.",Miros de Ribera Reserva,87,50,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Peñafiel
137216,Spain,"Opens with peach and apple aromas that are 100% normal, while the palate has a chiseled clarity to it that's crisp and appreciated. A flavor profile of dry apple, citrus and dusty spice is good, and the finish is fresh and lemony. Drink right away.",NA,87,17,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,La Caña
137273,Spain,"A solid, earthy style of Navarran red wine, with plum, berry and meaty aromas. The palate is forward, with solid flavors of tobacco, plum, tomato and leather. More fruity than herbal, with heat, thyme, mocha and coffee on the finish. Tastes like something from the Old World. Not currently imported.",Malón de Echaide Crianza,87,NA,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodega del Romero
137274,Spain,"Dried fruit, a touch of compost and then bold coffee and mocha aromas give the wine a decent nose, and the palate, while zesty and snappy, is endowed with pretty good raspberry, cherry and strawberry flavors. Overall it's fruity and ready to drink but fairly ordinary, and while we like the wine we can't say it's a knockout.",Barón d'Anglade,87,50,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Franco-Españolas
137341,Spain,"This wine is a “product” in every sense of the word. It's consistent from year to year, and if you know Esmeralda, with its sweet blend of Moscatel and Gewürz, then you know that it delivers simple but pleasant lime, kiwi and cantaloupe flavors with a certain watery freshness.",Viña Esmeralda,85,15,Catalonia,Catalunya,NA,Moscatel,Torres
137343,Spain,"While we'd suggest waiting for the 2007 to hit the market, this softer-styled wine is showing mature melon, tropical fruit and bee's wax aromas in front of mild citrus, lemon and pineapple flavors. It has a medium-weight body and almost a honeyed roundness. Drink now.",NA,85,10,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Analivia
137347,Spain,"White raisin and touches of lettuce and celery give this multigrape blend some richness but also a bit of green character. The palate shows lemon, green apple and pineapple, and this lean quality is confirmed by the wine's modest 11% alcohol level. Drink now to catch it at its scouring, sorbet-like best.",Versatus,85,10,Galicia,Ribeiro,NA,White Blend,Bodegas Campante
137348,Spain,"Matchstick, mushroom and licorice nib aromas add character to this fading but textured wine that struggles to offer peach and nectarine flavors. Expect additional softness with each passing month, and along the way you should only hope to salvage some citrus, white chocolate and melon notes.",Gran Feudo Rosé,85,12,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Garnacha,Bodegas Julián Chivite
137354,Spain,"Dry black cherry and berry fruit shows some early chemical accents, and the wine stays sort of thin and hard all the way to the end. It's peppery and tight, with a simple dark-fruit personality. A little awkward at 14.5%.",Crianza,84,16,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Barzagoso
137441,Spain,"Very dark and oaky, with lemon, bacon, charcoal and high-toned black fruit aromas. The palate is rich and warm, almost heavy, with intense blackberry, chocolate and figgy flavors. Shows very nice texture and size but also tips toward molten ripeness and heavy sweetness. Drink soon.",AlfaSpiga,90,47,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,O. Fournier
137448,Spain,"Dark, sweet and candied on the nose, with hints of raisin and licorice that become more prominent in the mouth. Saturated but also somewhat monotone and single-leveled in terms of flavor, where you get a narrow band of sweet black cherry and raisin in front of a short finish. Very nice as always, but not the best Allende we've reviewed.",Allende,89,26,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Finca Allende
137458,Spain,"A well-made and refreshing wine for the price. The nose is crisp and smells of nettles, grapefruit, cilantro and stony minerals, while the feel is zesty and the flavors bring a mix of green fruits, citrus and tropicality. Stays on point from start to finish. A fine wine for summer sipping.",NA,89,15,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Palacio de Bornos
137479,Spain,"Dark mineral, toasted French oak and black fruit carry the nose. This is a sturdy, nicely made high-end Rioja, but due to the heat of the year its range of flavors is narrow as it settles on baked plum and molasses. Medium long on the finish, with a lasting taste of chocolate.",Dalmau,90,100,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marqués de Murrieta
137492,Spain,"Fairly generous for a bargain-priced, everyday Rioja. There's bacon, rubber, leather and mild oak on the fruity bouquet, while the palate is concentrated, jumpy and hosts honest red berry fruit flavors along with dry oak and a spot of vanilla. Meets any reasonable expectation of what $12 Rioja should be.",NA,87,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
137507,Spain,"Nice for a standard, no-frills type of Rioja. The cherry and raspberry aromas are sweet and clean, while the palate is juicy, fresh and tastes of ripe cherry, berry, vanilla and cream. Offers good clarity, power and depth given its price point.",Crianza,87,8,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Rivarey
137509,Spain,"Slightly dry and leafy on the nose, but with beef jerky, cola and mild raisin aromas. The palate is forward, with controlled heat and tannin along with cola, berry and mushroom flavors. Honest in a traditional way, with a long finish that shows a touch of sweet brown sugar. Drink now.",NA,87,60,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Rento
137587,Spain,"Gets going with earthy, lightly leathery aromas of red fruits, and that bouquet is backed by lively raspberry, plum and fresh-tomato flavors. It's not narrow, but it's hardly broad either. Finishes with a lively herbal note.",Crianza,87,14,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo,Ochoa
137607,Spain,"Look for the wine wrapped in banana-yellow paper, and you'll likely be surprised and pleased by its ripe, clean aromas and easygoing plum and cherry flavors. It's medium-bodied and nice on the palate, with a smooth, nonprobing finish. It's 75% Garnacha and 25% Tempranillo done well.",Castillo de Fuendejalon Crianza,86,8,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Aragonesas
137608,Spain,"Dark, balsamic aromas blend with hints of wood, bramble and briar to give this wine rusticity, while the palate is slick and medium in weight, with black-fruit and tea-like flavors. It's a little narrow on the finish, but there's also a creamy, oak-driven vanilla flavor that softens things up. A good wine that's 70% Tempranillo and 30% Garnacha.",Becquer,86,22,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Escudero
137673,Spain,"A bit too much new American oak was thrown at this crianza, leaving minty, drying aromas that veer into the butter and dill range. The palate is largely fresh and balanced, with peppery red-fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry. A woody encore smothers the finish.",Crianza,84,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,El Circulo
137676,Spain,"Cloudy in color, with tart rhubarb aromas. The palate shows some acidity and tang, with pink grapefruit flavors offering a shrill kick. But overall the wine has seen better days and has become limited in scope at this point.",Rosé,84,11,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,Condesa de Leganza
137677,Spain,"Fiery, hot aromas feature raspberry, burnt leaves, balsamic notes and earth. It's wild and jumpy in the mouth, with rhubarb and cranberry defining the tight, underdeveloped palate, while the finish is tangy and almost peachy. Shows many cool-year characteristics of a 2002.",Reserva,84,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Baron De Ley
137680,Spain,"Fresh peach and nectarine dominate the nose on this semisweet blend of Viura and Malvasia. The flavors are mostly melon and citrus, while the finishing touch is that of fruit cocktail. It's a touch sticky in the long run, but at least it isn't cloying or cooked.",Satinela Medium-Sweet,84,9,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Marqués de Cáceres
137684,Spain,"Aromatic notes of talcum powder and scented candles give this Bordeaux blend from Navarra a light, pleasant bouquet. But the palate is more starching and hard than ideal, leaving a spiky, jagged feel to the wine's raspberry and plum fruit. So rugged and jarring that food is downright mandatory. Ripped but punishing.",Ars Mácula,84,25,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Tandem
137691,Spain,"Rueda is best when it's fresh and dancing, but this 2006 is showing too many signs of the hot year from which it came. It's already tired and soft, with compost and mealy citrus aromas going head to head with grapefruit and marmalade notes. Tasted in December 2007, this was probably a tastier, fresher wine six months prior.",NA,84,16,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Martinsancho
137735,Spain,"Stylish and alluring nose; quite sexy. The malolactic fermentation took place in barrel, so the wine has mouthfeel and richness. Yet it's a juicy, friendly, fruit-forward style of Tempranillo, one that finishes with mocha and wood-driven spice notes. 20,000 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Allende,90,30,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Finca Allende
137759,Spain,"Earthy and fully ripe, with classic Rioja aromas of sweet leather, herbs and a touch of raisin. But once you get it onto the palate you'll be impressed with the roundness of the body and the depth of the cola, cherry and plum flavors. Finishes with cocoa, buttered toast and width. Drink now through 2008.",Reserva,90,29,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Consejo de la Alta
137760,Spain,"Nice on the bouquet, with aromas of licorice, tobacco, earth, mineral and solid berry fruit.

137761,Spain,"Initiates with savory, mildly soupy aromas on top of berry fruit. The palate is plump, ripe and balanced, with mocha, coffee and dark, meaty berry flavors.

137763,Spain,"Miserere offers most of what you'd expect from a high-end Priorat red. The nose features mineral, grilled meat, raisin, berry, cherry and even a citrusy accent. The palate has a full, complete feel and warm flavors of black cherry, licorice and raisin. Very nice but one step short of excellence. Drink now through 2012.",Miserere,89,80,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Costers del Siurana
137767,Spain,"Toasty, earthy, chocolaty and meaty, but not overly fruity or sweet. The palate features solid structure and body, with rooty raspberry, plum, nutmeg and other spice-based flavors. A little rough and short on the finish, with firm tannins. Gets better the longer it sits, so decant or let breathe before pouring.",Cosme Palacio Reserva,89,25,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Palacio
137768,Spain,"Baked, roasted and earthy, with a deep palate of plum, berry and spice aromas.

137775,Spain,"Having not seen the Valsacro wines for several years, it's nice to know that they are up to good things. This is a dark wine dominated by aromas of cassis liqueur and earth. It's lively and structured, with layers of toasted berry, chocolate and black pepper flavors. Shows a lot of shadings and trimmings, including creamy oak on the finish. Drink now and over the next two years.",NA,89,31,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Red Blend,Valsacro
137776,Spain,"Aromas of mineral and jammy raspberry are attractive, yet the palate seems a bit metallic and clicky, with hard to penetrate flavors of rooty fruits, vanilla, coconut and cola. Opens with airing to display secondary berry fruit flavors in front of a tough, firm finish. Nice and ripe, and ready to drink.",Furvus,89,34,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Red Blend,Vinyes Doménech
137784,Spain,"Solid as a rock, with earthy berry and mild herbal aromas. The palate is firm and a touch angular, with sweet raisin, blackberry, candy and chocolate flavors. Long and steady on the finish, with a nice mix of freshness and richness that serves it well. Drink now through 2013.",NA,89,NA,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Mas Dels Frares
137792,Spain,"Opens with unique, abnormal aromas of spiced fruit, cardamom and nutmeg. The palate is thick along the edges but lacks body in the middle, while flavors of red berry fruit are chunky, mildly stewy and roasted. Earthy and funky wine, but with good feel and overall good character.",Nuestro,87,27,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Diaz Bayo
137804,Spain,"Not even El Bosque could escape the difficulties of the cool, extended 2007 vintage. While typically dark and bulky on the nose, it's also dull by Bosque standards, with oaky mocha and coffee stepping in as filler. The body is drawn and tannic, with oak, resin and dark berry flavors. Finishes resiny as well. By no means bad, but given Bosque's precedent it's not stellar.",Finca El Bosque,87,163,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
137895,Spain,"Put this Spanish rosado in the summer rotation. The nose gives you raspberry and strawberry aromas in light, airy form but avoids the candied side of the rosé spectrum. Pink grapefruit and nectarine flavors give it a fresh, clean, Mediterranean style.",Rosado,86,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Rosé,El Coto
137972,Spain,"Take the bubbles out of Cava and this is pretty much what's left. The nose is light, with peach and banana aromas. Tangy flavors of orange and pineapple are lively but lacking, and the finish is ripe but simple. For flush flavors and just enough zap, this is good.",Can Feixes Blanc Selecció,84,13,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,White Blend,Huguet de Can Feixes
137974,Spain,"Oily and citrusy, with pungent, almost nutty aromas that are at once exotic but simultaneously funky and sour. The palate hits with chopping passion fruit and citrus, but there's also some banana to contemplate. In the end, it's just too hard to embrace and go beyond a sip or two, which isn't a great testimonial.",Finca la Colina,84,30,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Sauvignon Blanc,Vinos Sanz
137996,Spain,"Sweet and chunky, like Hawaiian Punch. This is heavy and unctuous at this stage of evolution, with raspberry and ripe melon flavors. Round and no longer edgy. Wait for the 2007.",Rosé,83,9,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Grenache,Marqués de Reala
137999,Spain,"An oaky, awkward, lactic lug that offers a ton of wood grain, funky fruit and a hard, overly spicy mouthfeel. It's trying to do too much with smoke and mirrors; the raw material isn't there.",Cenit,83,47,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Zamora,NA,Tempranillo,Viñas del Cenit
138038,Spain,"Blackberry and cola are the prime aromas that comprise the alluring bouquet. And as you'd expect, there's also leather and spicy wood thrown in. In the mouth, it's an intense ride of rich black cherry and plum. For now it's a little closed on the finish; will likely be better in three years.",Seleccion Personal,89,49,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Abel de Mendoza
138078,Spain,"For an old wine from a weak vintage, this has its positives. For starters, the nose offers a nice mix of dried fruit, tobacco, cedar and fig paste, while the palate is properly acidic and tastes of red plum, raspberry and oak-driven vanilla. At its drinking peak now; with preserved juiciness and lots of kick.",Vendimia Seleccionada 24 Meses en Barrica,87,27,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo,Yllera
138083,Spain,"Nothing over the top but well made and clean, with red fruit aromas that don't overpower. Flavors of peppy plum and berry flavors come across bright and zesty. A comfortable everyday red with with good follow-through and no off aromas, flavors or textures.",NA,86,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,El Circulo
138092,Spain,"Rooty smelling, with cola, sarsparilla, spiced meats and leafy berry aromas. The palate is plump and soft but healthy, with round, sweet berry fruit flavors and ample spice. A generous wine that's hefty, broad and ready to drink. Impressive given that its run is 45,000 cases.",Crianza,89,29,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Matarromera
138095,Spain,"An immense, heavily concentrated and sweet wine with aromas of bacon, wood smoke, citrus peel and jammy berry. The palate is rich and unctuous, so much so that it might qualify as syrupy in some circles. The flavors run toward roasted berries, fig paste and chocolate, and all totaled it's bold but a little overripe. Drink now.",NA,89,77,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,O. Fournier
138105,Spain,"Some patience is required to plow through the early aromas of cherry cough drops, bitter chocolate and smoke, but once you make it past that the wine turns decidedly red and fresh. The palate has tang and a citrusy quality, while flavors of zesty red fruits hint at lemon and pie cherry. A high-toned wine that's ready to drink now and over the next five years with lamb or beef.",Reserva,89,40,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Finca Valpiedra
138106,Spain,"Aromas of apple, fresh hay, pineapple and natural vanilla draw you in, while the palate is lively and fresh, with citrus, pineapple and pithy lemon flavors. Juicy, clean and zesty on the finish, and chiseled in terms of structure and acidity. Very nice Albariño for the price.",Pionero Maccerato,89,15,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Viña Almirante
138111,Spain,"Black as night, with chunky, sweet, candied aromas as well as notes of bacon, shoe polish and cough medicine. This is a classic modern-styled wine with intense roasted berry, herb and exotic spice flavors. Licorine, prune, coffee and oak emerge on the broad finish. Very ripe yet it does a good job of straddling the line between big and overripe.",NA,89,16,Central Spain,Almansa,NA,Red Blend,Atalaya
138150,Spain,"Starts out sort of jumbled, with heavy aromas, deep fruit scents and a shot of leather or animal hide. The palate is healthy, however, with proper acidity pushing earthy plum and berry flavors. Shows good structure and ample size and mouthfeel. The blend is 75% Garnacha and 25% Graciano.",Sur,86,15,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Red Blend,Inurrieta
138240,Spain,"Quite brambly and funky, with a roasted “country” quality that points it toward leather and rubber. An organic wine with 80% Tempranillo and 20% Garnacha; it's sort of tangy and choppy on the palate, with a mix of awkwardly sweet and sour flavors.",Organic,83,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Greener Planet
138246,Spain,"Concentrated aromas of mocha, toffee and burnt coffee bound from the glass, followed by flavors of sour red cherry and berry. Sound balance and soft, dusty tannins make this wine easily enjoyable and easy to drink.",Alate Kosher,83,15,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo,J. Fernández de Arcaya Galdiano
138254,Spain,"So young and simple that one can only describe this as Albariño Nouveau. It's a bouncy, almost spritzy confection with pineapple, green apple and other thin citrus flavors. There's zero body to it, but it is fresh and snappy.",NA,83,28,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Mar de Frades
138275,Spain,"For a good price you get a lot of white wine here. Muga barrel ferments this Viura, so there's popcorn and richness to the nose, but it's not overwhelming. And in the mouth, the lemon, orange and tangerine flavors are flat-out lovely. Pour a glass of this with your next platter of sizzling garlic shrimp and you'll be in heaven.",NA,89,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Viura,Muga
138281,Spain,"Good color and intriguing aromas of baked fruit, tobacco and mint indicate that you're getting some modern-styled ripeness along with traditional Rioja earth, spice and old man's library. The palate is juicy and mildy fruity, while the finish pushes chocolate, vanilla, baking spice and tannins. Drinkable now but will age for another five years without a problem.",Limited Edition,89,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Ramón Bilbao
138283,Spain,"Ysios is one of the most visually pleasing wineries you'll see. It was designed by Santiago Calatrava and it's the town of Laguardia's modern stamp. But until now the wines were just average. This one, however, is far better than that, with pure dried cherry and raspberry flavors bolstered by spicy oak, vanilla and perfect acidity. Drink now–2009. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.",Reserva,89,30,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Ysios
138298,Spain,"Smooth berries and plenty of dark licorice carry the seductive bouquet. And seeing that this is Remelluri's signature high-priced red, you should expect the fine berry, plum and chocolate flavors that rest comfortably on the palate. But like many '02s, the wine has a hard mouthfeel and pronounced acidity, so it doesn't quite trigger all the pleasure points that it might in a better vintage.",Colección Jaime Rodríguez,89,104,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,"Granja Ntra, Sra. de Remelluri"
138299,Spain,"Bramble bush, graphite, leather and medium-depth fruit are the opening notes on this qualm-free, fairly muscular Rioja.

Very nice for a 2002.",Remelluri,89,31,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,"Granja Ntra, Sra. de Remelluri"
138457,Spain,"Two vintages running this is good, even-flowing rosé. The color is on the red side, but the nose dials in on fluffy red-berry aromas. Plum is the primary fruit flavor, and there's body and a flame of heat and spice to the finish. A good food wine to drink now.",NA,86,10,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,Rosé,Tapeña
138462,Spain,"Light cherry and raspberry aromas take it to a level above neutral, while the palate is just as clean and light, with apricot, peach and strawberry flavors. With some tang and good acidity, it shows freshness and persistence.",Rosado de Lagrima,86,11,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Garnacha,Viña Sardasol
138463,Spain,"Initially it smells a bit cheesy and drawn, but with time it evolves to show plum, raspberry and tire rubber aromas. In the mouth, it's tight, fresh and a little gritty, with red-fruit flavors of cherry and raspberry. Not overly generous in terms of mouthfeel, but it does push the fruit until the final bell. More of a food wine than a solo sipper.",Reserva,86,12,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Malumbres
138466,Spain,"Opens with marshmallow-like sweetness on the nose, but that changes to lean fruit and saline with time. The palate is solid and zesty, with standard Rioja-style plum, berry and dill flavors. It's a fresh but quiet wine, with a tight body, medium tannins and pretty good flavors. Well done but nothing unusual.",Reserva,86,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Montecillo
138468,Spain,"Ochoa usually puts out a good rosado made from Garnacha, and this vintage keeps the winery's reputation intact. It starts with fresh peachy aromas and then comes on with light berry and peach flavors. Arguably a bit candied, but perfectly good for summer quaffing.",Rosado,86,9,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Garnacha,Ochoa
138476,Spain,"Light aromas of melon, apple and pear are just fine, and the mildly chunky palate sporting apple-based flavors is good, as is the pineapple finish. Tasty and simple Albariño, and really not much more to say. Good for the summer into fall.",NA,86,10,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Pazo Serantellos
138560,Spain,"Waxy and burning on the nose, and then very heavy and sugary on the palate. The orange marmalade and honey flavors are over the top and sticky, while the wine leaves an unctuous, resinous finish. Too much of this 15% Moscatel could cause a headache.",Vino Dulce Natural,82,18,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Moscatel,Señorío de Sarria
138567,Spain,"With 20% Garnacha, this Navarran Merlot carries a green and lactic streak that makes it a tough go. The palate is gigantic and oversaturated, which makes the whole clumsy and rough.",Palacio de Eza,82,12,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Merlot,Tandem
138592,Spain,"Black cherry and toasty oak aromas greet you, followed by racy raspberry flavors. There's a lot of acid, but there's also ample berry flesh and texture to handle it.

138843,Spain,"Raw and resiny, with no peg for you to hang your hat on. The palate is sharp and short on ripeness, while the finish settles on hot. Just an aggressive wine with little polish. Not worth the price.",Javier Asensio,82,29,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Merlot,Asensio
138857,Spain,"Green, lemony and murky on the nose, this young wine shows that a good vintage in a renowned region doesn't always amount to a good wine. This is a funky, earthy specimen with burnt notes and a grassy aftertaste.",Vall Sanzo,81,13,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Valsanzo
138858,Spain,"Tired and waxy, with canned fruit aromas and almost no measurable freshness. Tastes both sweet and vegetal. May have been better upon release but now it's flat.",NA,81,14,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Lícia
138865,Spain,"Dry, dull papaya and apricot aromas surely don't overwhelm, but they don't foretell the complete lack of fruit on the palate. A faded, insipid white wine. It has no pulse and tastes mealy.",NA,80,19,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Eleusis
138898,Spain,"A little bit leafy and light, but that's traditional Rioja for you. The color is a mix of orange and red, while the palate of snappy red fruits is beginning to slip toward peach and nectarine. If you like a leaner, racier style of wine, then drink this now. It's probably at its peak.",Faustino I Rioja Gran Reserva,88,30,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Faustino
139179,Spain,"Fans of big, blocky reds that offer punch, extract and tannins should jump on this now, and then watch it age nicely for the next four or five years. That's the type of meaty, tannic, fruit-infused Tempranillo this is. It's always going to be short and stocky, but still it will round into shape as it matures.",Crianza,88,19,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Ostatu
139184,Spain,"Early leather and animal aromas soon yield to brighter fruit scents, and that's followed up by a palate detailed by cherry and plum flavors.

139186,Spain,"A heavier, more elevated style, but still well-priced relative to the competition. Expect lusty toast and berry aromas along with a round but juicy palate that delivers chewy berry and plum flavors and some “grasa,” which means fat in Spanish. A cut above most wines in this price range.",Seis de Luberri,88,14,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Luberri
139475,Spain,"Bouquet is nice and smooth, with an earthy warmth surrounding scents of purple flowers and crushed berries. The palate is lively and acidic, with semisweet red-fruit flavors that are more generic. No reticence here; the wine is racy to the end as it finishes with oak and vanilla.",Jarrarte,88,29,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Abel de Mendoza
139476,Spain,"Alert and snappy on the nose, with no “hot” or stewy characteristics from the steamy year. Raspberry and cassis flavors are supported by tight, crisp oak, while the finish offers mineral, coffee and cherry essence. A solid wine from a hellishly warm vintage.",Roda Reserva,88,48,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Roda
139478,Spain,"Stout and generally quite pure, with aromas of leather and berries that thicken and gather density with airing. The palate is your standard new-age blend of dark cherry and raspberry, while the finish is oaky, warm and spicy. Very nice, if a touch jammy and simple.",Mirto,88,38,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Ramón Bilbao
139495,Spain,"Plenty of dusty, spicy aromas run the nose, almost to the exclusion of ripe fruit. But once it opens the wine displays savory flavors as well as some pure dark berry. On the finish, it's a touch lean and crisp, but overall this is a balanced Rioja reserva with spunk.",Reserva,87,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Montecillo
139496,Spain,"A little leafy, a little spicy and a little bit of a throwback to the days when Rioja wasn't taken so seriously. This has light cinnamon oak shadings followed by cola, tobacco and sweet berry flavors. Somewhat acidic and sheer, so better with food; drink now.",Crianza,87,14,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marqués de la Concordia
139497,Spain,"A juicy, prickly wine with pungent red-fruit aromas backed by tangy cherry, raspberry and currant flavors. It's firm and tight, entirely reflective of the cool vintage, and the bet here is that it's unlikely to ever lose that inherent toughness. Needs food to absorb the crispness. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Reserva,87,77,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Remírez de Ganuza
139669,Spain,"Austere, foresty aromas of pine and juniper lead to a snappy, mildly scratchy palate that's acidic and racy. Amid the scour there's vivacious red plum and pie cherry flavors, and then a finish that's tight but controlled. An old-school wine that's fresh and linear.",Flor de Lasierpe,85,22,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Garnacha,Dominio Lasierpe
139672,Spain,"This is a tight, red-fruit dominated style of Granache. It's generic and crisp on the nose, with tart, linear raspberry and red cherry flavors and a dry, peppery finish. Focused and angular, with a foresty, spicy undercurrent. Drink now.",Primeros Viñedos,85,17,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Garnacha,Malumbres
139773,Spain,"Tilts a bit toward the ripe side, with sweet, mature aromas of blueberry, raisin and vanilla. It's fleshy and soft in terms of feel, with earthy, warm flavors of fig, berry and molasses. Drink now for its traditional integrity and tobacco-like qualities; it's not improving.",Coto De Imaz Reserva,87,23,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,El Coto
139782,Spain,"A little tight and reticent, but airing reveals aromas of raisin, marzipan and earth. The palate is measurably peppier, with lean but healthy red-fruit flavors stepping up and demanding to be noticed. As for feel, expect grabby tannins and shortness. Probably at its best now but will hold steady for at least five more years.",Conde de Valdemar Gran Reserva,87,25,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Valdemar
139810,Spain,"Seductive and classy aromas of sandalwood, cola, spice, licorice and leather amount to pretty much everything you could ask for.

Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Coto de Imaz Gran Reserva,91,38,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,El Coto
139811,Spain,"Top-notch manzanilla, plain and simple. What's not plain and simple is the fact that this is so pure and smooth that it dances across your palate. From the vanilla and almond on the nose to the pastry and mushroom on the palate to the creamed butter on the finish, this is as good as it gets in this class.",Manzanilla,91,9,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L.
139950,Spain,"Herbal aromas come with bell pepper and berry fruit notes, while the palate is solid in terms of feel but shows classic Navarran flavors of jalapeño and green pepper. Good texture and mouthfeel, but probably too green for a lot of people. Tempranillo with Merlot and Cabernet is the blend.",Dimension Crianza,85,12,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Otazu
140081,Spain,"Plenty of red berry and jam greet you on the nose, and beyond that there's sweet barrel notes and a little wood smoke. It's smart and snappy on the palate, but not all that long or complex. Finishing notes of tobacco add interest. Tasty and ready to go now.",Crianza,87,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Ramón Bilbao
140089,Spain,"A good effort in a tough year, and frankly we're happy that Muga decided to make a reserva in 2002. The wine shows lean aromas of dried red fruit, tomato leaf and dill. In fact, dill is a recurring theme from front to back. And along the way there's acids, red cherries, plums and currants. Good but leaner than a normal Muga effort.",Reserve,87,23,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Muga
140090,Spain,"Early aromas of leather, rubber and char sort of shadow the fruit component. But in the mouth there's ample blackberry, cherry and pepper, all of which bring the wine into form. In terms of mouthfeel, it's good. And on the finish it's got some of that espresso bitterness that sings of toasted barrels.",La Vendimia,87,30,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Palacios Remondo
140092,Spain,"Healthy in look, with tobacco, dried spices and pure wood notes on the nose. The palate is drizzled with plum and berry flavors, but there's also ample tobacco and tomato-leaf accents.

140108,Spain,"A real surprise! Who in their right mind could expect so much quality from a Cab Franc-Tempranillo blend from Penedès? But try it and we guarantee you're going to like it. The nose is meaty, ripe and round, while the palate features pure core fruit backed by chocolaty warmth. With kick as well as subtlety, this is a bargain hunter's dream. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",NA,91,12,Catalonia,Pla de Bages,NA,Red Blend,Masies d'Avinyo
140127,Spain,"Still young and jumpy, but the ripeness and pedigree of this Penedès bruiser is beyond reproach. It's big, bold and deep as a mountain lake, with black plum, bullion and a pile of blackberry on the palate. Tons of extract and tannins make this inky, saturated heavyweight a wine to ponder.

140176,Spain,"Super pricey but this is a knock-your-socks-off wine with a gorgeous bouquet that shows not even a hint of syrup or jam. The palate is like a nova; it bursts with plum, blackberry and cinnamon. No harshness, not too tannic, and splendid on the finish, where toast and chocolate appear and stick around for a long time. It's 80% old-vines Garnacha and 20% Cabernet, and there just aren't enough superlatives to describe it. Only 300 cases made. Imported by Rare Wine Company.",L'Ermita,98,440,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Alvaro Palacios
140177,Spain,"The 2002 is the current vintage (reviewed in June), but this wine is superior and is just now entering its prime; call it red nectar with a cement foundation.

Imported by Europvin/Michael Skurnick Wines.",Tinto,95,75,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Clos Mogador
140179,Spain,"This reserve-level P.X. sets the gold standard for excellence in sweet sherry. The lovely bouquet straddles the line between unadulterated sweetness and impeccable slyness.

Brilliant.",Cardenal Cisneros Reservas,94,15,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Pedro Ximénez,Sanchez Romate
140180,Spain,"Round and lush, with immense fruit from the nose to the palate. Beautifully balanced, with sweet plum and berry flavors, a lash of smoke and a touch of pepper and thyme. There's nothing raw or earthy about this wine; it's opulent and pure, a testament to vineyard management and great winemaking in a tough year. Doesn't even need much cellar time; drink from 2006–09. Imported by Rare Wine Company.",Finca Dofí,94,70,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Alvaro Palacios
140187,Spain,"A beauty that represents Priorat in its most complete form. Meaty and savage at first, Cims is a terroir wine of the first order.

140188,Spain,"From Daphne Glorian, among the region's original new wavers, Clos Erasmus is simply one of the best, most typical Priorat wines out there. And while the '02 may not rank as a classic, it's still superb. Aromas of graphite, mineral and licorice dominate, backed by layered cherry, plum and earth notes. From four small vineyards around the town of Gratallops. About 450 cases made. Imported by European Cellars.",Tinto,93,125,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Grenache,Clos Erasmus
140209,Spain,"Clearly more serious than average, with light apple and honey aromas that are followed nicely by lime, apple and white-pepper flavors.

140254,Spain,"Sweet and sour aromas amount to a prickly bouquet, while the palate has some flesh as well as freshness.

Good for everyday quaffing.",Gran Feudo Rosado,85,15,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Rosé,Bodegas Julián Chivite
140255,Spain,"The opening of earth, berry and leather aromas is solid enough, yet the palate is quite acidic, yielding semitart but exact flavors of pie cherry and plum.

140370,Spain,"Smooth up front, with a light veil of oak sitting on top of black fruit.

A crianza that gets it right.",Conde de Valdemar Crianza,87,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Valdemar
140388,Spain,"Color and size are readily apparent but gaps appear between the layers. For starters, the nose doesn't have the purity and density that it could; and the palate also shows some weakness where structure and quality of fruit meet. Otherwise, it's a ripe and modern red wine with some lushness and depth.",Mirto,87,65,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Ramón Bilbao
140397,Spain,"Round, clean and a touch leathery, but not penetrating or dense. For a nice, smooth red wine with some plum and cinnamon spice, look no further. This crianza is easygoing, lightly oaked and good throughout.",Crianza,87,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marqués de Cáceres
140446,Spain,"Alluring cherry and berry aromas show a touch of candied sweetness, yet overall the bouquet is magnetically attractive. And the palate is deep and spicy, with tons of red fruit accented by toast and chocolate. And as far as complexity notes go, there's rose petal, lavender and leather. Eminently drinkable; excellent quality to price ratio. Imported by Allied Domecq Wines USA.",Gran Reserva,90,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Campo Viejo
140459,Spain,"A touch of early aromatic raisin gives way to spice, tobacco, tomato and cherry, while the palate is ripe and rich, with flavors of raspberry syrup and prune. Very deep and smooth, with just enough toasty oak to keep things well framed. Imported by Five Star Imports.",L'Espill,90,40,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Celler Cecilio
140491,Spain,"It's rare that a sweet sherry reaches such heights, but here's a case in point. Iberia has impeccable prune and raisin aromas along with intoxicating scents of toffee and cane sugar. All in all, the bouquet is excellent. The palate, meanwhile, is seamless as it deals raisin, vanilla and mocha. Spot on for a dessert elixir, with a ceaseless finish.",Iberia Cream,93,15,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Sanchez Romate
140496,Spain,"Nutty and intense, like peanut brittle reduced to liquid form—but with less than half the corn syrup. It delivers beautiful texture and intensity; it's almost fruity, but then mushroom, almond and macadamia nut take over. With perfect weight and a finish that doesn't quit, this is a great dry Sherry. Imported by Shaw-Ross International Importers.",Don José Oloroso,93,17,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Sanchez Romate
140504,Spain,"Elevated from the first nosing through the multilevel palate and then out the door. Fragrant like an aromatic magnet, with red licorice, wild flower and jammy fruit. A potent brew, with some medicinal cherry to the toasty finish. Super healthy, with an aggressive personality. Could use a year or two to settle because now it's rather tannic. Imported by Europvin.",Clos Martinet,92,58,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Mas Martinet
140509,Spain,"Pure and nutty, with aromas of dried apricot and sea air. In the mouth you get lots of almond and butter, while the A-rate finish is buttery but also quite complex. A classic, refined wine that dances across your tongue like a ballerina. Imported by Shaw-Ross International Importers.",NPU Amontillado,92,17,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Sanchez Romate
140510,Spain,"Sassy and forward, with ripe aromas and exotic flavors. This wine registers at 16% but it's not fortified, so it comes across more like a sweet but dry wine than, say, Port. Expressive and rich, with cherry cough drop, dark chocolate and raisin flavors. At one moment it's table wine, the next an elixir. And the finish won't quit. Perfect with cheese. Imported by Jorge Ordoñez/Fine Estates from Spain.",Dolç de l'Obac,92,98,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Costers del Siurana
140559,Spain,"Initial aromas are squarely in the bell pepper/jalapeño mode, and later moss and earth enter the picture. The palate is basic, a bit acidic, and saucy, with herbal red-fruit flavors and a finish of tomato and basil. Struggles a little, but solid in a “country” sort of way. The blend is Tempranillo, Garnacha, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon.",Reserva,84,40,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Alconde
140563,Spain,"Tan in color and smelling fairly oxidized. Aromas of peach pits and blanched almond lack freshness, while the palate veers more toward applesauce than fresh fruit. There's some life left but not enough to make it a recommended wine. Tastes, feels and smells sort of jumbled.",NA,84,23,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Pazo de Barrantes
140564,Spain,"Chunky spiced apple and saline aromas get the wine off on so-so footing, and the apple and grapefruit flavors come with weight. Citrus takes over on the finish, but it's kind of pithy. Doesn't seem as fresh as it should be for a brand new '08.",NA,84,15,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Nessa
140687,Spain,"A nominally sweet red-candy note helps define the upbeat nose, and it all makes sense once you know that there's 20% Garnacha in the wine along with 75% Tempranillo and Mazuelo. With airing you get nice pie cherry and raspberry flavors, while the mouthfeel is juicy and correct. A good wine for pizza or hamburgers. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.",Crianza,86,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Campo Viejo
140698,Spain,"Ready as it will ever be, this mildly baked red starts with minty aromas and chocolate. The palate is saturated and full of fruit, but the feel is a touch thin given the color and the lightly cooked aromas. Drink now with food and it will satisfy.",Primum Vitae Crianza,86,17,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Vallformosa
140744,Spain,"Quite yellow, with toffee, peanuts and light fruit aromas. Big and round in the mouth, with dried apple, almond and white pepper flavors. Full and long late, with tons of texture and a strong mushroom accent. Powerful, so you'd better be a fino fan if you're going to tackle this one.",Fino Marismeno Reservas,90,15,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Sanchez Romate
140791,Spain,"The definition of old-vines Priorato can be found within this bottle. The Garnacha is very old, the Cariñena even older, and some mature Cabernet Sauvignon adds spine. On the nose, there's a lot of barrique. The palate is snappy, almost acidic, and thus the flavors run toward pie cherry and raspberry. Classic in style; an Old World throwback. Imported by Jorge Ordoñez/Fine Estates from Spain.",Les Eres Vinyas Velles,91,66,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Joan Simó
140792,Spain,"Big and ripe, with tobacco, blackberry and fresh-cut lumber on the nose. This big boy weighs in at 15%, so the chocolate, cassis and rich blackberry flavors on the palate should not come as a surprise. Toasty and plush; a model New World red from Jacques and François Lurton and partner Michel Rolland. Imported by Monsieur Touton Selection Ltd.",NA,91,50,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Campo Eliseo
140797,Spain,"Ethereal and sort of reminiscent of a fine Port, or maybe Banyuls. Pure and ripe on the nose, with licorice, violet and wild blackberry aromas. This is a smooth-drinking wine that's showing some maturity; meaning the tannins are smooth and the acids not too pointed. A real mouthful, with a measure or two of depth. Finishes big. Imported by Winebow.",Montsalvat,91,72,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Francesc Sanchez Bas
140799,Spain,"Intense and colorful; one of the most flavorful and sizable versions of Terrasses on record. Flavors of boysenberry, blackberry and plum sizzle, while the layered palate spreads out nicely upon airing. Everything about this Cariñena-dominated wine is solid and precise. A really nice taste of Priorat at a fairly affordable price. Imported by Rare Wine Company.",Les Terrasses,91,32,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Alvaro Palacios
140805,Spain,"Pure and cerebral, but with enough natural liveliness that you can't help but love it. Aromas of schist, lavender and plum mix with oak-driven bacon and chocolate to create a welcoming whole. Sizable cherry and plum flavors are round but also precise and firm. Looming tannins suggest some cellaring may be warranted. The blend is Garnacha followed by Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon. Imported by Vinum International.",Cartoixa,91,30,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Scala Dei
140809,Spain,"This monster is intensely mineral, with aromas of crushed stones mixed with leather, lavender, pepper and cherry. In the mouth, it's heady with maple, leather, asphalt and cola. Comes at you in layers, the last of which is a finishing flow of espresso. Aged 20 months in new 500-liter barrels, not barriques. Imported by Europvin/Michael Skurnick Wines.",Manyetes,91,70,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Clos Mogador
140810,Spain,"Dark violet in color, with plenty of wood smoke and earth to the nose, which also offers tobacco and mushroom. Dynamic on the palate, with ripe cherry and blackberry flavors. Sort of airy on the finish, with mocha and chocolate. Hefty throughout, with nice tannins. From Marqués de Riscal. Imported by Shaw-Ross International Importers.",Baron de Chirel Reserva,91,60,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Marqués de Riscal
140815,Spain,"Like a freight train, this wine from the village of Poboleda hits with force. From Joan Doix and his winemaking nephew, Ramón Llagostera, it deftly delivers both red and black fruit notes, all on a lightly tannic frame. To call it lip-smacking and juicy would be correct. The blend is 51% old-vines Garnacha, 46% Cariñena and 3% Merlot. 500 cases made. Imported by European Cellars.",Doix Costers de Vinyes Velles,91,85,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Mas Doix
140816,Spain,"Ripe and rich; it pushes the limit toward raisiny but doesn't cross the boundary. As a result, the sweet bouquet oozes kirsch, licorice and spice. Stays thick on the palate, but not particularly heavy. Flavors of baked black fruit, mocha and espresso impress, with accents of cinnamon and herbs popping through. Complex and out of the ordinary. Imported by De Maison Selections, Inc.",Tirant,91,75,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Rotllan Torra
140817,Spain,"Full, tight and entering its prime, this classic Spanish red offers big aromas of leather, blackberry, violets and dried brush. Dense on the palate, with flavors of black olive, tobacco and racy black fruit. Chewy and chocolaty on the finish, with a wash of real-deal tannins. Will age well for at least another five years. Imported by Classical Wines.",Reserva,91,44,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Pesquera
140818,Spain,"Pristine aromas of caramel, orange peel and leather are both powerful and pure. Flavors of toffee, cinnamon, cheddar cheese and raisin are first-rate, while the sum of the parts is brightened and heightened by perfect acidity. A fine Amontillado that should please anyone with a fondness for good Sherry. Imported by CIV/USA.",Amontillado,91,20,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L.
140862,Spain,"Early tobacco and mint aromas quickly yield to mossy black fruit, and in the mouth it's fresh and zesty, with mild green-pepper infused plum and cassis flavors. Quite crisp and lean, with herbal influences showing up at all points. Classic Navarran red wine.",Crianza,84,13,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Señorío de Sarria
140870,Spain,"With raisiny, damp aromas and a flat body, we can only label this Marqués de Murrieta high-ender a miss. While not a disaster, you'd expect more from something labeled Gran Reserva Especial, but instead it fails to capture the essence of Rioja and shows heavy cola, blackberry and truffle flavors as well as deep, dull tannins. Overripe to begin with?",Castillo Ygay Gran Reserva Especial,84,54,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Marqués de Murrieta
140970,Spain,"This is an easy, sweeter style of Viura that emits aromas of peaches and pears. The palate is lively enough but not exactly zesty, and the flavors run toward pink grapefruit and other citrus fruits; but think sweet, nice fruits—not sour ones. Has all the hallmarks of a good aperitif wine.",Cosecha,86,11,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Ostatu
140975,Spain,"Racy on the nose, with tea, pepper and pine scents along with basic red-fruit aromas. The palate is zingy and fairly trim, with strawberry and raspberry flavors. Finishes fresh and snappy, with a shot of tartness. Drink now. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.",Gran Reserva,86,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Campo Viejo
141030,Spain,"Rock solid, with spice, leather and piercing oak on the nose. Snappy and upright on the palate, with tons of berry fruit and nice smoky shadings. Balanced and nuanced, with vanilla, licorice, toast and spice on the finish. A winner. Imported by Five Star Imports.",Clos Monlleó,90,60,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Sangenís I Vaqué
141049,Spain,"Massive yet proportional, with olive, rubber and ripe black fruit on the manly bouquet. The palate is ponderous but tasty, with a huge dose of syrupy berry and black-plum flavors. Ripe as all get out, with firm tannins. To call it a powerhouse would be taking things lightly. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Tinto,90,46,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Red Blend,Luna Beberide
141066,Spain,"Pure Garnacha, which is anathema in the region. Savory on the nose, with roasted meat and spice notes as much as fruit. Once it hits the palate, however, the plum and berry flavors explode. Turns elegant as it opens, while retaining intensity. Flashy stuff. Imported by European Cellars.",Cabrida,91,60,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Garnacha,Capçanes
141070,Spain,"Plenty of smoked meat, hard spice and pulsating fruit to the nose, which evolves greatly if given time. If there's anything to take issue with, it's that the wine is almost too much of a straight-shooter: It's a touch racy and acidic, with a single beam of bright flavors off of which it doesn't vary. Imported by Jorge Ordoñez/ Fine Estates From Spain.",Clos de l'Obac,90,67,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Costers del Siurana
141074,Spain,"Dark in color and extremely nutty. Along the way there are notes of seawater and white plum. The palate is a bit tangy and sharp, with orange peel, almond and butter. Oily and complex on the finish, with a buttery tail and plenty of palate presence.",20 Yr. Imperial Amontillado,90,75,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L.
141076,Spain,"A millennium wine that's now in fine form. It's a typical Garnacha-Cariñena blend that runs heavy on Garnacha. The bouquet is strong and evolved, with leather and mineral along with aromas of crushed flower petals, asphalt and earth. Excellent fruit quality in the mouth; vivid with raspberry and black pepper. 800 cases made. Imported by multiple importers.",6 Vinyes de Laurona,90,45,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Red Blend,Laurona
141080,Spain,"Immediately this white Garnacha registers as something totally different, but more importantly, it's really good. A mere 108 vines yield this lovely anomaly, almost all of which is imported into the U.S. Look for melon and apricot aromas and flavors, along with accents ranging from almond to peach pit to bee's wax. Spectacular texture. 375 cases made. Imported by European Cellars.",Les Brugueres,90,25,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Garnacha,Conreria d'Scala Dei
141083,Spain,"All it takes is a quick sniff and it's clear that this is the real thing. Aromas of sweet black cherry, marzipan and dried earth create a classic bouquet. Additional pure cherry on the palate with chocolate; together they strike the right chord. Harmonious and still worthy of some more aging. Imported by Shaw-Ross International Importers.",Gran Reserva,90,36,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Marqués de Riscal
141159,Spain,"Light cherry and mild sulfuric aromas are standard fare for this class of wine, while the palate is snappy and fresh, with sweet-and-sour cherry and strawberry flavors. Finishes a little gritty and candied, but pleasant enough overall.",Tinto Barrica,84,8,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Red Blend,Don Ramón
141170,Spain,"Varietal Graciano is something we frequently see, and very rarely does it bowl us over. This wine has jumpy cherry and lemon peel aromas, and the flavors are tight, a touch sour and run toward cherry and red plum. Fruity for certain, but lacking in charm and mouthfeel.",Viñedo N° 7,84,15,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Graciano,Señorío de Sarria
141171,Spain,"Round, big and medicinal, with clumsy, roasted berry fruit aromas. The palate isn't overly charming, and the flavors of tomato paste, cranberry and herbal red fruit are curious. Finishes cleansing and zesty, but with another wave of tomato-based flavors. Shows a lot of cool-climate, mountain influence.",Hache Garnacha-Syrah,84,65,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Red Blend,Olvena
141174,Spain,"Baked berry and raisin aromas raise questions about the wine's overall balance, while the plate is sharp and acidic yet tastes of raisin, prune and dried apricots. Rather grabby on the finish. Think slam dancing when approaching this Tempranillo-Garnacha blend.",Señorío de Unx Crianza,83,11,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas San Martín
141178,Spain,"Is it (MS) or the wine? This vintage of Cáceres rosé seems o.k., but nothing more than a splash across the palate. Cotton candy aromas and grapefruit and orange flavors are what they are. Not bad so long as it's fresh, but it's hard to locate much charm or individuality.",NA,83,9,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Rosé,Marqués de Cáceres
141275,Spain,"A throwback Rioja that sports tobacco, mulch and some true Old-World aromas that make you question the wine's health. But airing breathes life and tilts it toward dried cherries. Finally you discover core power hammered home by hard tannins, sharp acidity and an odd nuttiness. Not a wine for all tastes.",Reserva,86,30,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Dominio de Conte
141283,Spain,"As always, this gracious white wine made from the Viura grape delivers the goods. In this case, it's pineapple and pear aromas in front of pleasant apple and fresh celery flavors. There's even some honeyed apple to the finish. Light, liquidy and never bad when served properly chilled.",NA,86,7,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Viura,Marqués de Cáceres
141299,Spain,"For unafflicted plum and berry character, this young, fresh Rioja has the goods. The sweet berry and cherry palate is at peak drinking condition, and the finish runs longer than expected courtesy of a beam of bright acidity. A wine with Zinfandel-like charm. Imported by Pernod Ricard USA.",Crianza,85,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Campo Viejo
141356,Spain,"Almost orange in color but fairly lively on the nose, where cherry, vanilla, leather and licorice come together. Firm and acidic at its center, with surrounding tobacco, cherry and citrus flavors. Shows some toast and root beer on the finish. Very solid stuff from a good vintage. Imported by Five Star Imports.",Gran Reserva,89,21,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Casa de la Reina
141379,Spain,"Dry as a bone, with petrol and green-apple aromas. The palate delivers expected apple and lemon flavors, while the finish is crisp, tangy and a touch tart. Simultaneously acidic and elegant. Classic no-sugar brut nature. Imported by Iberian Wine Importers.",Gold Brut Nature,86,13,Catalonia,Cava,NA,White Blend,Lacatus
141381,Spain,"A bit of roasted corn and hay carry the nose of this semi sweet bubbly. It's round and fruity, with notes of canned pear and hints of sweet spice. Decent acidity and zest ensure that it keeps its balance. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Aria Extra Dry,86,12,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
141400,Spain,"This wine will stick to your ribs, and it'll grab your palate on the way down, leaving quite an impression. Red fruit, leather and toast create a rock-solid, ideal nose. Moderately syrupy and full-bodied, with smooth berry flavors and plenty of vanilla. Finishes long and classy. Imported by Classical Wines.",La Morera de Montsant,90,34,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Pasanau Germans
141413,Spain,"90 Dios Baco Cream Sherry; $20. Sweet and a bit unusual, with aromatic notes of cheddar cheese and barnyard along with more typical toffee and caramel. The palate is confectionary and sturdy, with vanilla, maple and mushroom flavors. Plump and rich on the finish.",Cream,90,20,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L.
141414,Spain,"Five grapes comprise this luscious, intense, well-rounded wine that offers jolting aromas of black cherry, violets and mineral. Fairly plump and succulent relative to the field, with moderate tannins amplifying flavors of black plum, berries, chocolate and wood. Already easy to drink and will hit its prime in 2006. Imported by Jorge Ordoñez/Fine Estates from Spain.",Idus,90,62,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Vall Llach
141418,Spain,"Bingo! An excellent wine from a great vintage, simple as that. Exotic and complex aromas that highlight Middle Eastern spices, a silky palate and integrated tannins, what more could you want? How about a delicious mix of five grapes, incredibly harmonious and food friendly? No surprise it's this good: It's made by the team at Clos Mogador. Imported by multiple importers.",Tinto,90,28,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Red Blend,Laurona
141452,Spain,"Salinic, eggy and simply not that fresh. Maybe it's the wine or maybe it's past its prime, but for Albariño it's not showing much. The palate is soft and flat, with fleshy flavors of muddled apple. And the wine just splats against your palate without delivering any grace or cut.",Gran Vinum,83,26,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Adegas Gran Vinum
141571,Spain,"Fine aromas that announce balance and completeness draw you in, and right away you will like the cherry, red currant and cassis flavors. But as that fruit sits and the acidity builds, the wine goes racy initially and then almost haywire. By the end it almost falls off toward sour. Best right out of the bottle, and with food.",Crianza,85,14,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Castillo Labastida
141574,Spain,"As per usual, this wine carries a leafiness and peppery quality that runs ahead of its fruit quotient. That doesn't mean it's a poor wine; but it emphasizes dry oak and saucy flavors as opposed to richness and ripeness. Best for Rioja traditionalists and those who might drink it with robust foods.",Finca Monasterio,85,43,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Baron De Ley
141593,Spain,"Aromas of cherry sucking candy, sangria and citrus peel are easy and clean but not what you'd call sophisticated. The palate is forward and basic, with tangy cherry and plum skin flavors. It thickens a bit on the finish but always has a racy personality. Better with food due to grabby tannins and acids.",Reserva,85,25,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Ramón Bilbao
141598,Spain,"Seems like Solabal let its reserva-level grapes get a little too soft before picking. The wine has color and potential, but the nose is a little flat and syrupy. The palate delivers ripe dark fruit flavors but also a touch of medicinality. Balance can be fleeting and this wine doesn't have it all the way.",Reserva,85,23,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Solabal
141638,Spain,"Spicy and exotic, with tight fruit and plenty of tannin in the mouth. There's a lot of juicy blackberry flavors along with full-force acids and verve. Tight as a drum, with some rough edges that should mellow over the next year or so. A wine to watch from a region that's showing its stuff. Imported by Bon Vivant Imports.",Crianza,89,27,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Rejadorada
141651,Spain,"Quite ripe, with a touch of stewiness that settles with time and morphs into a pool of ripe cherries, berries and raisins. More soft than hard, with easygoing tannins and a meaty, chunky finish laced with licorice and cured meat. Dense and chewy. Imported by Five Star Imports.",Coranya,89,45,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Sangenís I Vaqué
141652,Spain,"Lots of bacon, leather and earth coat the nose of this vanguard-style Rioja, but unlike the spectacular 2001, the '02 is not nearly as deep and ethereal. Blame the cool, wet vintage and take solace in the fact that it's still a rich, almost syrupy red with integrated tannins and lushness. What's missing is the wine's patented layering and complexity. Imported by Jorge Ordoñez/Fine Estates from Spain.",NA,89,49,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,San Vicente
141668,Spain,"Neutral for the most part, with a touch of toasty wheat and baked apple on the nose. Typical cava petrol invades the palate, but it's overrun by tastier, fresher apple and banana flavors. Exhibits some light toastiness on the finish. Imported by CIV/USA.",Extra Dry,86,9,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Cristalino
141671,Spain,"Colorful stuff, like the flesh of a wild King salmon. The nose offers dried cherry, nectarine and some carbon dioxide. Fresh and tangy in the mouth, with pink grapefruit as the primary flavor despite its Pinot Noir DNA. Good enough to sip on a summer day, but not what you'd call elevated. Imported by Classical Wines.",Brut Reserva Rosé,86,15,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Mont Marçal

141696,Spain,"Offers all the requisite almond and dried stone fruits one could ask for. The spicy palate is racy as can be, with flavors of mushroom, almond, sea salt and white pepper.

141699,Spain,"Fat and dark, with tons of rubber, smoke, licorice and tobacco on the nose. Young and rowdy now, with a texture that's tight as a drum. Still, it exhibits fine cherry, blackberry and flowery characteristics. Comes from a hot zone within Priorat, so it's ripe even in a cool vintage. Imported by Michael Skurnik Wines.",Manyetes,89,NA,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Clos Mogador
141701,Spain,"Initially it's like a pungent strip of fresh-cut oak laid on a bed of leather, but airing reveals black cherry and blueberry flavors and a couple layers of warmth and style. Very nice weight and balance. A little oaky on the nose, but overall it's more than commendable. Imported by Vinamericas Selections.",Crianza,89,30,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Red Blend,Alzania
141703,Spain,"Smooth and open, with pretty cherry, fudge and maple aromas. Rather zingy and stand-up on the palate, where big, rubbery tannins carry full-sized cherry and plum flavors. Finishes with grab and at least two waves of flavor and power. Drink through 2007. Imported by Vinum International.",Prior Criança,89,22,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Grenache,Scala Dei
141706,Spain,"Piercing and pungent, with a bit of alcohol on the nose as well as campfire smoke and citrus zest. Smoky and round on the palate, with big-time nuttiness and plenty of mushroom. A condensed, explosive Sherry that hits hard. Imported by CIV/USA.",30 Yr. Imperial Oloroso,89,90,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L.
141709,Spain,"One of the best of the region, with supreme concentration and style. It's mostly Syrah, and the color is piercing purple. On the nose, it's a touch granular and nutty at first, but eventually dark, meaty black fruit emerges. Tons of black cherry and heft on the palate, with a lasting, smoky finish. Reaches that higher level, although not quite as surely as the fabulous 2001. Imported by De Maison Selections, Inc.",El Bugader,89,60,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Red Blend,Joan D'Anguera
141713,Spain,"Dark in color, with round, malty aromas that run deep. The palate is a bit sweet as well as a bit sharp; think citrus mixed with caramel.

141732,Spain,"An Albariño-dominated middleweight with pure and pleasant aromas of pineapple, citrus and slate. Rich, round and defined, with orange, banana and melon flavors. Very much on the money, with curvy acids as opposed to spiky ones.",Condado de Tea,89,22,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Bouza Grande
141741,Spain,"With its gold luster and strong aromas of fresh-cut wood, you know it's fully oaked. To that end, an overriding resiny scent melds with hints of flowers, melon and butterscotch. The palate kicks up applesauce and spice, while the finish is defined by dry oak and white pepper. Full-bodied and deserving of serious food.",Blanco,88,110,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Gran Veigadares
141879,Spain,"A standard but solid Tempranillo is what you're looking at. The nose pushes red fruit and some American oak aromas like pickle and dill. The feel is fresh and young, but also a little fleshy and substantive. Finishes friendly and smooth.",NA,85,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Darien
141886,Spain,"Perfectly nice, but ultimately basic in its approach. The nose is initally dry and woodsy, with plenty of balsam. Later on, the palate reveals a previously unseen black cherry element, while the finish is crisp and lean. Drink now.",NA,85,11,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
141893,Spain,The kick and acidic foundation of this crianza work in its favor. They balance some of the heavier elements and emphasize the berry core and also the finish. Is it narrow and limited? Yes. But it fits the traditional mold and doesn't disappoint.,Crianza,85,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,El Coto
141898,Spain,"Spicy and reedy in an old-fashioned way. This wine represents traditional Riojano winemaking: it's tight, acidic and endowed with racy rhubarb, raspberry and dill flavors. Pretty full and big on the palate, with touches of green herb and spice on the finish.",Reserva,85,19,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marqués de la Concordia
141918,Spain,"Waxy and sweet on the nose, with aromas of corn and cotton candy. Flavors best described as apple and lemon are weak, and the finishing notes are sour.",Blanco,80,8,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Viura,Montecillo
141939,Spain,"Pedestrian yet entirely solid, with nice citrus and apple flavors. A very easy wine to understand, with seltzer and grapefruit on the finish along with a slight twinge of mushroom. Good cava that will go down easy. Imported by Admiral Wine Imports.",Brut,85,7,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Fleur de Nuit
141952,Spain,"Light aromas of petrol and lemon-lime are entirely correct for cava, and the palate pushes fresh fruit in the tangerine and grapefruit realm. Has a bit of heft and zap, with a dry, largely clean finish. Fine on its own; maybe better in a Spanish-style mimosa. Imported by CIV/USA.",Brut,85,9,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Cristalino
141957,Spain,"Clean but quiet aromas lead to sweet flavors, predominantly candied peach, cantaloupe and dried apricot. Fairly lively in the mouth, almost to the point of being too bubbly. Overall it tastes good even if it's jumpy. Imported by Iberian Wine Importers.",Semi Seco,85,12,Catalonia,Cava,NA,White Blend,Lacatus
141972,Spain,"The nose deals dill, coconut, vanilla and a lot of plum and berry. Soft but not really, with a lively but plush palate that starts with cranberry and raspberry and then deepens to show chocolate and spice. More of a middleweight, but one packing punch; would be nice with roast lamb, etc. Imported by Vintage Wines Inc.",Gran Albina,89,35,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Riojanas
141977,Spain,"Dark as night, with smooth, deep aromas of earth, leather and black fruit. It's a blend of four fairly common red grapes, and together they yield pleasant plum, blackberry and other dark-fruit flavors. Sizable and tannic, but impressive for its clarity and simplicity. Imported by De Maison Selections, Inc.",Finca L'Argata,88,25,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Red Blend,Joan D'Anguera
141986,Spain,"Seductively rich, with blackberry and vanilla aromas. Ripe and chewy, with plum, vanilla and subtle spice in the background. Nice doses of licorice and bitter chocolate solidify the finish. Quite meaty and modern, if a bit pricy for a youngster from a hot year. Imported by Haro Imports.",Joven,88,13,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,Rubiejo
141988,Spain,"A bit transparent in color, but only by Priorat standards. The nose, however, offers all the crusty, earthy red fruit you'd expect; it leads nicely into a palate of sweet cherry, plum and vanilla. Big enough on the finish, with mouthfeel galore. The full package from the town of La Vilella Alta, and not too tannic. Imported by Winebow.",Montgarnatx,88,45,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Garnacha,Francesc Sanchez Bas
142006,Spain,"Mature but not even close to expiring, with cola, root beer, tree bark and leather on the bouquet. Fairly acidic, which is why it has so much verve at 10+ years. Flavors of dried cherry, raspberry and citrus peel are classic in their attack. Very good in an Old World way. Imported by Palm Bay Imports.",Faustino de Autor Reserva Especial,88,50,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Faustino
142008,Spain,"Cherry, earth and leather are nice opening notes, while some charred oak adds masculinity and depth. Almost syrupy in the mouth, with plenty of black cherry and chocolate to satisfy those with a sweet tooth. Exhibits nice core qualities. Imported by Five Star Imports.",Vall Por,88,13,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Sangenís I Vaqué
142013,Spain,"Clean, nutty and smooth, if a touch neutral on the nose. The palate pushes more nuts and distant white fruits, followed by a finish of fleur de sel and cashew butter. Slightly heavy but that's the style; like its sister manzanilla, this wine is very consistent year to year.",La Ina Fino,88,14,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Domecq
142014,Spain,"Quite international in style, a direct reflection of the Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah components that comprise the wine. That said, this is probably the best wine Martinez Bujanda has made at its La Mancha winery; it's plump and ripe, with nice cherry and plum flavors. It's medium in weight and length, and juicy. Likable as can be. Imported by CIV/USA.",Reserva,88,15,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Red Blend,Finca Antigua
142022,Spain,"Modern in terms of its forward oak, extraction and deep color. The nose is packed with charcoal, tobacco and pepper, while the fresh, forward palate pushes cherry cola and baked fruit. Firm tannins, however, close it down, leaving a clipped finish and the perception of only moderate depth. Decant to get best results.",Grans Muralles,88,98,Catalonia,Conca de Barberà,NA,Red Blend,Torres
142023,Spain,"This Bordeaux-style blend features enticing aromas of molasses, licorice, leather and plum, and while the palate satisfies, it doesn't quite live up to the hype built by the bouquet. The feel is soft, as if the edges had slipped away. Still, it offers good mouthfeel and decent depth.",Reserva Real,88,150,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Torres
142034,Spain,"Aromas of dark fruits are distinct and defined, while hints of perfume soften the bullish, rather earthy nose. Classy berry fruit rests comfortably on the palate, while the feel is juicy and tight. Finishes strong, maybe a little sharp, but with full flavors. 100% Cabernet.",Finca la Planeta,88,46,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pasanau Germans
142140,Spain,"CUNE is a throwback bodega whose wines won't appeal to followers of the new wave. And since I consider myself a backer of the modern style, I found this wine too obtuse, funky and borderline dirty to rate higher. It's full of mossy, stewy flavors and the feel is heavy. Traditionalist, however, may find it worthy of greater praise.",Imperial Gran Reserva,84,60,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,CVNE
142143,Spain,"This wine is not up there with the bodega's top bottlings. It's rather sweet and soft, with mildly green and minty aromas. In the mouth, there's size and power but also a strong medicinal overtone that dampens the fiesta. In the end it's big and fruity but there's no sense of path or purpose.",Crianza,84,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Consejo de la Alta
142144,Spain,"Lemon-lime and ginger ale are the opening aromas, while the palate carries green melon and passion fruit flavors. Not terribly intense or complex, with a cider-like spritz to the mouthfeel and finish.",NA,84,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Viura,El Coto
142157,Spain,"Vanilla, raisin and carob aromas announce a level of heft and overripeneness that is never lost or compensated for. It's a jammy, soft, well-aged specimen that doesn't have much life or kick. It does offer ripe, sweet berry flavors, however, and some molasses.",Gran Reserva,84,38,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Ramón Bilbao
142162,Spain,"Raisin, licorice and sawdust are the primary aromas, while the palate runs dry and slightly overdone with oak. It's a decent wine that's neither funky nor faulty; but it is dried out and lean, with apple skin and hard-spice flavors.",Crianza,84,19,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Marques de Tomares
142217,Spain,"Clean and toasty, with mineral and the slightest hint of mushroom. Full and ripe in the mouth, with toasty apple flavors. Limited in depth and complexity, but full of lemon-lime. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Cordon Negro Brut,85,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
142232,Spain,"Gets going in heavy, stewy fashion, with aromas of rubber, asphalt and leather. Picks up speed and precision on the palate, where there's a good mix of strident fruit, vanilla and smooth tannins. A lot is on offer here if you give it time to open up and show its true colors. Imported by Vinamericas Selections.",Crianza,88,25,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,Diez Llorente
142234,Spain,"Raisiny and extremely ripe, with licorice on the nose. Prune, chocolate and fig flavors dominate, while the palate runs as viscous as possible without it turning solid. Probably a bit too syrupy, but loaded with flavor.",NA,88,18,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Pedro Ximénez,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L.
142235,Spain,"From the village of La Morera, this is a jumpy, spiky wine with lively acidity and a racy personality. Aromas of lemon peel, black olive and rock quarry precede a chiseled palate that's quite tannic. Pent-up power for sure, with a blast of toasty vanilla on the finish. Possibly a touch green at its core. Imported by Classical Wines.",Finca la Planeta,88,46,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pasanau Germans
142238,Spain,"More of an approachable Priorat, with plump fruit and modest tannins. It's a blend of five grapes, mostly from vineyards planted in the 1990s, and the aging takes place in one-year-old French oak. Ripe and rich enough to go with hearty foods, but it's not a full-force bruiser. Look for boysenberry and blackberry flavors, hints of cocoa, and a smooth finish. Imported by Jorge Ordoñez/Fine Estates from Spain.",Embruix,88,33,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Vall Llach
142241,Spain,"At 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Garnacha and 15% Tempranillo, this is a bit like a Catalan super Tuscan. Unusual for the region because you can really pick up on the Cabernet component. Overall it's spicy, with hints of tomato, herb and pepper along with textured dark fruit. Good for the money; drink now. Imported by European Cellars.",Costers del Gravet,88,20,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Red Blend,Capçanes
142255,Spain,"Full and still quite bright, with brandied cherry, leather and Tootsie Roll on the nose. Quite full-force on the palate, with forward raspberry fruit. Tannic and grabby, but not raw. Solid in the classic sense, with cola, plum and cherry Lifesaver nuances. Imported by Vineyard Brands.",Reserve,88,22,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Marqués de Cáceres
142266,Spain,"Full and ripe, with tobacco and a certain earthy nuttiness to the nose. Raspberry and plum are the leading flavors, while the mouthfeel is both textured as well as juicy. Full in the middle, with a likable personality. Imported by Five Star Imports.",Reserva,88,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Hermosa
142270,Spain,"Spicy and saucy on the nose, with some leather and cherry mixed in. Shows attractive cherry and tobacco flavors, and they are supported by ripe, pure tannins. This is a tight, ripe wine that is drinkable now and should hold for another couple of years at the very least. Imported by Five Star Imports.",Negre,88,17,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Celler Cecilio
142282,Spain,"Gets off the blocks with Middle Eastern spice notes of cumin and curry, but later on open-cut wood and vanilla take over. Bold cherry, blackberry and black olive flavors are solid, while the mouthfeel is tannic and rowdy. Possibly too grabby for some, but if you like Tempranillo taken to the extreme this might be your ticket. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Real Reserva,88,24,Northern Spain,Cigales,NA,Tempranillo,Museum
142289,Spain,"Big and toasty, with graphite, rubber and leather accenting pure black-fruit aromas. This is one ripe, tannic Rioja, but it's pure and the berry flavors sing a nice song.

142303,Spain,"Miguel Angel de Gregorio makes wines that match his exuberant personality, and Aurus, with 85% old-vine Tempranillo and 15% Graciano, is his premier offering. The 2001's exotic nose pumps licorice, clove, nutmeg and vanilla on top of the ripest black-fruit aromas going. With pillowy tannins, unmatched breadth and huge flavors of blackberry, plum and chocolate, there's no denying this wine's quality and stature.",Aurus,96,184,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Finca Allende
142307,Spain,"Who else but Vega holds wines for more than 10 years before their release? This gorgeous Único spent 104 months in large casks and smaller barrels, yet there's virtually no overt wood. The nose is foresty and complex, with hints of tomato, leather and licorice. Flavors of plum, cherry and vanilla are otherworldly, and there's enough tobacco to conjure memories of a fine cigar. A Tempranillo-Cabernet-Merlot blend worthy of its reputation.",Unico Gran Reserva,95,325,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Vega Sicilia
142310,Spain,"Talk about a wine that's tight as a bank vault. You almost need a pick and axe to get into this bruiser. The bouquet is drawn in, with toast, lemon peel and pure belt leather adding a manly element to the earthy fruit that lurks below. What a pedigree on this single-vineyard alta expressión red, and the coffee-flooded finish goes on and on. Hold until 2009. 125 cases made.",Pesus,95,395,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,Viña Sastre
142311,Spain,"Aalto is one of several smaller projects being led by former Vega Sicilia head winemaker Mariano García, and we think this 2001 Pagos Seliccionados (PS) is his best effort to date. The wine is dark, with charcoal, lemon and pure black-fruit aromas. It features a brilliant luster and deep, rich, syrupy flavors of maple, boysenberry and black cherry. Shows a beautiful finish and amazing depth. Hold until 2006–07.",PS,95,105,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,Aalto
142438,Spain,"Simple and clean, with a pretty rose tint and basic but nice berry and leather aromas. Quite natural, with fresh cherry and raspberry flavors. Full and grabby on the finish as it hits the spot. Drink this year.",Dry,87,8,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Rosé,Marqués de Cáceres
142456,Spain,"Oak, cherry and raisin make for a warm bouquet, and there's initial weight to the palate. But then grabby tannins and cutting acidity take over, pushing the fruit toward zesty, even thin. A light and ready style, for certain.",Gran Familia,84,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Castillo de Fuenmayor
142507,Spain,"Good and fruity, with smoky oak and a ton of natural and barrel-aided spice. Solid black cherry and raspberry flavors sit at the core of this fast-maturing Tempranillo, while racy acidity keeps it fresh and healthy. Notes of cedar and cinnamon are pleasant. Drink or hold through 2008. Imported by 57 Main Street Wine Co.",Reserva,88,38,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Viña Pródigus
142509,Spain,"Lively prune and raisin aromas are nice, even if a bit of alcohol mars the nose. Flavors of caramel and vanilla satisfy, while the sugary finish is borderline cloying but manages to hold the line. Very nice and just right for sweet-toothed sherry novices.",Imported Cream,88,7,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Sanchez Romate
142512,Spain,"Potent to start, with heavy oak notes that conjure memories of pickle barrel and malt vinegar. Airing opens it up, and below there's black cherry, cassis and a lot of sticky, hard tannins. Patience and hearty food are needed, but it has its qualities. Suavity, however, is not among them. Imported by Vinamericas Selections.",Selección Privada,88,70,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Red Blend,Alzania
142519,Spain,"Sleek and fruity, with round, mature aromas and flavors of strawberry and raspberry. Pleasant more than complex, with some acidic verve and a core of healthy fruit. Easy to like, with a lot of flavor. Drink now through 2006. Imported by Jorge Ordoñez/Fine Estates from Spain.",Miserere,88,60,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Costers del Siurana
142533,Spain,"Apple, petrol and mineral define the nose. The lime and apple on the tongue are standard and crisp. Medium weight on the palate, with some sweetness. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Aria Brut,85,12,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
142563,Spain,"With this wine the Egurens of Rioja fame have hit the mother lode in Toro. The '01 version of Termanthia is outrageously powerful and deep, like a shot to the jaw from Lennox Lewis in his prime. It's maxed out in terms of leather, smoky oak, and depth of fruit. Almost hard to describe, it's so big and mauling. Hold until at least 2008. 330 cases made.",Termanthia,95,175,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Numanthia
142565,Spain,"Huge and on the border of overwhelming. But if you like yours concentrated and forward (although arguably not that complex) then Pingus is a dream come true. Start with the bouquet of coffee, earth, black truffle and smoked meat before digging into the wine's saturated black-fruit palate. Big tannins on the finish say lay it down for several years.",Pingus,94,320,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,Dominio de Pingus
142568,Spain,"Yet another portly, gorgeous wine from Allende, one that well serves the single-vineyard train of thought. Entirely international in style, with pure plum, blackberry and vanilla aromas and flavors. Super concentrated and unctuous, with soft tannins and an all-out finish. And the acidity is as integrated and proper as possible.",Calvario,94,88,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Finca Allende
142571,Spain,"Since coming into existence in 1988, this winery has made rich, modern reds that represent the best of what new-age Rioja is about. And the 2001 could be the best yet, as it offers aromas of rose petals, fresh lemon, cola, soy, coffee, leather and more. Definitely a powerhouse, with huge fruit from front to back. Lively in terms of tannins, with the expected monster oak. Employs 10% Graciano in addition to Tempranillo.",Reserva,94,74,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Remírez de Ganuza
142589,Spain,"Super rich and syrupy, which is just the way you want it. But what makes it great is that there's also a giant streak of balancing acidity that runs right up the gut. Reeking of prune, coffee and mocha is the nose, while the palate is pure bliss, a mix of spice, chocolate and raisin. A shining star from little-known Málaga.",Don Juan Trasañejo,94,NA,Andalucia,Málaga,NA,Pedro Ximénez,López Hermanos
142613,Spain,"Clean and sweet, with an aromatic touch of cookies and cream. In the mouth, it's more of the standard lemon, apple and mineral that you expect from this Galician white. Finishes easy and nice, but not too crisp.",NA,87,17,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Pazo San Mauro
142615,Spain,"Loaded with tropical fruit, with ample size to the nose and palate. Tastes more of live-wire citrus than anything else, and the zesty finish definitely hums along at a quick pace. Lasting notes of grapefruit and mineral are typical and welcome.",NA,87,19,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,D. Pedro de SoutoMaior
142719,Spain,"Red cherry, cough drop and a touch of mushroom work the nose, while in the mouth it's crisp and pointed, with light red fruit and citrus-influenced flavors. A lean, lithe wine very much in the pie cherry realm.",Crianza,84,11,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Montecillo
142720,Spain,"This semisweet white can come across likable or awful, depending on your mood and the shape of the bottle you're drinking. The sample we tried for this review was in perfect shape, and it showed tropical fruit and pineapple aromas in front of sugary mango and melon flavors.",Satinela Medium-Sweet,84,8,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Marqués de Cáceres
142734,Spain,"Roasted and woodsy on the nose, with a base scent of raisins. The palate pushes tight cherry flavors and a little citrus, while the feel is uncomplicated and light.",Primi,83,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Luis Gurpegui Muga
142771,Spain,"Aromas of coffee, balsamic vinegar and cedar, but not much fruit, send this wine on its way. Flavors of plum and cherry are standard but clean, while the finish is fruity and offers hints of licorice. A touch sharp but likable.",Crianza,86,10,Central Spain,Madrid,NA,Tempranillo,Merum
142772,Spain,"Big and colorful, with strawberry and rubber aromas. A good amount of citrus and raspberry creates a lengthy palate that forces its game on you. Not a strong finish, but nice along the way.",Rosado,86,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Marqués del Puerto
142777,Spain,"Fairly soft and fruity on first inspection, with some dusty notes to the nose along with a hint of wood. The palate shows cherry, plum and tangy acids. It finishes dry and a bit oaky. Not a complex red, but solid enough.",Reserva,86,26,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Damalisco
142782,Spain,"A touch heavy and sulfuric at first, but better with airing. Aromas of licorice and black plum come right off the bat, followed by flavors of raspberry, spice and pepper. Finishes smooth and in a couple of layers, with a coffee-like bitterness at the very end. Limited but a gritty contender.",Roble,86,10,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Vega Sauco
142788,Spain,"Clean but rugged, with meaty, solid aromas. Cherry, berry and cola create a sturdy, fruity attack, while the finish is round and medium in size. A pedestrian, good red for everyday drinking.",Conde de Valdemar Crianza,86,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Valdemar
142797,Spain,"A total fruitball from front to finish. The nose yields pineapple, peach and grapefruit, while the palate pumps out plenty of apple, lemon and other citrus fruits. Finishes snappy, with zest galore.",NA,86,10,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Palacio de Bornos
142799,Spain,"This is a nice blend of three-fourths Garnacha and one-fourth Tempranillo. It smells sweet and ripe, while the palate features bright cherry and candied fruit. Finishes light and easy, with an added shot of zip and freshness.",Crianza,86,8,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Castillo de Fuendeyalon
142816,Spain,"Hay aromas mix with gritty vitamin notes, while the palate shows white peach and apple flavors. Soft, but it's easy and familiar. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Brut Reserva,84,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas

142835,Spain,"A serious and intense wine, with coffee and mocha on the nose, and a sharp dried-apricot and toasted-nut character on the palate. Power is this wine's calling card, as it hits like a bomb. The flavors are huge, the mouthfeel big but balanced. This is aged Oloroso in top form.",Oloroso Viejo,93,116,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Hidalgo
142855,Spain,"Smooth, smoky and leathery is how this winner gets going, and backing that up is a palate of laser-beam intensity. This offers nothing less than an explosion of plum and cherry flavors, but the style is clean and fresh, not heavy or overoaked. Already it shows nice evolution, as it comes across drinkable. Ethereal in how the finish just slips away. Only 375 cases produced.",Matallana,93,93,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Red Blend,Telmo Rodríguez
142856,Spain,"René Barbier, the pioneer of Priorat, pulled together a beautiful wine in what was, at best, a mediocre vintage. Admittedly, it starts out coarse and grainy, but airing shows juicy red fruit and a level of complexity that's up there. More the total package than a collection of spare parts; as a result, it'll drink wonderfully around 2006-07. A mix of Cabernet, Cariñena, Garnacha and Syrah.",Vino Tinto,93,75,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Clos Mogador
142883,Spain,"A commonplace yet good Tempranillo, with red-fruit aromas and some leather. Cherry and strawberry grace the racy palate, which is carried by hard tannins and raw acids. Tastes good but the mouthfeel is rough. A true country wine in every sense of the word.",Crianza,86,9,Central Spain,Ribera del Guadiana,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Canchal
142984,Spain,"Broad-shouldered and bold, but like all Guelbenzu wines, it applies the brakes where necessary. Herbal, terroir-driven characteristics pop up in between the red berry, plum and oak flavors, giving it some boost and nuance. And it gets better with airing, as it delivers coffee and buttery oak at the end.",EVO,88,20,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Red Blend,Guelbenzu
142986,Spain,"Such a pretty pink is this little Garnacha/Cabernet mix; and it tastes and smells great, too. Fruity raspberry aromas blend into the flowery bouquet, while the palate is streamlined by watermelon notes that prime the peach flavors that dominate. A mild dose of pepper on the finish is nice.",NA,88,7,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Rosé,Vega Sindoa
142987,Spain,"Clean and big, with attractive baking spice and cola aromas. Bright, deep and full of cherry and blackberry flavors, and also fairly sizable and layered. This is the type of friendly, competent wine that should please everyone, from novices up to wine snobs.",Coronas,88,10,Catalonia,Catalonia,NA,Tempranillo,Torres
142998,Spain,"Sweet red-fruit and red-licorice aromas are attractive and round. The palate of peppy cranberry and plum is moderately tart, although it opens up and gets much friendlier if given time. While many wines from this section of Catalonia are big and modern, this one is more restrained and will perform well with food.",Etim,88,14,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Garnacha,Agricola Falset-Marca
142999,Spain,"Grapy, bold and pure, with plenty of black fruit and healthy acids and tannins. Size and drive are what this wine is about; it never steps off the gas, all the while delivering tannic power, some bitter coffee and chocolate notes, and all the blackberry extract you could ask for.",Crianza,88,20,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Alidis
143000,Spain,"Chances are you don't know this tasty little Crianza from near Murcia, which is close to Alicante. The wine has plum and earth aromas along with some wood smoke and citrus peel. A palate loaded with cherry, raspberry and other red fruits is smooth, open and lively. Nice and racy throughout, with the right mouthfeel, one that's neither too much nor too little.",Partal Crianza,88,23,Levante,Bullas,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Balcona
143001,Spain,"Rather thin and transparent to the eye, but that lightness doesn't translate into it being a thin, nothing wine. Just the opposite: It's loaded with leather, cranberry and tea aromas and brisk cherry and cranberry flavors. Some chocolate on the finish adds heft to this old-school wine that really seems to have been made to go with food.",Vina Alberdi Reserva,88,23,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,La Rioja Alta
143005,Spain,"Who knew that crisp, varietally correct Sauvignon Blanc was being made on the plains of central Spain? The nose deals pine and bell pepper, while the palate is zippy and zesty, but filled with apple and banana flavors. A tangy, precise finish with tangerine notes is the final act.",NA,88,7,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Sauvignon Blanc,Penascal
143008,Spain,"The nose seems tight, almost reduced. In the mouth, plum and grapy fruit announce that this is pure Cabernet. It's dark and coffee-like on the finish. What the future holds for it is up for debate. Now it's sort of closed, yet still rather tasty.",Mas La Plana,88,49,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon,Torres
143012,Spain,"Right from the start you know this wine is challenged. The nose is lean and green, with hints of tea and citrus peel. In the mouth, it's snappy and traditional, meaning there's American oak dill notes brushing up against rhubarb and red cherry. Proponents will cite its “classic” character while others will call it thin and not very rewarding.",NA,83,11,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marqués de la Concordia
143016,Spain,"Spearmint and untamed wild berry aromas start it down a slope that ends with a palate that's hot and heavy with fruit but devoid of balance and touch. There's a lot of this and that, namely vanilla and oak. But overall the wine just gets it together.",Crianza,83,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Rioja Vega
143019,Spain,"Cheerful but basic raspberry aromas and flavors is what this young Rioja is about. It feels a little bulky at first, and then acids swell up to cut it short. Almost snappy in the late innings.",NA,83,8,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Rioja Vega
143021,Spain,"This wine is not typical of Allende. It suffered from the heat of 2003 and thus it's overtly aromatic in a prune-like way and out of balance on the palate. If it weren't for the unusual but intriguing molasses aromas and the occasional blast of quality berry fruit, we'd dismiss it outright. Better to wait for the 2004.",NA,83,27,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Finca Allende
143027,Spain,"An attempt at high-end Tempranillo that comes across rough and tough and not too friendly. The nose is rubbery and dark, while the palate is big and generic, with chocolate on the back end. But where this wine gets you is in feel: it's a tannic monster.",Finca los Meriños,83,60,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Luberri
143075,Spain,"Forceful and rustic, with aromas of barnyard, tree bark and black plum. Raspberry and sour cherry flavors create a sharp-edged palate, while the finish is peppery and a touch bitter. Leaves you wanting more.",Tinto Crianza,86,28,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Arzuaga
143081,Spain,"Light and easy, with simple aromas of lemon and wildflowers. Fairly forward and pronounced in terms of fruit; the lemon, pineapple and peach are all right there and lively. Finishes smooth and easy, if maybe a touch watery.",O Deus Dionisos,86,22,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Adegas Galegas
143087,Spain,"A touch prickly and odd at first, with cactus and canned peaches on the nose. More canned, sweet fruit appears on the palate, which is soft and modest from front to finish. Ends with the flavor of pineapple Lifesavers.",NA,86,19,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Morgadio
143093,Spain,"Ruby in color and sweet on the nose. Yes, it's a candied Grenache from central Spain, and while it doesn't overwhelm, it's steady as she goes. Plenty of raspberry and cherry on the palate is backed by a clear, focused finish. A tasty, upright, semisweet red.",NA,85,7,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Garnacha,Castillo de Monséran
143119,Spain,"Butterscotch aromas are backed by a candied palate full of pear syrup. The mouthfeel is soft, and the finish everlasting due to residual sugar. Probably too sweet for most but not badly made. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Carta Nevada Semi Dry,83,9,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
143132,Spain,"Barely a step down from the more rare and pricey Pingus, the '01 Flor should fly off store shelves and restaurant wine lists. It's that good, starting with the intoxicating nose and moving through the pure palate and onto the marvelous finish. A wine that goes all the way, with spice, leather and mounds of rich, ripe fruit.",Flor de Pingus,93,50,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,Dominio de Pingus
143140,Spain,"Sandeman excels with its reserve-level sherries, as is exemplified by this stand-out PX. Figs and raisins are front and center throughout, but it never sits heavily on your palate. Just the opposite, there's plow-through acidity that creates a brilliant mouthfeel and the sensation of freshness. Fabulous by itself or on top of vanilla ice cream.",Royal Ambrosante Aged 20 Years Old Solera,93,24,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Pedro Ximénez,Sandeman
143142,Spain,"Undoubtedly powerful, but lovable. The nose is wholesome and complete, a blend of earth, coffee and heavy black cherry and plum aromas. Broad on the palate, with deep levels of dark fruit mixed with copious French oak. A big-time success in '02, and proof that good wines can come from marginal vintages.",Malleolus de Valderramiro,92,166,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,Emilio Moro
143146,Spain,"The epitome of freshness and complexity is on offer in this delicious late-harvest Moscatel from Navarra's most innovative bodega. Lemon peel, wild flowers and piercing apricot and peach aromas carry the ultra pure nose. There's nothing funky or odd about this barrel-fermented wine; it will appeal to almost everyone who likes a well-made sweet white.",Colección 125 Vendimia Tardía,92,40,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Moscatel,Bodegas Julián Chivite
143154,Spain,"Concentrated but not too heavy, at least not compared to some new-age Riojanos. Asúa shows smoky, toasty aromas and some bright cherry fruit. In the mouth, she's fresh and upright, with just a hint of Bordeaux-style leafiness but zero under ripeness. Toward the finish cola and red licorice flavors come up. Lovely and more subtle than the competition.",Real de Asúa Reserva,92,120,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,CVNE
143155,Spain,"My first look at this fledgling project from the folks at Osborne left me impressed. Sed de Caná is a well toasted, masculine Tempranillo with raw, smoky aromas and a broad-shouldered palate. It toes the line between spunky and tannic, but there's so much forward fruit thrown in that you can't help but like it. Needs several years to settle; best by 2008. 145 cases made.",Sed de Caná,92,NA,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,Bodegas y Viñedos del Jaro
143168,Spain,"Sweet and stewy, with overt oak that comes across as toasted marshmallow topped with melted chocolate. Very ripe, with a rubbery mouthfeel. Finishes with strong coffee and burnt notes along with sweeter jam and fudge nuances.",El Albar Excelencia,86,43,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tempranillo,J. & F. Lurton
143171,Spain,"Big-boned and citrusy, with aromas of oranges and melon. More citrus on the palate mixes with the essence of pear and apple, while the finish is tight and rather long. A bit lacking in depth, but ripe and forward. Satisfyingly simple.",NA,86,21,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Rubines
143180,Spain,"Full-bodied and earthy, with red plum, cola and tomato aromas. The palate mixes leafy, herbal flavors with candied cherry, and the combination proves to have issues. Finishes gritty, with hard tannins. More traditional than modern in style.",Reserva,86,70,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Marqués de Vargas
143256,Spain,"Bacon, sawdust and earth along with cassis and raspberry kick start this lively, acid-driven red. The palate offers tart plum and raspberry, all steered to a point by piercing, laser-beam acidity. Oak plays a prominent role throughout, especially on the finish. The gritty tannins, firm feel and strong acids call for a few years of cellaring.",NA,88,50,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Alion
143267,Spain,"Lush and masculine, and every bit made to emphasize extract and oak. It's dark, with heavy berry fruit, density and ripeness. On the finish it turns even darker, with bitter chocolate and wood smoke. Arguably better at first; airing seems to close it up rather than expanding it. Drink now or cellar for up to five years.",Mirto,88,37,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Ramón Bilbao
143272,Spain,"Chunky and mouthfilling, but it still has lovable characteristics of briary fruit, full-bore acids and a leathery feel. The nose is slightly grainy and animal at first, but it finds its stride. Plum and berry flavors are ripe enough, and the finish offers some chocolate.",Imperial Gran Reserva,88,43,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,CVNE
143274,Spain,"For several years we've been impressed with this under-$10 Merlot, and this year the quality and purity are once again exemplary. Aromas of smoke, mineral and sweet leather set the stage for amplified cherry, raspberry, plum and chocolate flavors. A medium-bodied but healthy and spicy finish secures the final favorable votes.",NA,88,8,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Merlot,Bodegas Luzón
143275,Spain,"Earthy and dark, with forward fruit and plenty of overt wood. With lots of berry fruit, a smooth feel, and fine overall integration, this is a quintessential, well-priced Spanish wine for 2004. There's no flab or fat, but it's not hard, either. A drying, coffee-filled finish with bitter chocolate is the final act.",Rívola,88,14,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Abadia Retuerta
143277,Spain,"The bouquet of this aging Rioja features a good mix of berry fruit, tree bark and earth. Across the palate flows a stream of strawberry, cherry and coffee. Firm tannins create a masculine mouthfeel, while the finish is dry with a tad of buttery oak. Gets better with airing and patient swirling.",Reserva,88,19,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
143278,Spain,"Ruby-red and colorful, with aromas of polished, fine-grained oak. Bright and fruity, but limited when it comes to complexity. It's loaded with chocolate, licorice and espresso, while the palate feel is one of juiciness along with tight tannins. It's aggressive and muscular, not subtle.","Coleccion Privada, Unfiltered",88,38,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
143279,Spain,"The bouquet offers raspberry and strawberry fruit, which is followed by a meaty mouthful of plum, coffee and bitter chocolate. The finish is defined by mocha, and the feel is derived from firm tannins. This wine feels warm, arguably borderline hot. But that's probably more a result of youth than anything else.",NA,88,9,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
143327,Spain,"Stewed fruit aromas with some baked beans on the side just isn't alluring, and the lean, raw, acidic palate that some might describe as traditional isn't clicking in my book. Saving graces include milk chocolate on the finish.",Reserva,82,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Baron De Ley
143332,Spain,"An earthy style with pickle barrel and leather on the nose. Dark berry flavors are muddled, and there's an odd twinge of citrus to the flavor profile. Never really gets it going and seems murky. Two samples tasted.",Don Roman,82,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marques de Tomares
143372,Spain,"Heavy and sweaty at first, with a fat texture and forward fruit. It takes this wine a couple of minutes to show its black core and some spicy heat. Finishes with obvious flavors of oak and coffee.",NA,85,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Cosme Palacio y Hermanos
143374,Spain,"Rather intense and a bit clumsy, but with solid leather, baked earth and charred aromas. The palate is roasted and heavy, with grabby tannins and awkward acids. Finishes with hints of tomato in addition to more acidity.",Reserva,85,57,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Altanza
143375,Spain,"Leather and tar up front, followed by sweet fruit with adequate depth and plenty of plum and berry. A bit soft, touching on overripe, but pretty good despite some burnt, rubbery notes to the finish.",NA,85,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Arbanta
143378,Spain,"Fairly youthful, light and airy, with simple nectarine and melon flavors. Finishes smooth and medium length, with adequate but reserved force. Some finishing notes of creamy pear and sugared citrus zest work well.",viña Reboreda,85,9,Galicia,Ribeiro,NA,White Blend,Bodegas Campante
143379,Spain,"An oak-aged vino joven with a nose of cherry, rubber and raspberry. At first taste, it seems overtly buttery, as if the young oak were sitting atop the wine. As you get into it, that oak seems less obvious and more integrated. Still, it's a touch bland, yet competent.",Roble,85,17,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Carmelo Rodero
143391,Spain,"Starts off with heavy melon and citrus aromas, which are followed by tangy apple and pineapple flavors. Very zesty, with a certain sharpness that dumbs down any complexity that might be hiding.",NA,85,17,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Serra da Estrela
143393,Spain,"Lots of early mint and wood, but then it loses clarity with airing. Flavors of cherry, beet and black pepper steal the palate, which is backed up by red fruit and modest tannins on the finish. Not a lot of nuance here but it's still good.",Crianza,85,15,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Vega Sauco
143425,Spain,"A bit gaseous and funky, with simple dried-cherry and slightly mealy citrus flavors. Gets better with time but never really impresses. Not musty but definitely less than fresh.",Rosé Brut,81,9,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Cristalino
143433,Spain,"This wine shows that old dogs can be taught new tricks. Murrieta is about as traditional as they come in Rioja yet Dalmau is ultra modern. The nose is a smooth mix of plum, raspberry and tobacco, while the sizable palate pushes oak-backed berry fruit. Runs racy but not particularly aggressive. Long and satisfying on the finish.",Dalmau Reserva,92,NA,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Marqués de Murrieta
143434,Spain,"This rather unique wine (made from Mencía) is at the vanguard of the Bierzo revival. It's earthy and leafy, with aromas of red plums and natural spice. The mouthfeel is perfect, as it's just lush and firm enough. Nearly explodes in the mouth, with fine French oak softening the blow.",Corullón Villa,92,40,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Descendientes de J. Palacios
143445,Spain,"From the outset, this beauty oozes character. The whole exceeds the parts by a sum of three, as the wine delivers full flavors, complexity and a near Burgundian minerality. This is what great Albariño is about, even if it's from a hot vintage. Spicy yet thumping with guava, banana and citrus. Simply delicious.",Cepas Vellas,92,33,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Do Ferreiro
143455,Spain,"Alvaro Palacios is indeed a great winemaker, as is evidenced by this blend of Garnacha, Tempranillo, Graciano and Mazuelo. Aromas of bright cherry signify power and structure, yet it's easy as sin to drink. Shows model integration, bursting berry flavors and ripe tannins. Tasted several times during the past year but not rated until now; this wine just keeps getting better.",Propiedad Herencia Remondo,92,28,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Red Blend,Palacios Remondo
143473,Spain,"This Ribera workhorse from before the time RDD was a hot region hangs in there. The rooty nose springs with cola and spice along with dried fruits. Red raspberry and cherry tomato make for a recognizable, traditional palate. An easy food wine; mature now but with some life still in it.",Reserva,86,19,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Mayor
143481,Spain,"Subtlety is not in the calling here. The nose is chunky, with leather and scattered fruit. Sweet plum and berry fruit is bolstered by forward acidity. Condensed and short, but undoubtedly lively.",Lealtanza Reserva,85,25,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Altanza
143486,Spain,"Despite heavy oak, this wine is lean and jagged, with sharp cherry and plum flavors offset by some spice. Quite woody throughout, with a warm, solid finish. Hard tannins create a tight mouthfeel. Flavorful and real, but unforgiving.",Crianza,85,15,Central Spain,Ribera del Guadiana,NA,Tempranillo,Valdeaurum
143552,Spain,"This is a new wine made by Alejandro Fernandez of Pesquera in Ribera del Duero. It's clear, defined and ripe, with earthy, spicy undercurrents supporting potent blackberry fruit. The chewy, deep palate is solid and saturated, leading into a coffee-tinged finish that carries echoes of chocolate. The tannins get larger with each passing minute; drink this with food.",Reserva,88,19,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,El Vinculo
143554,Spain,"Flowery, with a nice mix of sweetness, dried apricots and vanilla. Flavors of banana, papaya and apple dominate a textured, modestly rich palate. Remelluri blends about a half-dozen grapes together for its white Rioja, and the result is smooth, albeit not overly powerful.",Remelluri Blanco,88,40,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,"Granja Ntra, Sra. de Remelluri"
143557,Spain,"The nose is nice; there's cherry, blackberry and mint. Loads of ripe berry fruit draw raves, and the finish is warm, with notes of cream-filled coffee. Tight and firm in terms of feel.",Gran Coronas Reserva,88,20,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon,Torres
143561,Spain,"A touch creamy and lactic at first, but it picks up leathery, more rustic notes with airing. Flavors of plum, blackberry and broad-grained oak lead into a spicy finish with both cinnamon and tree-bark notes. Maybe it's a bit basic, but it's juicy, well made and tasty.",Vi de Guarda,88,48,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Morlanda
143564,Spain,"With its succulent floral aromas, you almost have to be drawn in. Flavors of melon, apple and banana are lengthy and delicious. The only stumbling block is a flat mouthfeel, which some might call plump. Shockingly, this wine is made mostly from the pedestrian Airen grape.",Protocolo Blanco,87,6,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,NA,White Blend,Dominio de Eguren
143569,Spain,"Jammy and sweet up front, and almost like a fruit roll-up as far as aromatics go. The palate is chewy and sweet, with boysenberry and plum flavors. Pretty nice in terms of mouthfeel, and for the most part it's right there. This is ultimately a basic Tempranillo, just the right wine for everyday drinking.",NA,87,12,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Fuentespina
143570,Spain,"Pretty and lush, with a succulent nose. The palate is young, bright and fruity, with lots of raspberry flavor. The tail end is solid, balanced and expansive. With some lavender and crushed rose-petal notes, it has just enough ancillary accents to rise above the masses.",NA,87,12,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Fuentespina
143571,Spain,"Rusty in color, with hickory, leather and dried currants on the traditional Rioja nose. More dried fruit creates a spicy palate, one with cinnamon, pepper and clove. It's fading and still fairly oaky, with fruit secondary to the wood and acids. But isn't that old-school Rioja?",Reserva,87,24,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Barón de Oña
143573,Spain,"The nose is generally sweet and likable, yet there's some medicinal character in there too. Very ripe and dynamic, with mint and chocolate flavors along with fast-moving currant and cherry. A bit racy and unbridled for Cabernet.",Mas La Plana,87,49,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon,Torres
143574,Spain,"Aromas of strawberry and plum lead into a fruity, lightly sugared palate that pours on the friendly red fruit. Well made and perfectly drinkable. What a simple, modern Rioja can and should be.",Crianza,87,16,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Ostatu
143612,Spain,"Never let the price tag dictate perceived quality; you may be disappointed. This tart, choppy, clumsily extracted Tempranillo is a case in point. Where's the balance and mouthfeel? This is why we blind-taste; save your $350.",NA,81,354,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Contador
143623,Spain,"We are big fans of most Sierra Cantabria wines, but this fading, overoaked white Rioja is more or less a dud. It's weighed down by heavy, unintegrated wood notes and the finish is like chewing an oak branch. It's hard to see the point. 250 cases made.",Organza,80,24,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,White Blend,Sierra Cantabria
143627,Spain,". Stand up and take note: this is great wine from Priorat. And that's regardless of whether it is typically Priorato in style. It trades textbook minerality for lushness, and the fruit is star quality. In the mouth, there's an explosion of grape matter that leaves coffee, chocolate, peanut brittle and vanilla. Almost drinkable right now but best from 2009.",NA,96,85,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Vall Llach
143678,Spain,"Sweet and artificial, with a strong hint of Dijon mustard, which seems totally out of place. Not sure who this is aimed at.",Spumante Doux,80,10,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
143703,Spain,"Floral and mildly leesy, with pungent aromas of green apple, citrus and honey. For anyone looking for steely, pure Albariño, the single-vineyard Fillaboa Monte Alto is the ticket. The fruit is crisp and zesty, the acidity just right. And the finish runs a mile long.",Finca Monte Alto,91,27,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Fillaboa
143704,Spain,"It is said that at five years a good cava starts to change for the better, and this seems to be an example of that. Classic aromas of petrol, baked apple and spiced ham precede a sly palate that's both soft and deep. Mild citrus flavors are topped by vanilla and white pepper. Mature.",Ill Lustros Gran Reserva,91,NA,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Gramona
143708,Spain,"Hard and tannic to start with, so it really needs time. Aromas of beef bullion, jerky and soy convey a certain smokiness, which is more geared to the nose than the palate. As for taste, it's laced with black cherry, cinnamon, vanilla and chocolate. Very tight and firm, so hold for another three years.",El Bosque,91,138,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
143723,Spain,"More jammy than previous vintages, with blackberry aromas and notes of bitter dark chocolate. Like any young Priorat stud, it hits firmly with jackhammer tannins, but there's also a likable, soft underside to it. Starts to sing with air and swirling, indicating a bright future. Hold a few years, if possible.",Vino Tinto,91,94,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Vall Llach
143725,Spain,"A poster child for modern Rioja. Seriously extracted, with saturated blackberry, cola and chocolate aromas. Features excellent texture and a fine, tannic finish. If it could offer anything else, it would be additional complexity and variety. It locks onto that fruit-and-chocolate combination and doesn't let go.",Pagos Viejos,91,70,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Artadi
143745,Spain,"This crianza is saucy on the nose, with prune, berry jam and cherry aromas. Zippy and hard, with forward black-cherry flavors. All in all it's a complete red, with nuances of chocolate and spice. Could stand for some food to tame the hard tannic structure.",Manu Crianza,85,60,Central Spain,Madrid,NA,Red Blend,Vinos Jeromin
143786,Spain,"This five-grape blend is based on Treixadura but also includes Albariño, Loureira, Lado and Torrontès. The grapes were picked well into October, so the richness and alcohol are up there. Still, the flowery aromas are alluring and the flavors of mango, pear and apple are clean despite some oak aging. Only 50 cases imported into the States.",Blanco,92,40,Galicia,Ribeiro,NA,White Blend,Emilio Rojo
143816,Spain,"The benchmark among fino-style Sherries is La Gitana. Simply put, it's a classic. Pour yourself a copita of this beauty and sip it while munching some olives, peanuts or pistachios. Shazzam! You're transported to a whitewashed village in Andalusia. Aromas of mushroom and yeast are just as they should be. And deep within are subtle flavors of marzipan and citrus. The long, salty, bone-dry finish cleanses the palate and primes your appetite for better things to come.",La Gitana Manzanilla,89,10,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Bodegas Hidalgo
143854,Spain,"Deep and dark, this is an excellent kitchen-sink blend (it includes Carignan, Merlot, Cabernet, Garnacha and Syrah). For those who like expressive, fruity, no-holds-barred wines, you're gonna swoon for this. The palate is super lush and full of dark cherry, tobacco, herbs and spice, while the finish is mile-long. Outwardly impressive in a modern style.",Idus,93,55,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Vall Llach
143860,Spain,"Lovers of full-bodied, extracted Priorat wines know Vall Llach, and that cult sees Embruix as a good value. The 2004 is on the right track: the nose is almost impenetrable as it oozes blackberry, tar and fine leather. Meanwhile, the palate is like warm berry compote followed by espresso and dark chocolate. Very rich although not overly complex. Best now with steak or cheese, or hold until 2008.",Embruix,92,34,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Vall Llach
143863,Spain,"A barrel buster, with huge barrique qualities including char, chocolate and vanilla along with ripe black-fruit aromas. Spirited is the best way to describe this masculine, tannic bruiser, which is a blend of old-vines Garnacha and Carignan. Hold a couple of years to let it settle, then enjoy.",Amadis,92,60,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Rotllan Torra
143865,Spain,"Powerful is almost an understatement in describing this big boy. The nose starts out fiery and rough before settling to intense. It's all guns blazing on the palate, where tight, racy raspberry fruit holds court. With intense oak and a molten core generating 15.5% alcohol you may want to tread carefully. The ride is not for the weak. Garnacha with Carignan, Syrah and Cab Sauvignon.",Melis,92,90,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Cellers Melis
143878,Spain,"Carignan and Grenache lead the way on this old-vines classic that is typically excellent but not quite as generous, round and whole as in previous vintages. Still, you will be impressed by the compact nose of thyme, sage and tobacco along with dry red fruit. In addition, the palate of cassis and blackberry is pure and tannic as a rock. Needs time; best in 2009–10.",Les Eres Vinyes Velles,91,68,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Joan Simó
143973,Spain,"Fairly typical of a quality PX, with prune, fudge and leather on the nose. Runs a touch syrupy, but the flavors are excellent: the chocolate, raisin and coffee tastes are all precise and stellar. Shows some raw power at times, but also remains subdued.",Rare Sherry Pedro Ximénez Viejo,91,120,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Pedro Ximénez,Osborne
143978,Spain,"Lush on the nose, with wild game, smoke and blackberry filling every void. Almost Syrah-like in its weight, more so than the other Mencía wines that are making a statement. Which only means that it's chewy, chocolaty and creamy. Finishes slightly short, with bitter fudge and vanilla shadings.",Bembibre,91,45,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Dominio de Tares
143980,Spain,"Leathery, earthy and entirely attractive; this is a wine that doesn't seem to have come off an assembly line. The fruit is power-packed, dealing blackberry and plum along with chocolate and spice. In tasting this it's hard to find any faults. Only the hard tannins stand out, calling for several years of cellar time. From Vega Sicilia. Drink in 2008.",NA,91,65,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,Alion
143981,Spain,"An eye-opening, intriguing wine from Somontano, at the foot of the Pyrenees. The bouquet is quite interesting, as it offers herbs, ripeness and intensity. Super dense in the mouth, with pure blackberry and chocolate flavors floating atop dynamite tannins. Tons of flavor; from the Viñas del Vero group.",Vino Tinto,91,NA,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Red Blend,Blecua
143982,Spain,"Inky dark, with coconut, baking spice and leather on the otherwise fruity nose. There's a lumber yard's worth of oak here, but overall it works. The spice element is undeniable, while the quality of the fruit supercedes any raw wood quality. A bit simple and forward, but nothing to take issue with.",Neo Punta Esencia,91,96,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,Bodegas Conde
143984,Spain,"Loads of white fruits and lees, resulting in a nose of pure toast and vanilla. Shows the perfect size and integration, with a creamy feel. Flavors of grapefruit, lime and mineral are at the fore. Classy and refined, with a proper petrol characteristic.",Gran Reserva Brut Nature,91,21,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Jané Ventura
143985,Spain,"A high-water mark for Jean León, which usually sticks to varietal wines. Zemis, on the other hand, is a blend of Cabernet, Merlot and Cab Franc that makes its point. After a tight, bruising, sulfuric beginning, the wine finds its groove, showing black cherry, plum and earth flavors. Thorough and rewarding; a fine red from Penedès.",Zemis,91,126,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Jean León
143986,Spain,"Balanced Spanish whites were rare in the hot '03 vintage, but this one is. Two female winemakers, hence the Two Victorias name, flat-out nailed this Verdejo, which pours on round peach, gooseberry, almond and mineral aromas and flavors. Clean as a whistle, with a finish that hits with power.",José Pariente,91,16,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Dos Victorias
143997,Spain,"Mildly burnt smelling, with whiffs of charred toast and forest fire. Plenty of black cherry, plum and brown sugar comprise the palate, which is also laden with licorice and spice. Numerous merits secure its place in the box seats, but could be too oaky for some folks.",Viña El Pisón,90,145,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Artadi
144004,Spain,"84 Haciendas Durius 2003 Viura-Sauvignon Blanc (Alto Duero); $13. Quite light in color and mute on the nose, with faint apple and honeydew flavors on the smooth but soft palate. Lacks the drive normally associated with these grapes. Despite that, it tastes o.k.",Alto Duero,84,13,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Viura-Sauvignon Blanc,Haciendas Durius
144014,Spain,"Mature, with tomato and dill aromas prior to severe cherry tomato, rhubarb and vanilla flavors. At all points the wine places zest before richness, acid before body. And while it has its aged, old-world virtues, it fails to share much love along the way.",Prior Terrae,84,200,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Viticultores del Priorat
144022,Spain,"Pretty heady, with baked berry fruit, wood grain and caramel on the nose. More oak frames red berry and vanilla flavors, while the light finish starts airy but loses steam quickly. Overall it's lean and lithe, like a ballet dancer.",Viña Pomal Crianza,84,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Bilbainas
144024,Spain,"From the start to the end, this heavyweight from Toro never really gets it right. The burnt rubber notes on the nose fight with a more pleasant blueberry fruit component. In the mouth, there's cherry and plum, but it's kind of medicinal in character. And the palate feel is over the edge, a bit fast and gritty.",Wences Reserva,84,60,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Vega Sauco
144026,Spain,"Brambly and a bit green, with aromas of plum, basil and forest floor. This is one of the more tannic wines you'll encounter; the feel is like a jackhammer pounding away. But within that tannic vise there's adequate raisin, plum and beet-like flavors.",Calchetas Crianza,84,40,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Red Blend,Viña Magaña
144069,Spain,"Palacios started his Valdeorras winery in 2004, and in short order he has established himself as a quality leader. His As Sortes is 100% Godello, from dry-farmed vines with age. This wine is rich, with ample oak, fresh and dry fruit flavors, and a walnut-infused finish. Quite Burgundian in style.",As Sortes,92,35,Northern Spain,Valdeorras,NA,Godello,Rafael Palacios
144072,Spain,"Pezas is the Meursault of Valdeorras. It starts with a smoky, slate-driven nose and then opens to reveal pear, green apple and vanilla flavors. Shows excellent backbone courtesy of refined but powerful acidity. One of Galicia's few ageworthy whites; good through at least 2008.",Pezas da Portela,92,35,Northern Spain,Valdeorras,NA,White Blend,Bodegas Valderroa
144083,Spain,"From extremely old Godello vines, this barrel-fermented wine comes only in magnums. It's currently showing a lot of oak, but it's also extremely well structured. It has an acid backbone that nobody could crack. Very serious, with intense apple, pear and minerality. Much like a fine Burgundy.",Pedrouzos 1.5L,92,80,Northern Spain,Valdeorras,NA,Godello,Bodegas Valderroa
144129,Spain,"One of the best efforts we've tried from Jumilla, Luzon's luxury blend starts with coconut, mint, char and fudge, and below that is a treasure trove of deep black fruit. Huge blackberry and black cherry flavors are potent as they ride on a wave of jolting tannins. An affordable shining star for a rising region.",Altos de Luzón,91,16,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Luzón
144131,Spain,"This younger-vines mix of Garnacha, Carignan, Cab Sauvignon and Syrah is very attractive and loaded with graphite, schisty mineral and black cherry aromas. The palate comes in waves, with the first delivering plum and berry and the second offering chocolate, herbs and lavender. Quite pretty and very tannic. Hold until 2008, if possible.",Les Sentius,91,35,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Joan Simó
144147,Spain,"Intense and deep, with plenty of licorice, leather and pepper encasing serious dark-berry aromas. The wine runs round and full in the mouth, with chewy berry flavors, meaty tannins and a generous finish that's long and just a touch lemony from the wine's 20 months in barrel. A wine that speaks to you.",AlfaSpiga,91,49,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,O. Fournier
144246,Spain,"Heavier than ideal, with earthy berry aromas and accents of cinnamon. Overly ripe, with a lot of meat, pepper and baked berry flavors. Has its merits and faults.",Rosado,84,7,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Grenache,Marqués de Reala
144253,Spain,"Light in color, with some cloudiness. On the nose it's fairly lean and herbal, more similar to French Cabernet Franc or Pinot Noir than your typical muscular Priorat. Flavorwise, expect raisin and raspberry notes before a short, spicy finish.",Criança,84,48,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Morlanda
144274,Spain,"The differences between a good fino and a great fino are usually slight, but this one has pretty much all one could ask for. The nose is crisp, with hints of sea breeze, peanut and tart apple showing through. In the mouth, there's snap, saline and mineral-laden white fruits. Nothing is out of bounds.",Fino Quinta,90,14,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Palomino,Osborne
144276,Spain,"The newest project from Vega Sicilia comes from Toro, where the serious wines are often gargantuan. This has a blinding violet tint and equally forward aromas. In the mouth, it's rock hard, a bruiser of the first order. To drink now would be inviting a tannic overload. Best to hold a couple of years and then serve with a juicy steak.",Vino Tinto,90,50,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Pintia
144277,Spain,"Lots of yeast and lees at first, but still tight, with apple, peach and melon flavors. Turns more toasty and yeasty as it opens, with a hint of dried herbs. A controlled buttery note makes for a fine final impression. One of Freixenet's best.",Cuvée D.S. Brut Nature,90,NA,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
144286,Spain,"Moscatel from the hot plains of Alicante doesn't get much better than this. Yes, it's a bit oxidized and overloaded with caramel, but otherwise it's stellar. Lovely brown sugar, cinnamon and vanilla aromas lead the way for the sun-drenched fruit to do its thing. The result is an over-the-top sweetie that excites.",Casta Diva Reserva Real,90,NA,Levante,Alicante,NA,Moscatel,Bodegas Gutiérrez de la Vega
144290,Spain,"A compact red with aromatic hints of tobacco, violets and dark berries. Fueled in high-octane fashion, meaning it's tight, tannic and forward. While it needs five years to loosen up, now you get refined black cherry and chocolate. A stern drink for those who favor big reds. Tempranillo with 30% Graciano.",Aro,90,179,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Muga
144293,Spain,"In Rueda, sometimes the Sauvignon Blanc and Verdejo taste similar. But in this case there's no mistaking things. This S.B. is sharp, with teeth to the nose and palate. Classic sweaty gooseberry aromas lead to pure citrus, slate and grass on the tongue. As good as you're going to find in Spanish Sauvignon.",Finca La Colina,90,NA,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Sauvignon Blanc,Vinos Sanz
144308,Spain,"Plenty of white flowers and tropical-fruit aromas signal that this is special.

Drinking this baby is like taking a trip to the heart of Salnés.",NA,91,15,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Bouza do Rei
144312,Spain,"Round, fruity and quite exceptional in its class. This Verdejo sets the standard for Rueda; it's loaded with green melon and pineapple up front and backed by bright apple, pear and green herb flavors. Perfectly balanced and fresh. Stands out from the crowd.",José Pariente,91,17,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Dos Victorias
144320,Spain,"Treixadura-based, with Godello, Loureira and tiny portions of Albariño, Torrontes, Caino Blanca and Albilla.

144386,Spain,"Jumilla, a hotbed of luscious new wines from Spain, had the hottest summer on record in 2003. The result is this sweet and fleshy red blend, half Monastrell, 30% Cabernet, and 20% Shiraz. Fruit flavors of plum, berry and cherry fill a fleshy midpalate, and despite the hot weather the alcohol remains at a comfortable 13.5%. There are no pruney, raisiny notes, just fresh, sweet, supple ripe fruit and a hint of white pepper.",Shiraz – Cabernet – Monastrell,88,10,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Mad Dogs & Englishmen
144422,Spain,"You want color and heft? You get that here, and more. Dark, grapy aromas are lush more than rough and tight, while the palate is full of sassy black cherry fruit and a fair share of richness. No doubt this jam-packed blend of Garnacha, Merlot and Carignan is solid and rewarding. 250 cases produced.",Ecològic,91,39,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Genium Celler
144430,Spain,"From a brutally hot vintage, this shows plenty of mineral, schist and cola aromas along with impeccably smooth fruit. It's a little racy and sheer in the mouth, but food will balance that without a problem. And along the way you should enjoy the licorice, cherry, kirsch and other crafty nuances that this fine blend of Cabernet, Garnacha and Carignan has to offer. Drink now through 2009.",NA,91,42,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Red Blend,Mas de l'Abundància
144431,Spain,"Mildly sweet and candied, with accents of rose petal, red licorice and high-quality raisin. As always, it's an intense wine with red raspberry, cherry and plum flavors in front of finishing vanilla and butter. It's a bit grabby and tannic, but it seems to have harnessed correct ripeness in what was a difficult, hot year.",Clos de L'Obac,90,75,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Costers del Siurana
144432,Spain,"Waxy melon and apple aromas are intricate and welcoming, while the melon and citrus flavors are just as they should be. Do Ferreiro is a consistent high-end producer in Rias Baixas and its '05 Albariño is great. It picks up steam as it goes along and will go great with salads and seafood.

144440,Spain,"After a couple of rough years, all Fluminus needed was the good 2004 vintage. And the result is splendid. This blend of Cab, Garnacha and Carignan is pure as can be, with polished leather and fine tobacco aromas entering the fray. The whole is complete and big-boned, but in the end it's more tight and compact than plush. Give it two years to show its best side.",Flvminis,90,28,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Red Blend,Mas de l'Abundància
144449,Spain,"Rustic fruit aromas led by the native Samso grape cause a stir, and the wine, which also has Garnacha, Cabernet and Merlot, carries forth in the mouth, where lush blackberry and plum flavors are supported by healthy, spicy, minty oak. With tight tannins and comfortable acidity, it will drink better in a few years. Imported by Bernard Magrez.",Herència del Padrí,90,75,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Bernard Magrez
144542,Spain,"With density and purity, this is yet another fine Rioja from 2001. Contino is CUNE's so-called “modern” label, and the wine delivers ripe plum and cherry, with oak-driven cinnamon, nutmeg and chocolate playing supporting roles. A textbook 21st-century wine, with all the right parts in all the right places",Viña del Olivo,90,120,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Contino
144544,Spain,"This is a pleasant surprise. From the first sniff you know it's fresh and well made.

It's big, smooth and stands out from the crowd in a positive way.",Brut,90,14,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Gran Gesta
144545,Spain,"An example of a richer-styled Godello, a grape you'll only find in this small region. The nose and body are both full, and despite no oak aging, there are licorice and vanilla shadings to the ripe apple and banana flavors. Something to chew on. Unique.",Sobre Lias,90,NA,Northern Spain,Valdeorras,NA,Godello,Guitián
144546,Spain,"Harmonious and a bit creamy to the nose, with apple, citrus and lees. More citrus and apple on the palate, with an almondy kick.

An excellent, mature cava that still has some grit.",Gran Reserva Personal Brut Nature,90,NA,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Raventós I Blanc
144563,Spain,"Local wine critic Victor de la Serna is the man behind this Syrah from central Spain, and you have to admire its bright purple color and sweet plum and black-cherry flavor profile. Leaner in the middle than the downright gooey 2001, which means it's less jammy and more racy. With 7% Monastrell.",Vino Tinto,90,39,Central Spain,Tierra Manchuela,NA,Syrah,Finca Sandoval
144566,Spain,"I love the funky amphora-shaped bottle as much as the forward nature of the wine. Starts with a full blast of toast, which is backed by a richer butterscotch aroma. This is a cava that provides a big mouthful; the palate is dry and wheaty, while the backing flavors of cinnamon and apple are live-wire.",Kripta Gran Reserva Brut Nature,90,52,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Agustí Torelló
144569,Spain,"A bit more easygoing than the PX wines of Jerez, as it delivers white raisin, milk chocolate and brown-sugar aromas and flavors. The palate is far from aggressive; in fact, it's a little low in acidity, which results in a soft mouthfeel and a short finish. Excellent stuff; just not a classic.",Solera 1830,90,NA,Andalucia,Montilla-Moriles,NA,Pedro Ximénez,Alvear

144590,Spain,"Grassy on the nose, with a touch of green apple to help it along. Melon, canned peach and banana flavors indicate that it was too hot in 2003 for Sauvignon Blanc. Lacks the piquant, zesty quality the wine in known for.",Fransola,83,26,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Sauvignon Blanc,Torres
144595,Spain,"Starts promising, with its dark color and interesting aromas of violets, black cherry and cinnamon. But it's rather heavy and tannic on the tongue, where overbaked black fruit controls the flavor profile. All in all it's fully stuffed and chewy before turning bitter on the finish.",Gueta-Lupia,83,66,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas B.G.
144604,Spain,"In the past we've found this wine to be a bit flat and overwooded, but the '04 is balanced, fresh and downright lovely. Light vanilla and toast shadings accent bright peach and melon flavors, and the texture is something to behold. Excluding Valdeorras, this is Galician white wine in its most refined state.",Barrica,91,21,Galicia,Ribeiro,NA,White Blend,Viña Mein
144607,Spain,"A small portion of the wine went through malolactic fermentation, so it offers a lovely roundness. Features floral aromas backed by pure tangerine and nectarine flavors. Registers more fruity and smooth than mineral, with a perfect finish.",NA,91,22,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Pazo de Señorans
144613,Spain,"A powerful wine with forceful minerality. Still, it's loaded with expressive fruit that falls squarely into the pineapple/mango category.

144668,Spain,"Known first for its Sherry, and second for its Port, Osborne is now making its mark with attractive still wines such as this excellent 80/20 Tempranillo/Cabernet blend. It cleverly bridges New and Old World styles, sending up seductive scents of dried fruits, meat, nutmeg and Spanish leather (wait, I hear a Dylan song in here somewhere!). But there's good fruit in the core, and soft—not dusty—tannins to round out the finish. Drink now or wait five year.",NA,88,8,Central Spain,Tierra de Castilla,NA,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Osborne
144706,Spain,"Alluring bubby, regardless of origin or composition. The bouquet is dry, clean and spicy, with crushed raspberry.

Imported by Jorge Ordoñez Selections.",Rosé Brut Reserva,91,25,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Llopart
144733,Spain,"Sweet, succulent aromas draw you in and while the wine doesn't deliver much nuance on either the nose or palate, we can't quibble with the power, purity and intensity of the blackberry fruit. It's young, tannic and tough now, so give it two years and it should be an excellent wine.",NA,90,47,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,NA,Tempranillo,Mauro

144855,Spain,"Too much funk and animal on the nose, which is followed by a heavy palate of red fruit pumped forward by clamp-down tannins. Patient swirling helps it open up, but how much time should you have to give it?",Reserva,81,13,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo,Palacio de La Vega
144865,Spain,"Dark in color, with questionable cleanliness. In the mouth, it's meaty, big and unbalanced. Finishes with slight mushroom and sherry notes. The grape used is Prieto Picudo.",Molendores,80,12,Northern Spain,Vino Tierra de León,NA,Prieto Picudo,Villacezan
144866,Spain,"The word esperanza means “hope” in Spanish, but there's almost no hope for this sharp-nosed S.B. that has little besides oversized banana and pickle flavors to offer. Barely acceptable.",NA,80,10,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Sauvignon Blanc,Esperanza
144872,Spain,"Dark and intense is this Cabernet-Merlot-Syrah blend. The nose offers smoky leather and hot earth, but also a sweet perfume dominated by violets.

Best to get this one over the next year or two, before the fruit fades.",Reserva Santa Rosa,90,35,Levante,Alicante,NA,Red Blend,Enrique Mendoza
144879,Spain,"Dark and saturated, like a New World wine should be. The nose is lush and smoky, with deep prune, violet and rubber aromas. Rich and lusty on the palate, with bacon, mustard green, clove and cinnamon. Finishes with brown sugar, licorice and coffee.

Round, satisfying and complete.",Reserva,89,17,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas LAN
144897,Spain,"With red-fruit, leather and just enough funky aromas to stir the pot, this wine deserves a whirl. The body and style is somewhat tight and narrow, maybe a reflection of less-than-stellar vintage conditions. Nevertheless, it's got all that you'd want in a young Ribera red.",NA,89,40,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,Dominio de Atauta
144965,Spain,"To date, this year's best value among Spanish white wines is this simple but lovely fruit bomb of an Albariño from the quality-driven Martín Códax cooperative.

144974,Spain,"Full and robust in its approach. The bouquet is fragrant and expansive, with melon and honey aromas pouring forth with gusto.

This wine is an example of just that.",NA,90,18,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Vionta
144982,Spain,"Our favorite among this winery's 2005s, Ambar offers tight, dry, precise aromas backed by driving flavors of melon, peach and orange-blossom honey. Very much on the spot; an Albariño that you can't go wrong with.",Ambar,90,19,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Granbazán
144999,Spain,"This smooth, stylish wine is on the way up, as evidenced by the two-point bump it's receiving from its last review, in December 2004.

Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",Brut Reserva Privada,90,15,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Marques de Monistrol

145047,Spain,"This muscular youth proves that Priorat can deliver fleshy, modern wines. Or maybe it's the 20% Merlot that's softenening the Garnacha and Carignan. Either way, look for lush plum and black cherry flavors floating on a rich, heady palate. This is more Escalade or Range Rover than sports car.",NA,89,32,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Genium Celler

145182,Spain,"Round up front, although not terribly fragrant. The nose shows only subtle berry and game aromas, with a hint of bacon. Very tannic, with a foundation of bitter chocolate and earth.

145184,Spain,"A blend of four white grapes, including Albariño; this is an unconventional wine made in small quantities. Starts with cinnamon and anise aromas that morph toward curry.

Unlike most everything else; could even be better in a cooler vintage like the upcoming 2004.",Blanco,89,35,Galicia,Ribeiro,NA,White Blend,Emilio Rojo
145185,Spain,"A nosing reveals just about everything but the kitchen sink. There's peanut butter, honey, mango and banana, and then later more elaborate sweet fruits rise up on the palate.

It's bold and packed with blackberry, pepper and other spices. It's the perfect wine to enjoy with barbecue, stews and roasts.

145489,Spain,"A barrel-fermented Verdejo, which will work for some and seem wrong to others. The nose is wood-heavy, with smoke, butterscotch and licorice. In the mouth, it's ripe and full of spiced pear and vanilla flavors. A one-trick pony in that it's dominated by oak. Still, the quality of the fruit and oak is solid.",Naia Des,88,28,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Viña Sila
145563,Spain,"More available than most Valdeorras wines—and very good in 2005—Godeval offers a no-nonsense version of the Godello grape. There's typical slate on the nose but even more apple, pear, nectarine and banana. Friendly, with medium acidity.",NA,89,15,Northern Spain,Valdeorras,NA,Godello,Viña Godeval
145566,Spain,"Sometimes you come across an unfamiliar label and it strikes a chord. This wine blends several grapes with finesse and reserve. There's some cedar and toast aromas that lead to raspberry, cherry and coffee flavors. Shows classic acidity, dryness and balance.",Crianza,89,13,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Eolo
145576,Spain,"This winery, with its sketched labels, is classic O Rosal. The wine is 90% Albariño and Loureira, with some Caino Blanca thrown in. The color is pale but convincing, while the palate offers bright apple, apricot and nectarine flavors meshed with cutting acidity.",O Rosal,89,18,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,White Blend,Santiago Ruiz
145577,Spain,"Clean and expressive up front, with floral aromas shaped by doses of grass, apple and pear. Tastes very good, with condensed fruit creating a nice mouthfeel. Very long on the back end.",Val do Sosego,89,NA,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,As Laxas
145583,Spain,"Perfectly crisp and fresh, with touches of tangerine and lemon making it slightly sharp but not the least bit sour. More of a zesty version, with correct acidity, ripeness and balance. Yet another fine match for seafood.",NA,89,19,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Pazo San Mauro
145588,Spain,"All the wines in the Abadal line seem commited to serious aromas and flavors supported by honest structure. This Merlot from an obscure Catalonian wine region offers blackberry, cigar box and raisin aromas in front of additional blackberry flavor. There's also chocolate folded into the finishing layers. Integrated and properlly welded by firm tannins.",Abadal,89,16,Catalonia,Pla de Bages,NA,Merlot,Masies d'Avinyo
145589,Spain,"La Val is an O Rosal winery but its wines are 100% Albariño. This estate-grown white offers a yellowish tint with pretty aromas of buttercup and apple blossoms. It's fairly light-bodied and exhilarating, with pure flavors of apples, honeydew and citrus. Shows good acidity.",Finca de Arantei,89,20,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,La Val
145623,Spain,"Spicy and savory smelling, with interesting aromas that encompass maple, chili powder, smoked meat and mildly baked berries. The palate is round and a little rough in the tannic category. But overall this wine is exceedingly pleasant, well made and pretty much ready to drink now.",Gran Abadia Mediterrània,89,65,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Costers del Priorat
145638,Spain,"If you don't mind some heavy barrel char, then you'll probably like this rough rider. It has espresso and asphalt on the nose, and then you get leathery plum and berry fruit on the palate. A good wine, with a long finish, lots of oak and overall balance. In a nutshell, there's plenty going on.",Valdunes,89,20,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Tierra Adentro
145643,Spain,"Not often do you come across an aged Valdepeñas red, especially one with style, structure and character. The nose of dried fruits and spices also features cigar box and tomato, while the palate of red plum, cherry and tomato is mature. With some length and intensity to the finish, this is perfect to drink now.",Old Vines Gran Reserva,89,22,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Navarro López
145645,Spain,"Scala Dei seems to have managed 2003's tough conditions, and this is endowed with sweet Garnacha-driven aromas that touch up against raisiny but don't cross the line. The palate is plump and loaded with strawberry and vanilla flavors, then chocolate shows up on the finish. The blend is 41% Garnacha, 41% Syrah and 18% Cab Sauvignon.",Cartoixa,89,36,Catalonia,Priorat,NA,Red Blend,Scala Dei
145806,Spain,"Starts shy, but then reveals a smoky nose of dried cherries and freshly fallen leaves. Still fairly youthful on the palate, where plum and cherry flavors are braced by a ripping note of hickory smoke. Barrel notes take over on the finish, but overall it has a lot of what you want from a 21st-century Rioja.",Reserva,88,28,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Darien
145809,Spain,"Round and nutty, with mild floral and honey hints up front. The formula for Tio Pepe calls for a salty, crisp flavor profile with just enough complexity to thrust it into the upper echelon of finos. Slight mushroom and iodine notes appear on the finish.",Tio Pepe Fino,88,NA,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,González Byass
145811,Spain,"An example of a well-made, lightweight red that puts clarity and freshness ahead of bulk and oak. The palate is racy and slick, with some peppery spice and milk chocolate along with pure cherry and raspberry. Finishes warm, tight and spicy.",Crianza,88,19,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Marques de Tomares
145826,Spain,"La Ina always has its own likable style. It's fresh, with plenty of apple character, and always dry as a bone. Maybe it won't overwhelm or surprise, but if served properly chilled, La Ina always satisfies. A quintessential aperitif with tapas and finger foods.",La Ina Fino,88,14,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Sherry,Domecq
145827,Spain,"Sweet and candied on the nose, which  draws you in. Runs a touch chunky, with plum and licorice flavors. Good acidity creates a racy mouthfeel, even teetering on fiery. Tight on the finish, but crisp and fresh. The blend is 80% Cabernet and the rest Merlot.",Reserva,88,NA,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Enate
145829,Spain,"Full and fresh, with pungent leather, tobacco and red-fruit aromas. On the mark in terms of feel, with laudable plum, cherry and earth-like flavors. Entirely holes-free, with ripeness that matches the wine's smooth texture.",Crianza,88,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Vallobera
145869,Spain,"Zesty as all get out, with a touch of spritz. Full melon, nectarine and green-herb aromas set the stage for apricot, peach and citrus flavors. Hails from Condado do Tea and seems racier than most.",Laxas,89,NA,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,As Laxas
145883,Spain,"Lucid in appearance, with mineral aromas adding complexity to the otherwise clean, floral nose. Very dry in style, with apple and pineapple flavors. So crisp and precise that “honest” is the best way to sum it up.",Abadía de San Campio,89,16,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Terras Gauda
145884,Spain,"This Albarino exhibits good signs on the nose, where buttercup, white flowers and apple dance together. Stays solid in the mouth, with round apple, pineapple and light spice notes working seamlessly. Long and full late, with style and grace.",NA,89,22,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Pazo Pondal
145885,Spain,"This Cencibel/Monastrell blend is loaded with black fruit from the bouquet onto the palate. Round flavors of plum and raspberry are balanced and forward, while the finish is full and mouthfilling. A correct, tasty wine that would be hard not to like.",Reserva,88,11,Central Spain,Almansa,NA,Red Blend,Castillo de Almansa
145887,Spain,"A single-vineyard wine made from tear must that was extracted during a light pressing. It's smooth and concentrated, with apple, melon, peach and a touch of white-pepper. Shows good acidity and style.",Bágoa do Miño,88,NA,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,As Laxas
145889,Spain,"Displays pretty aromas of flowers and green apples, with bright, round flavors of peach and apple making for a pleasant palate. Offers a touch of sweetness and honey at its core. Very typical of the 2005 vintage.",Verde,88,15,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Granbazán
145905,Spain,"More open than many, with lemon-lime aromas that work as a nice entry. Full in the mouth, where mixed fruits mesh together. The back palate offers drier citrus on top of a smooth, creamy body. Finishing notes of green herbs and lettuce are welcome. Imported by Jorge Ordoñez Selections.",Brut Exclusive Reserva,89,12,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Marqués de Gelida
145915,Spain,"Regal in presentation, with its faux-metal label and broad-based bottle. And in every edition it's one of Spain's more elegant, serious cavas. Look for slightly toasted, charcoal-based aromas backed by ripe apple and sweet citrus flavors. Very good feel and length. One of Spain's truly consistent high-end bubblies. Imported by Freixnet USA.",Brut Reserva Heredad,89,20,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
145936,Spain,"Plenty of intense new oak sets the nose in a direction toward mint, licorice and black pepper. And that's all good, because the palate backs it up  with prime blackberry and cassis flavors. This is a solid wine with slightly pronounced acids and tannins. Not for those averse to a little grab and kick.",Prios Maximus Crianza,88,26,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas de los Rios Prieto
145941,Spain,"Nicely balanced and a better example of the upside of Navarra than the wines that are based on or include Merlot. The nose shows some herbal character but more deep fruit notes. And in the mouth there's ripe cherry, cassis and plum. Texturally, it's very nice, and when you get down to the nuts and olts it's a very good value.",NA,88,11,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon-Tempranillo,Vega Sindoa
145947,Spain,"Carchelo is at its best in this vintage. This is loaded with wild blackberry and leathery sass, too. Typical of Jumilla, it's big, saturated and packed with ripe berry flavors, jabbing tannins and warmth. A true hot-climate country wine but one with polish and pizzazz.",Carchelo,88,11,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Bodegas Agapito Rico
145989,Spain,"Simple elegance defines this rosado. The color is perfect, the nose is bright, the fruit is forward…everything is in place. Isaac Muga and his sons know how to make rosé. They emphasize flashy fruit and a pure finish, while eschewing oak and weight. Every restaurant in America should serve this beauty by the glass, and every wine drinker should try it at least once. Impeccable with salads.",Muga,89,9,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Rosé,Muga
146100,Spain,"Hailing from a more obscure mountainous region, this Chardonnay-based white blend is a potent brew. The nose offers pointed lime, citrus and cream aromas, which are followed by vanilla-tinged pear and spice flavors. Big boned yet clean, with a piquant finish.",Clarion,88,NA,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,White Blend,Viñas del Vero
146101,Spain,"Begins with mature aromas of toast, sugared pastry and yeast. Ultra dry in the mouth but flavorful, with almost sterile apple and spice flavors. Crisp but forgiving on the finish; a good match for poultry.",Torre Galimany Brut Nature,88,NA,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
146105,Spain,"Impeccably clean, with light tropical fruit gracing the bouquet. A wine that's better than the sum of its parts; the palate is lemony fresh and satisfying, while the overall impression is that of elegance and simplicity. Perfectly good but not overly flavorful.",Pazo Piñeiro,88,35,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Lusco
146108,Spain,"Sweet and grapy on first look, but shows more complexity once you get into it. Rich plum and other black fruits carry the bulky, sizable palate. The finish offers oak in the form of chocolate and mocha. Devoid of serious nuance and depth, but charming in an easy, fruit-forward way.",Albares,88,11,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Dominio de Tares
146109,Spain,"Leathery and smoky, with woodsy aromas as well as the essence of dried red fruits. Like many classic Rioja, it's a touch racy and acidic, but that zest pushes the cherry, cranberry and raspberry fruit toward an even finish. As a whole it's snappy, with a solid core.",Coto Real Reserva,88,42,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,El Coto
146110,Spain,"The crude oil of PX Sherries, Noe won't appeal to everyone. For starters, it's thick as molasses, with heavy caramel and toffee aromas and flavors. And while there's nothing not to like about caramel and toffee, this wine is fat and chewy, arguably too viscous to drink with ease.",Noe Muy Viejo,88,NA,Andalucia,Jerez,NA,Pedro Ximénez,González Byass
146114,Spain,"Starts with a big, dusty nose of cherry, blackberry and forest notes. Fresh and proper on the palate, with plum and boysenberry. Finishes with vanilla and toffee, while the feel is warm and round. Very functional and moderately complex.",Reserva,88,20,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Vallobera
146115,Spain,"There's not a region or grape type that Telmo Rodríguez won't tackle, and here he's on to Moscatel in the deep south. This wine exhibits lilac aromas with hints of smoked ham and hard cheese. It's not a perfect bouquet, but it is intriguing. In addition, look for a bulky but rewarding palate featuring chewy sweet fruit and moderate acidity.",Molino Real Mountain Wine,88,48,Andalucia,Málaga,NA,Moscatel,Telmo Rodríguez
146125,Spain,"Kicks off with a bouquet akin to chocolate-covered cherries before moving on to cured meat and bacon. Strawberry and cherry flavors are touched up by buttery oak, while the finish is so broad that it seems like pulled dough. Shows much of what's good about this appellation.",Reserva,87,24,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Valdubón
146127,Spain,"Begins with tight sulfuric aromas that transform into rubber and red fruit. Flavors of cherry, plum and dried herbs are tart and precise, while the finish offers some tomato. Overall it's a solid, tight wine that gets better with airing.",Reserva,87,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marques de Ulia
146128,Spain,"This well-priced red from Tarragona shows a glimpse of what the Montsant region can produce. The nose is all red fruit, with a splinter of oak. The palate is chunky and easy as it deals blackberry and raspberry in spades. Chocolate and mocha on the thick finish should please the sugar mavens.",NA,87,12,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Red Blend,Fra Guerau
146166,Spain,"A year and a half ago this wine came acorss ripe, robust and not the least bit rustic. But now it's showing many signs of the hot 2003 vintage, including a soft structure and some stewy, leather notes. It's by no means fallen off to the point of being a poor wine, but hasn't improved and should be drunk now for best results.",Exaltos,88,28,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Dominio de Tares
146169,Spain,"More than 80,000 cases of this wine were made, making it “mass” by local standards. But that doesn't mean it's not a quality white. In fact, everything about it is really good, from the crystalline nose to the ripe palate to the clean, exact finish.",NA,88,16,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Condes de Albarei
146172,Spain,"With 30% Loureira and Treixadura added to 70% Albariño, this wine offers sweet pineapple aromas in front of round melon, peach and spice flavors. Rather plump and driving, with a prolonged finish and some distant minerality.",Señor da Folla Verde,88,21,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,White Blend,Marqués de Vizhoja
146175,Spain,"Clean, lucid and attractive, with spindly tropical fruit aromas that veer toward mango, pineapple and passion fruit. A complete Verdejo with all the hallmarks Rueda is known for: apricot and peach flavors, nice acidity, and a crisp finish.",NA,88,14,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Palacio de Bornos
146182,Spain,"You won't find a better, more affordable Bierzo than this. It carries true terroir, heft and solidity but it's not that complicated or racy. Lush black fruit is what defines the palate, while the finish is textured and creamy. Really smacks of natural character and joy.",NA,88,13,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Luna Beberide
146183,Spain,"Floral, with buttercup and acacia on the nose. The mouth, however, is a bit more austere and sharp-edged. It delivers steely, bracing acids and narrow flavors of green apple, lemon and tangerine. A tightlyknit Albariño made for shellfish.",NA,88,16,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Martín Códax
146207,Spain,"Fairly big and yeasty, with earth and mushroom notes that offer complexity to the apple and pear aromas that dominate. Fruity enough, with hints of nutmeg and white pepper. Richly texured with a ton of body. Roundness is its calling card. Imported by Winebow.",Gran Brut,89,42,Catalonia,Cava,NA,White Blend,Juvé y Camps
146224,Spain,"Toasty, yeasty and quite composed given the price point. If you like green apples, ripe pears or lychee fruit, chances are you're going to like this well-blended and fairly smooth Cava. It's persistent and structured enough to go with appetizers or main courses.",Brut Exclusive Reserva,88,13,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Marqués de Gelida
146232,Spain,"Raspberry and a touch of citrus peel make for a light, appealing nose, while the red cherry and red apple skin flavors are cheerful, bouncy and attractive. For a basic Garnacha from Campo de Borja, this has it all: color, fresh fruit, balance and character.",Seleccion Old Vines,88,9,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Mirone
146240,Spain,"Rarely do you find musclebound, intense reds priced at $8 that are this good. But Luzon manages to give you a 65/35 blend of Monastrell and Syrah that is lively, loaded and eminently likable. It's all about hefty black fruit, bold tannins and flash. Only 5,000 cases made.",NA,88,8,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Luzón
146244,Spain,"Brutal heat didn't do a lot for Mas La Plana in 2003. While still a worthy wine, this one shows some green on the nose and palate, while the balance is weightier than normal. In its favor, there's bold blackberry and a touch of cola on the palate. Good but not up to the wine's usual high standards.",Mas La Plana,88,50,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon,Torres
146412,Spain,"Offers an attractive mix of herb, oak and ripe fruit aromas. The palate is sunny, and thus bright fruit in the form of raspberry and cherry shines. Full and lengthy on the finish, with chocolate as the lasting flavor.",Hacienda de Susar,87,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Marqués de la Concordia
146429,Spain,"Thinning, but with catchy aromas of leather, citrus peel, forest floor and cola. The palate offers sweeping dried fruits, mostly cassis and cherry. Meanwhile, the finish is tight and guarded by mature tannins and vital acidity. Interestingly, root beer and turnip show up at the very end.",Gran Reserva,87,23,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Montecillo
146445,Spain,"Starts out flowery and tropical, which is likely a reflection of the 20% Loureira in the wine. The flavor profile is dominated by peach and apple, while the finish runs long due to an infusion of Caino Blanca. A nice wine for those who like tropical fruit flavors.",O Rosal,88,19,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Terras Gauda
146451,Spain,"Valmiñor's signature wine since 2001 is 75% Albariño, with 20% Loureira and 5% Treixadura. Which means it is ultra floral and a touch sweeter than a varietal Albariño. A pleasure to quaff, with citrus and mango flavors.",Davila,88,15,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,White Blend,Valmiñor
146616,Spain,"Broad and rubbery, with ripe black fruit and citrus peel on the nose. Good on the tongue, with a solid mouthfeel. And the finish is   attractively marinated, offering hints of soy sauce, molasses and sea salt. Fresh enough, and definitely forward in thrust.",Reserva,87,34,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Valenciso
146618,Spain,"Chunky and ripe, with more power and potency than precision or finesse. Which still means it's pleasant, warm and tasty. The   palate offers ample raisin and toffee, while the finish is aptly spicy. Good heft and texture, but short in the midsection.",Crianza,87,16,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Lealtanza
146619,Spain,"Looks good in the glass, and smells pretty nice despite a hint of barnyard. In addition, there's cola, vanilla and plum to consider. Fairly meaty in terms of feel, but not overly expressive and not quite reaching the upper echelon. Finishes with some gritty, hard-fighting tannins.",Crianza,87,31,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Páramo de Guzmán
146627,Spain,"Leathery and maturing, as the fruit seems to be on the fade. Dry cherry and raspberry notes carry the aging palate, which is bolstered by ample vanilla. Finishes warm, with licorice and pepper notes. Likable and more traditional, but drink soon.",Reserva,87,14,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Red Blend,Bodega Jario
146633,Spain,"Quite hard on the nose, with classic petrol aromas that almost smell of rubber cement. Tough and tight on the palate; it takes some effort to penetrate. Once inside there's crisp apple and lime zest. A true “nature” in every sense.",Reserva de la Familia Brut Nature,87,20,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Juvé y Camps
146637,Spain,"Plump and fruity, with aromatics of tobacco, leather and dark fruits. Features sweet, sturdy black cherry and plum flavors before a finish of warm earth, plum and vanilla. Very straightforward in its approach, but solid on all accounts.",Crianza,87,19,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,Blasón de San Juan
146638,Spain,"A bit of brett and barnyard on the nose, with minty raspberry coming on to take over. A little leafy on the midpalate, but not what you'd call green. Bitter chocolate carries the finish. A blend of five red grapes, a couple of which are local and virtually unknown.",Marboré,87,34,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Pirineos
146641,Spain,"Highly mineral, with citrus, apple and peach aromas. A touch mute in its flavor profile but still shows enough forward fruit and restrained sweetness to please. Snappy throughout.",Don Alvaro de Bazán,87,24,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Granbazán
146644,Spain,"Starts out showing aromas of turned earth, cedar and embedded plum and raisin. Upright and solid on the palate, where cherry and raspberry flavors are ripe, smooth and moderately complex. Layered on the finish, with fruit, herbs and acidity. Hails from the Alicante/ Valencia region.",Crianza,87,19,Central Spain,Almansa,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Tintoralba
146648,Spain,"The label says the Barker is big, loud and Spanish, and it's right. This wine is a racy, ripe, lively Garnacha with weight, flavor and balance. Tastes good, with cherry, plum, coffee and chocolate all stepping up and taking a bow. Ripe and ready at 14.5%, but on the money.",The Barker,87,9,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Garnacha,Sideshow
146654,Spain,"Pale yellow in color, with elegant aromas and flavors. To call it light would not be wrong: The wine shows grassy citrus notes but it peters out a bit on the back palate and finish. More subtle and fresh than powerful.",Orballo,87,19,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,La Val
146658,Spain,"A masculine, rubbery nose covered with oak and dark-fruit aromas is stage one. Next up comes a spicy, solid palate that has some tannin and complexity to go with dry berry flavors. Not uncommon or unusual. It's got the goods, so to speak.",Doce Meses,87,15,Northern Spain,Vino Tierra de León,NA,Prieto Picudo,Villacezan
146661,Spain,"Clean and pure to the nose, with lemon and other sheer citrus fruit aromas. Gets plump in the mouth, but not fat, with melon and orange-driven flavors. Good, full, mouthfilling and solid. Shows nothing out of the ordinary.",NA,87,17,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Castel de Bouza
146665,Spain,"Lemony gold in color, with mineral-infused apple as the lead aroma. Maybe a bit bigger than average, with some roundness and chunkiness to the palate. Still it's a very good wine, one with additional mineral and citrus on the finish.",NA,87,20,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Palacio de Fefiñanes
146670,Spain,"Round and fruity, with sweet, attractive aromas. The palate is a bit dark for cava, with plum and bitter chocolate flavors. The feel is soft and foamy, with a dry, roasted note on the finish. Clear as can be; easy to tell that it's Pinot Noir. Imported by CIV/USA.",Brut,88,12,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Pinot Noir,Parxet
146672,Spain,"Open and floral, with acacia and orange blossom on the nose. The palate is full-bore citrus, dealing orange and pink grapefruit. Lots of acidity and still full-bodied, with a solid finish that's zesty and lasting. Nice brut cava; offers more than average. Imported by Classical Wines.",Extremarium Brut,88,18,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Mont Marçal
146681,Spain,"Crisp and clean, thus it qualifies as a perfect apéritif wine. Secure in its apple and slate aromas and flavors, with a firm but persistent bead that fosters a fine mouthfeel. Best with nuts, olives, chips and especially seafood.",Reserva Raventós Brut,88,14,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Codorníu
146695,Spain,"Nice and fresh, with defined, attractive apple and pear aromas. Dry and fruity in the mouth, with a tad of sweetness to the firm papaya, lime and apple flavors. Ripe and round enough, with balance. The total packagein cava. Imported by Classical Wines.",Reserva Brut,88,12,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Mont Marçal
146824,Spain,"Seems a touch green and stripped at first, but airing brings it around. Still, there's a lot of fresh wood and resin, which somewhat masks the plum and berry fruit that's eager to emerge. Spicy on the finish, with a decent feel.",NA,86,19,Catalonia,Montsant,NA,Red Blend,Clos Dels Coduls
146832,Spain,"Meaty on the nose, with chunky leather aromas along with mature fruit. In the mouth, it's a touch racy and acidic, which serves to bolster its raspberry and pie-cherry personality. Pretty good overall, with a sizable allotment of zest.",Reserva,86,47,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Altanza
146835,Spain,"Lean on the bouquet; there's almost zero yeast or lees character. But there is an interesting smoked-meat aroma that conjures memories of sausage or ballpark franks. Aggressive in the mouth, with green herbs and paprika. An unusual cava with confusing characteristics.",Aniversario PA 84 Brut Nature,86,70,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Parxet
146836,Spain,"Quite aggressive and murky at first, with a gassy, heavy bouquet of leather, earth and cooked plums. A lot of dryness comes out on the palate, courtesy of starchy tannins and medium-weight red fruit. Finishes with grip, size and a heavy hand. For best results, give it as much time as you can.",Elite,86,55,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Prado Rey
146837,Spain,"Saucy and mildly seductive, with aromas of herbs, leather and exotic spices. In the mouth, however, things seem a touch rustic and burnt. The palate carries some serious zing and spice, but to call it smooth would be a stretch.",Gran Reserva,86,30,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Viña Mayor
146845,Spain,"Fat and melony on the nose, with tons of pear, cantaloupe, almond and vanilla on the palate. Heavily oaked, especially on the finish, where wood resin is mostly what you get.",Vinya Gigi,86,29,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Chardonnay,Jean León
146848,Spain,"Riper and deeper than some in this class, but arguably overoaked and roasted, such that the finish tastes like burnt coffee and the bouquet smells of peeled tire rubber. In between look for plum, blackberry, cumin and black pepper.",Crianza,86,19,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Prado Rey
146849,Spain,"This basic RdD delivers a smooth, ripe nose with doses of forest, bacon, road tar and violets, and there's some plum and blackberry at the foundation. Juicy and raw on the tongue, with racy, slick blackberry fruit. Finishes broad and medicinal, likely a sign of the hot vintage.",NA,86,14,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tempranillo,Valdubón
146852,Spain,"Ripe yet a bit chunky, probably a reflection of this estate's somewhat inland location. Shows sweet grapefruit and almond flavors, with a touch of pithy bitterness on the finish. This winery is owned by Marqués de Murrieta of Rioja fame.",NA,87,14,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Pazo de Barrantes
146866,Spain,"A lower selection of grapes than the winery's superior Dona Rosa results in a fresh wine full of apple, nectarine and minerality. Not particularly complex but goes down nicely. Classic everyday Albariño.",Alba Rosa,87,15,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Adega Martínez Serantes
146868,Spain,"Crisply made, with a strong emphasis on green apples. This is a zesty, flinty white made for warm-weather drinking. Despite being 100% Godello it has a lot in common with Sauvignon Blanc.",Montenovo,87,10,Northern Spain,Valdeorras,NA,Godello,Bodegas Valderroa
146869,Spain,"A bit zesty to start, with a touch of mineral on the nose. Flavorwise, we're talking apple, peach and nectarine. A solid wine with good balance and nothing out or the ordinary.",NA,87,15,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Valmiñor
146875,Spain,"Pineapple, melon and mineral on the nose are welcoming aromas. The mouth is nice, with citrus and melon flavors. Plenty of feel and body, and pleasantly wet, meaning it's fresh, properly acidic and refreshing.",NA,87,27,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Pazo de Eiras
146893,Spain,"Easygoing and balanced, with cream soda and vanilla aromas setting up orange, tangerine and green apple flavors. Crisp and right on the palate, with flowing acidity. Solid, with a touch of green herbs. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Brut Nature,88,14,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
147041,Spain,"Bulky and ripe, with raspberry and punch-like aromas. If you like sweet notes like kirsch, sugar beets and coulis, this has it. Clearly the wine reflects the hot vintage, so it's soft, chewy and bent on sweetness. Good, but not an ager.",Tinto,86,9,Catalonia,Catalonia,NA,Red Blend,Mas Marçal
147043,Spain,"A bulky, fruity style of cava that begins with aromas of floor polish, fruit essence and roasted corn. Shows much more citrus in the mouth, where the flavors run toward orange juice, lime and tarragon. Crisp and apple-based late, but never exciting enough to stir fandom.",Extremarium,86,16,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Mont Marçal
147046,Spain,"Typically amber in color, with aromas of dried cherries merging into apricots. Tangy and sharp on the palate, as is standard. Neither fruity nor deep, even according to Tondonia's track record. Newcomers may not be impressed.",Viña Tondonia Reserva,86,39,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,R. Lopez de Heredia
147053,Spain,"Extracted and raw, but with enough rustic country charm to make it worth a go. Four major grapes were thrown together, yielding cherry, beet and tomato aromas. The palate is ripe and edgy, with red plum and herb flavors. A tight, basic wine with ample tannin and acid.",ADA,86,10,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Finca Zubastía
147054,Spain,"Shows hickory-style wood aromas along with jerky, briar patch and cherry. Fairly fresh and forward, with a tangy palate dealing standard berry-cherry fare. Tight on the finish, with chocolate, pepper and coffee notes. A cut above the mass-market products; quite acceptable for the price",Roble,86,13,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,Blasón de San Juan
147072,Spain,"Mildly sweet but not very exact or dilineated on the nose. Flavors of lime, papaya and apple run toward green, but with good snap and zest the wine makes the grade. Finishes dry and snappy, with medium depth.",NA,86,15,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Serra da Estrela
147076,Spain,"The gold color and heavy oak aromas indicate barrel fermentation, which for this reviewer is not the ideal way to produce Verdejo. That said, this wine is made well, with plump melon and apple flavors cuddled in vanilla and wood resin. Very thick and woody; like being lost in the forest.",Fuente Elvira,86,22,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Pedro Escudero
147078,Spain,"Fairly mineral on the nose, with tropical fruit aromas rounding out the bouquet. Quite fresh and crisp, yet a bit hollow in the midpalate and on the finish. Overall this is a perfectly good Albariño, totally competent for quaffing or drinking with fish.",NA,86,20,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Valdamor
147088,Spain,"This good value features peach, apricot and some grapefruit on the nose, and in the rear is a full blast of citrus flavors. Juicy, a bit plump and full on the finish.",Salneval,86,10,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Condes de Albarei
147247,Spain,"Exhibits dry red fruits and mushroom on the nose, with accents of forest and spice. Somewhat minty and forward on the palate, and arguably a touch gritty and sweet. Raw as it might be, no one can say this wine doesn't have guts. Imported by The Marchetti Co.",NA,85,6,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Garnacha,Crucillon
147261,Spain,"Not a bad little quaffer. From Martinez-Bujanda, this colorful, ripe red is solid and chunky, with sweet aromas of berries and black plum. It is what you would call straightforward, with little to no complexity but lots of girth. Finishes full, almost creamy.",NA,85,10,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Tempranillo,Finca Antigua
147266,Spain,"More heavy and ripe than expected, with a creamy, almost lactic nose. Round on the palate, with plum and black-cherry fruit. Good acidity and overall balance keep it afloat. Finishes with coffee, chocolate and spice. Not a world beater but good.",Hombros,85,22,Northern Spain,Bierzo,NA,Mencía,Casar de Burbia
147267,Spain,"From Bodegas Bretón, this medium-weight red is a touch stewy, with peanut and black-olive aromas along with red licorice and Tootsie Roll. The palate offers strawberry and red cherry, while the finish is surprisingly tangy, with a shock of overt acidity.",Crianza,85,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Loriñon
147274,Spain,"Good but a bit less concentrated and pure than most. There's a whiff of sulfur on the nose, and in the mouth the fruit is solid but basic. Apple and melon are the key flavors, while the finish is clean but unspectacular. At 40,000 cases this is a large-production wine by Rías Baixas standards.",NA,85,NA,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,La Val
147275,Spain,"Gets off on the wrong foot, with aromas of corn and overripe apples. It steadies itself on the palate, where it's still sort of candied, with mango and cantaloupe stepping up. Has its qualities and registers entirely inoffensive. Good wine but not exciting.",NA,85,12,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Valdelapinta
147278,Spain,"Raisin and liqueur carry the oaked nose, yet the palate is quite hard and tannic. Reduced a bit across the tongue, with prune, milk chocolate and beet nots. Has power and a high price tag, but it fails to stir the beast.",Sango,85,55,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Rejadorada
147280,Spain,"Shows ample apple, pineapple and apricot on the nose, and follows with sweet melon, lime and other tropical fruit flavors. Pretty good in the mouth, as it's just sharp and balanced enough to make the grade. Fairly ripe and zesty as a whole.",NA,85,16,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Ermita Veracruz
147282,Spain,"A 50/50 blend of Verdejo and Viura that focuses on aromas of green herbs, citrus and nettles. The palate offers nice grapefruit and green papaya flavors, and they are backed by a smooth, medium-length finish.",Vina Mocen,85,10,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,White Blend,Bodegas Antano
147286,Spain,"Bacon and leather meld with modest black-fruit aromas on the nose of this Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon-Bobal blend. It's fairly plump, with blackberry and vanilla flavors. Ripe and tasty enough, but neither elevated nor complex.",Ceremonia Reserva De Autor,85,15,Levante,Utiel-Requena,NA,Tempranillo,Vicente Gandia
147289,Spain,"A black-colored, deeply extracted wine with charcoal, mint and burnt berry aromas. The palate is certainly ripe, as plum and berry flavors hit hard. But it's also limited in scope and complexity. A big wine with average personality. The blend is Tempranillo-Bobal-Syrah.",NA,85,20,Levante,Utiel-Requena,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Solo
147290,Spain,"A touch awkward to begin with, as the bouquet exhibits corn and hay along with ripe apple. The palate offers plenty of sweet, round flavors, particularly spiced apple and quince. Finishes soft, almost lazy. Good and ripe; not too acidic.",NA,85,18,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,Verdejo,Aura
147299,Spain,"Gold in color, with musky aromas that feature hints of butterscotch, ham and spice. Runs more racy in the mouth, with big lemon, orange and passion fruit flavors. Seems a touch unfocused and hefty, but for a bigger-styled wine it has its virtues.",NA,85,25,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Torroxal
147316,Spain,"Apple to start with, with some sweet doughiness to ease things along. Rather crisp and dry, which is all very classic. Flavors of white grapefruit and lemon are laser-like, while the finish is tight, almost sharp. Good quality; a little short. Made with Chardonnay and Parellada. Imported by North American Beverage Group.",Eric Brut Nature,87,22,Catalonia,Cava,NA,White Blend,Vallformosa
147328,Spain,"Classic and austere, with light toast and vanilla aromas in front of stark green apple and lime flavors. A natural dosage on a cava will result in tartness and sleekness, and here that's definitely what you get. Imported by Classical Wines.",Gran Reserva Brut Nature,87,25,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Huguet de Can Feixes
147421,Spain,"Light as if it were even older than it is, but nicely perfumed and mild in scope. The nose is mature and woodsy, while the palate is light, acidic and still dancing with plum and cherry. Best if you don't expect too much from it.",Crianza,85,16,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Zitua
147423,Spain,"A bit sweet on the nose, with notes of caramel, blackberry and earth. Better at first, where it comes on ripe. But then it turns a little sluggish and heavy as it opens. Still, it's largely a good Rioja, maybe more in the “modern” style than old-school.",Reserva,85,24,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Origin
147430,Spain,"Rich and creamy, but lacks zest and drive. The nose and palate offer sweet banana and oak, while the feel is almost too pillowy. Tastes more like a dessert than a dry white should. Still, it's neither bad nor poorly made.",Fermentado en Barrica de Roble,85,NA,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Chardonnay,Enate
147438,Spain,"More minty oak than fruit on the nose, with simple but clean candied fruit flavors. A bit short on depth and complexity, but totally drinkable, especially after some airing. Decent texture to the finish, with leftover spice and wood-based flavors.",Hoya De Cadenas Reserva Prevada,85,11,Levante,Utiel-Requena,NA,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Vicente Gandia
147441,Spain,"Starts with appropriate earth, cherry and vanilla notes, which are followed by spicy cherry, cranberry and raspberry flavors. Shows red fruit in a more traditional style, while the finish is warm, a bit oaky, and ultimately quite fresh.",Crianza,85,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Montecillo
147448,Spain,"Lean and woody, with mint, herbs and sawdust on the nose. The palate is surprisingly saturated and healthy, with pepper and vanilla running side by side with dry cherry and raspberry. A bit scouring and tannic.",Crianza,85,14,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,Torres de Anguix
147451,Spain,"A bit foresty and damp at first and then more open, fruity and lush later. The palate offers mostly snappy black cherry and cassis, while the finish is short but sturdy, with mild oak notes and decent tannins. Improves upon airing and will go with most foods.",Clos Maset Selección Especial,85,30,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon,Vallformosa
147452,Spain,"Grassy apple aromas carry a note of pickle, while the palate is chunky, full and delivers melon, pear and almond flavors. Chalk, mineral and green herbs are the secondary characteristics. Dry and long in the mouth.",NA,85,18,Northern Spain,Valdeorras,NA,Godello,Viña Somoza
147460,Spain,"This Tempranillo is spicy and solid enough. The wine comes across ripe and clean, with forward cherry and raspberry flavors. It's rather crisp and basic, but it seems highly food-friendly and ultimately it's easy to drink.",Hoya De Cadenas Reserva,85,9,Levante,Utiel-Requena,NA,Tempranillo,Gandia
147463,Spain,"Young and jumpy is this blend of Cabernet, Tempranillo and Merlot. The nose is dense and woody, with charcoal darkness. Tart blackberry flavors control the oily palate. Seems to be all over the place but goes down fairly well.",Crianza,85,19,Northern Spain,Navarra,NA,Red Blend,Arteaga
147476,Spain,"Slightly vegetal and green, with spicy, herbal aromas mixed with oak and earth. The palate is kind of light and leafy for a Cab-Merlot blend, but there's enough body and mouthfeel to keep it moving in the right direction. Decent but weighed down by the veggies.",Crianza,84,14,Catalonia,Pla de Bages,NA,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Bacasis
147485,Spain,"Creamy and yeasty, with mild apple and bread-based aromas. Nice in the mouth, with citrus leading the way. Shows ample kick and acidity, with length and balance on the finish. Perfectly good overall, if not overly exciting. Imported by Bon Vivant Imports.",Brut Nature,87,20,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Castellroig
147493,Spain,"Different from the crowd. The nose concedes light raspberry and cranberry aromas, while the palate is a pink passion play that's not that easy to figure out. It's tangy, with citrus and berry mixing in an unconventional manner. Interesting in the mouth; a quality wine. Not run of the mill. Imported by De Maison Selections, Inc.",Rosado Brut Reserva,87,20,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Avinyó
147605,Spain,"Toast, butterscotch and oxidized apple aromas precede a heavy, nearly overripe palate loaded down with sticky apple, nectarine and banana. Where it does well is in texture, which is correct and pleasant. Finishes long and heavy. A different breed.",Brut,85,11,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Torre Oria
147606,Spain,"Earthy and ripe, with jammy, borderline stewy fruit that carries a meaty edge. Fairly one-line in terms of complexity, but it stands on its feet and tastes pretty solid. With some rustic character, it'll do the job.",50th Aniversario Sangre de Toro,85,10,Catalonia,Catalonia,NA,Rhône-style Red Blend,Torres
147614,Spain,"If it seems dirty at first, time will reveal tobacco and leather aromas along with black plum and coffee. Seems more sour than you might expect, with pie cherry and rhubarb flavors. Really high-toned on the finish, where it teeters on the brink of sour. Not bad but not endearing.",Reserva,84,27,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,Blasón de San Juan
147615,Spain,"Tons of color but the nose is a bit soupy, with aromas of heavy oak, black fruit, tomato and herbs. A blend of 60% Garnacha and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon that's solid but shrill. Hits with extract and tannins, but the integration and flavors don't quite achieve the next level.",Tinto,84,20,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Red Blend,Care
147618,Spain,"Plump and a bit stewy, but the flavors manage to take over in a fairly positive way. Upon sipping you take in blackberry and prune, but also some murkiness. Not much in the midpalate, but decent around the edges.",Crianza,84,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Valcortes
147619,Spain,"Muddled to start, with chocolate and earth aromas along with heavy, seemingly chewable berry fruit. Big on the palate, with slightly overripe plum backed by overt vanilla and brown sugar. A three-grape mix of Prieto Pecudo, Mencía and Tempranillo.",Doce Meses,84,17,Northern Spain,Vino Tierra de León,NA,Red Blend,Villacezan
147636,Spain,"Starts by emitting baked plum and leather aromas, and the bouquet is backed by solid but lean black cherry, plum and raspberry flavors. Light to medium in build, with a moderately strong but bland finish that's only slightly toasted. Short on subtance but good as far as what's here.",1+1=3 U més U fan tres,84,13,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Caliu
147645,Spain,"Starts with fruit cocktail aromas, which are backed by semisweet orange and lemon flavors. Zesty and clean, with pretty good mouthfeel but not much depth of flavor, complexity or nuance. A good wine on its best day.",Barona,84,20,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Oriel
147648,Spain,"Honey, pear and sugar cane are the dominating flavors in thi sticky, rich, unctuous sweet wine. There isn't a whole lot else to say about it: you have to have an aggressive penchant for candy to get into this style of wine.",Fusta Nova,84,11,Levante,Valencia,NA,Moscatel,Vicente Gandia
147649,Spain,"Light and sweet to the nose, with aromas of honey, which isn't normal for the usually zesty, citrusy Verdejo. Pear and apple are the dominant flavors on a palate that's more smooth and lush than racy and snappy. Strange in how it's almost creamy.",Elverite,84,11,Northern Spain,Vino Tierra de León,NA,Verdejo,Villacezan
147653,Spain,"Slightly prickly and green, but overall it's a decent, mildly herbal Garnacha that will do the trick. Basic red-fruit flavors carry a note of tomato and leather, while the finish is generally tight and crisp.",Old Vine,84,8,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Garnacha,Valcantara
147654,Spain,"Jammy and candied to start with. Black cherry, boysenberry and plum flavors are friendly but basic, while the texture and finish are nothing to take issue with. Perfectly fruity and easy, but runs short on complexity.",NA,84,12,Northern Spain,Somontano,NA,Moristel,Alquézar
147688,Spain,"Light and lean, with lively fruit aromas and flavors. Freshness is what this wine pushes, because there's not much weight or overt sweetness to it. Light apple, a touch of pear, and some lemon-lime is the most that you're going to get. Still, it works as a palate freshener. Imported by Jorge Ordoñez Selections.",Leopardi Brut Nature,87,18,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Llopart
147780,Spain,"Maybe Pinot Noir isn't meant to be in Catalonia. This has a burnt nose, with medicinal cherry and cranberry aromas and flavors. Starts sweet then goes a bit raspy. Unusual.",Brut Rosado,84,NA,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Pinot Noir,Codorníu
147788,Spain,"Heavy and high-voltage, with a strong whiff of green bean to the nose. Flavors of raisin, raspberry and green pepper combine to create a palate that has its high moments as well as its faults. Tight on the finish, with lots of tobacco and bell pepper.",Gran Reserva,84,25,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,LAN
147789,Spain,"A Monastrell with 10% Cabernet, and it is heavily minty and woody, with leaner than expected fruit and a whole lot of resin and vanilla setting things off. Decent structure and mouthfeel, and with plenty of oak. Not bad but nothing too exciting.",Unico,84,27,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Merum
147792,Spain,"Some heft and richness propel this bargain wine to a higher level. There are even some bacon, beef and leather aromas in addition to the plump fruit scents. Chewy and chunky, with flavors of black cherry and raspberry. Yet still tangy and refreshing enough to avoid being clumsy.",NA,84,7,Levante,Utiel-Requena,NA,Tempranillo,Vicente Gandia
147802,Spain,"Not too refined, but still pretty tasty. The palate offers chewy cherry and raspberry fruit, while the finish is spicy and zesty to the point that it creates a tingle. Somewhat sugary, but definitely an easy one to drink.",Crianza,84,10,Central Spain,La Mancha,NA,Red Blend,Finca Antigua
147807,Spain,"Nice in terms of texture, but a bit strange and hard to identify as far as aromas and flavors go. The nose tosses up Sherry and syrup notes, while the flavors run toward Granny Smith apples and lime. Shockingly, the finish is sweet. Confounding and hard to appreciate, but not a bad cava.",Brut,84,15,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Montsarra
147813,Spain,"Candied and thick right from the begininning. This is a heavy, chunky southern Spanish red comprised of 60% Monastrell and 20% each of Cabernet and Syrah. The final result is rustic, stewy and fat, with gooey chocolate and stewed plum flavors. Big and ripe but devoid of finesse.",NA,83,10,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Mad Dogs & Englishmen
147814,Spain,"Candied and round, with tangy melon and citrus flavors. Does best early on before losing focus and finishing flat.

147815,Spain,"Hard and funky at first, with a nose that shows leather, scallion and bitter herbs. Seems to find its way a bit better in the mouth, where apple and papaya flavors are in the lead. Still, it remains unfocused and clumsy throughout.",NA,83,13,Northern Spain,Rueda,NA,White Blend,Hermanos Lurton
147817,Spain,"More savory and spicy than fruity, with bramble and leather aromas dominating any sweetness that might want to escape. A touch aggressive in the mouth, with lively but hard raspberry and other red-fruit flavors. Finishes dry and salty, with heat. Includes 17% Carignan.",Terrasola,83,16,Catalonia,Catalunya,NA,Syrah,Jean León
147819,Spain,"Tilts the scale on the heavy side. The nose is bolstered by weighty applesauce and petrol yet the palate is surprisingly lean and lemony in terms of flavors. Rather oily, and not endowed with much brightness.",NA,83,20,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Villarei
147820,Spain,"Sweet plum and raisin on the nose go heavy and dull after time exposed to air. The palate offers some raspberry flavor, but with tang and finishing bitterness. Thick but raw.",Ia,83,9,Northern Spain,Calatayud,NA,Garnacha,Villarroya de la Sierra
147824,Spain,"This perennial bargain-basement red offers solid fruit with herbal overtones, while the flavor profile veers toward cherries and licorice. Gets raisiny and more ponderous the more time you spend analyzing it.",NA,83,7,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Tempranillo,René Barbier
147830,Spain,"Dry leather, leaves, burnt spice and pepper lead it off, followed by tart flavors of plum and berry. Never seems to find a higher level of quality as it falls off on the palate, finishing with rhubarb and cranberry.",Higueruela,83,10,Central Spain,Almansa,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Tintoralba
147831,Spain,"Dark and smoky, almost like a burnt wooden match on top of plum purée. Runs a bit tart in the mouth for Syrah, with red raspberry and cherry flavors. Firm and lean in the mouth.",Mas La Roca Selección Especial,83,30,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Syrah,Vallformosa
147835,Spain,"Prieto Picudo is the grape, and the wine yields robust aromas of radish and red fruits. Very tangy, almost citrusy on the palate. Finishes quite lean and tart. A screechy wine without a lot of happiness.",VCZ Molendores,83,15,Northern Spain,Vino Tierra de León,NA,Prieto Picudo,Villacezan
147837,Spain,"Hard and waxy on the nose, with little to no appealing fruit aromas. The palate is loaded with sharp lemon and green apple flavors. Lacks friendliness; healthy in terms of feel but borders on sour.",NA,82,15,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Mar de Frades
147856,Spain,"Cherry and dusty cinnamon aromas blend with a touch of cough drop on the nose, while the full-bodied palate pits spicy berry and plum against rather soft acidity. Finishes sweet for a burst, then dry and peppery. Alluring rosado. Imported by European Cellars.",Grand Cuvée Rosé,87,35,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Gramona
147967,Spain,"Sweet yet snappy, with youthful aromas of candied fruit. Slightly tangy on the tongue, with raspberry and plum flavors. Tastes clean, with a soft mouthfeel. Very standard, simple and easygoing.",Dehesa de Villacezan,84,11,Northern Spain,Vino Tierra de León,NA,Red Blend,Villacezan
147968,Spain,"On one hand it shows black cherry, plum and licorice. On the other there are green, lettuce-like aromas and flavors. Along the way is some tang on the palate, length to the herbal finish, and an adequate mouthfeel.",Cosecha de Familia Félix Martinez Reserva,84,45,Central Spain,Vinos de Madrid,NA,Red Blend,Vinos Jeromin
147969,Spain,"Black in color and saturated with plum, fruit cake and vanilla aromas. Big in the mouth but clumsy, with dense, thumping black cherry and blackberry flavors. In fact, everything about the wine is black, including the burnt, licorice-tinged finish. Ponderous in the long run.",Tinto,84,10,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,NA,Tinto del Pais,Torres de Anguix
147974,Spain,"A little heavier than ideal, with a touch of raisin along with candied black cherry on the bouquet. Better in the mouth, where it comes to life on the wings of good acids, modest tannins, and simple but proper berry fruit flavors.",Crianza,84,10,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas LAN
147977,Spain,"Starts somewhat cooked and stewy before finding a better, fresher, fruitier groove. Weighty and full, with bright colors and aggressive flavors. Plum, berry and cherry notes dominate. Persistent airing unveils additional ripeness and soft tannins.",Nerola,84,20,Catalonia,Catalonia,NA,Red Blend,Torres
147983,Spain,"Very sweet, with cherry cola and licorice nibs comprising the nose. It's nothing more than simple Garnacha, which means it's all about red fruit and sunshine. Not a fine wine, but good for those with a sweet tooth.",Tinto,84,7,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,NA,Grenache,Marqués de Reala
147986,Spain,"This co-op wine is almost a good deal, but ultimately it does not show enough depth or elegance to reach the next level.

147991,Spain,"Yellow in color and heavy on the nose. Toast is the lead aroma, and with that there's some caramel and peanut butter. Dry and lean in the mouth, with lemon and grapefruit notes.

148024,Spain,"A ton of bell pepper and tomato sits front and center on the nose, which almost ensures that the flavors will be herbal and leafy.

Bland apple and orange flavors are okay but not that stimulating, while the overall take is that it tastes too much like citrus juice and not enough like balanced wine.",NA,81,20,Galicia,Rías Baixas,NA,Albariño,Soleira
148032,Spain,"Violet in color, with burnt rubber, cherry and plum on the lively nose. Things go south from there, however, as the palate is too snappy and austere to support the flavors. It's 90% Carignan and much like a tart Italian Dolcetto. Imported by Hand Picked Selections.",Carinyena,81,11,Catalonia,Terra Alta,NA,Carignane,Arcs
148034,Spain,"Thick on the nose, with prickly, mildly pickled aromas. Typical of Jumilla, the wine is big and candied, with soft tannins and spiky, out-of-place acidity. Finishes tart and crisp with virtually no second level to speak of. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Viña Honda,81,12,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Red Blend,Bodegas Silvano Garcia
148035,Spain,"Rusty in color, with nutty, leathery aromas that feature little to no fruit. Quite sour in the mouth, and drying on the finish. Just not that pleasant; it's definitely not what you'd expect from Merlot. Imported by North American Beverage Group.",Masia Freyes Collección Especial,81,30,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Merlot,Vallformosa
148036,Spain,"Jumbled, jammy and disjointed, with a heavy load of extracted, overdone fruit. Deep and hard, with funky aromas and a disconcerting mouthfeel. A wine with issues. Imported by VinLozano Imports.",Reserva,81,20,Northern Spain,Toro,NA,Tinta de Toro,Viñalcasta
148038,Spain,"Balsamic vinegar, burnt coffee and pepper aromas create a bouquet that's more like salad dressing than fine wine. The flavors are peppery and herbal, yet the body is full and the mouthfeel not bad. A blend of four grapes, led by Garnacha and Tempranillo. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Tinto Joven,80,11,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Red Blend,Señorio de Aylés
148039,Spain,"Mulchy and earthy from start to finish, with distant flavors that barely register. Not overly bad but a true cipher of a wine. Imported by Kensington Distributors Inc.",Superior,80,9,Levante,Utiel-Requena,NA,Tempranillo,Torre Oria
148040,Spain,"Foxy, animal aromas don't distinguish it, while robust but mulchy berry and plum flavors fail to take it very far. Barely acceptable. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",NA,80,10,Northern Spain,Cariñena,NA,Garnacha,Señorio de Aylés
148279,Spain,"Light and lemony, with a hint of green astringency. Tangerine with hints of mushroom on the palate run toward a solid but lean finish. Has zest but little roundness. Fresh and crisp, but not the most friendly bubbly.",Brut Nature Reserva de la Familia,86,22,Catalonia,Cava,NA,White Blend,Juvé y Camps
148283,Spain,"Not every wine is easy to read: this one is a case in point. The nose offers sweet toffee and apricot, while the palate starts out toasty and dry before unveiling ripe peach and brown sugar. The dosage on this wine is unusual. A funky bubbly that's worth a try.",Cuvée Dessert Dulce,86,20,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Pinot Noir,Parxet
148360,Spain,"Licorice, pepper and raisin join forces on a can't-miss bouquet that's all Monastrell and all southern Spain. Dark and candied, with tons of cooked brown sugar. This is what you'd call big and tannic, with a hard, grabby mouthfeel. One glass we can recommend; two or more might be tough to handle.",Dulce,86,24,Levante,Jumilla,NA,Monastrell,Bodegas Silvano Garcia
148369,Spain,"Loud and basic, with ripe fruit aromas and flavors but also a detectable heaviness. The palate pushes ripe apple and pear, while the finish is big but quiet. Deep and dense but dull along the edges.",Gran Cuvée,86,18,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Gramona
148536,Spain,"Avinyo does not make cookie-cutter cavas, and thus this wine is out of the ordinary and not always the better for it. The nose is lean and spritzy, with aromas equal to lemon-lime. The palate is drawn in for a brut, with tart flavors. Slim in profile, but not a bad or indifferent wine.",Brut Reserva,85,16,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Avinyó
148638,Spain,"Dusty cherry aromas start out full and turn more green and grassy with time. Sweet grapefruit and tang carry the palate, and the finish is a rush of acidity. Good but odd.",Chantal Brut Rosé,85,20,Catalonia,Cava,NA,White Blend,Vallformosa
148645,Spain,"Full and heavy, with mango and orange juice flavors. Creamy in the mouth, with a full, foamy feel. Good citrus and apple characteristics keep it moving forward, while the weight is definitely there. Good in cava cocktails or as a Spanish mimosa.",Brut,85,11,Catalonia,Cava,NA,Sparkling Blend,Paul Cheneau
149059,Spain,"Shows yeasty, earthy, dusty aromas, with just a slight trace of fruit. There are also mild fruity flavors. It's slightly sweet as a semi-seco should be, but has adequate acidity and decent length finishing with some richness.",Semi Seco Reserva,86,9,Catalonia,Penedès,NA,Champagne Blend,Jaume Serra
149240,Spain,"With its dried-cherry and rose-petal aromas and flavors, this beautiful, mature red is every bit the equivalent of a fine, older Bordeaux or Burgundy. Cumin and cinnamon show on the palate and the refined finish is lovely, with anise and white pepper accents.",Faustino I Rioja Gran Reserva,94,185,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Faustino
149242,Spain,"The bouquet of dried cherries, plums, prunes and tobacco opens to a palate of dense fruit that's dry and structured. This wine is big, but even textured and not heavy. Shows finely focused fruit and good grip. The dark fruit flavors add spice accents on the long finish. Cellar Selection.",Rioja Gran Reserva,92,75,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Campillo
149245,Spain,"Deep, sweet dark-cherry fruit forms a solid foundation for this impressive wine. There's a touch of menthol oak on the nose; plenty of leather and earth accents in the mouth, coupled with good acidity, keep the palate complex and lively. Finishes long, with full—but not harsh—tannins. Editors' Choice.",Faustino I Rioja Gran Reserva,92,26,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Faustino
149247,Spain,"Beautifully balanced, this shows all the positive attributes of mature Rioja. Though 30 years old, it is still very alive, with deep sweet fruit that wears tobacco and meat accents. Anise accents the ultrasmooth palate. Full of complex flavors, with a lingering finish.",Faustino I Rioja Gran Reserva,92,125,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Faustino
149330,Spain,"Nose of ripe spicy fruit with tobacco and earth accents. Similar full, chewy flavors ride the plush mouthfeel. The long finish is dense and dark.",Rioja Reserva,90,24,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Campillo
149429,Spain,"This is classic Rioja Reserva, with textbook cherry, earth, leather and meaty Tempranillo flavors supported by a good acid spine and moderate tannins. The elegant finish is dry and spicy.",Faustino V Riserva,89,17,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Faustino
149510,Spain,"Sweet cherry and dried-rose notes on the nose are offset by some noticeable barnyardy scents. Elegant, but less generous on the palate and decidedly drier than the much older 1970, this finishes with dry tannins.",Faustino I Rioja Gran Reserva,89,72,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Faustino
149601,Spain,"Toasty oak and tobacco shadings are wrapped around the dark-cherry fruit core of this 100% Tempranillo wine. The full and supple palate shows good depth of fruit, leather and spice accents. This handsome modern-style Rioja finishes long and tangy, with moderate tannins.",Rioja Crianza,88,15,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Faustino
149819,Spain,"This pleasant wine shows clean apple, hay and mildly floral aromas. Even and round on the tongue, it has a slightly waxy feel and decent acidity. Green apple, citrus and slightly nutty flavors play on the finish, with a crisp, dry grapefruity aftertaste that lingers. Best Buy.",NA,86,7,Central Spain,Tierra Manchuela,NA,Viura,Santana
149858,Spain,"Dried cherry and spice aromas and flavors accented by peppery, meaty notes mark this joven (young wine). A blend of 80% Tempranillo and 20% Mazuela, it has a light, even mouthfeel. The acids are tangy, and a little prickly now, and the bright finish shows spicy elements.",Faustino VII,86,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Bodegas Faustino
149936,Spain,"A straightforward basic red, with dried cherry, oak and slightly meaty scents. The palate shows dark fruit and spice flavors, medium weight and an even texture. Finishes with decent length and tangy, spicy notes.",NA,84,7,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Tempranillo,Santana
149993,Spain,"This Rioja rose displays a full bouquet of rose petal, spice and the slightly meaty element that Tempranillo so often shows. No White Zinfandel, this is a fairly lean and dry wine with spicy notes, a decent match for hors d'oeuvres or light meals.",Faustino V Rosado,84,12,Northern Spain,Rioja,NA,Rosé,Bodegas Faustino
